One mini-UAV was also lost due to jamming. Over the last two months, 82 per cent of SMM long-range UAV flights have encountered GPS signal interference. The Mission had to disable its camera system at the Oktiabr mine near Donetsk city on 19 April to avoid interference with its monitoring, after two men in camouflage-clothing had mounted two cameras on the SMM’s camera mast and the tower on which the mast is emplaced (see Spot Report 10/2021).",
