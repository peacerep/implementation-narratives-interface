TPMT congratulates GPH and MILF Pa nels on historic first  step in 
decommissioning 
 
Alistair MacDonald, chai r of the Third-Party Mon itoring Team (TPMT) set  up by the Panels 
to monitor the implement ation of the Comprehensi ve Agreement on the Ban gsamoro (CAB), 
said today that Tuesda y’s successful initial d ecommissioning ceremo nies in Simuay, 
Maguindanao, marked a  historic step forward</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">i n</a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">the implementation o f the CAB, and 
confirmed the MILF’s co mmitment to continue on  the path to peace.</a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="129" name="129">In congratulating the Pa nels on this achievemen t, MacDonald said “the MILF this week 
confirmed their sincere c ommitment to the implem entation of the CAB, wit h the successful 
completion of this initial stage of decommissioning , covering 75 highpowere d or crew-served 
weapons, and 145 MILF combatants.”</a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">Noting that this was only  the first step in the deco mmissioning process, wit h three other and 
much more substantial sta ges that should now follo w in line with the implem entation of other 
aspects of the CAB, Ma cDonald added that “the first step in any journey is often the most 
difficult, and it is tremen dously encouraging to se e that this has pushed thr ough, and that the 
journey has really begun,  even at a time when the Bangsamoro Basic Law i s still undergoing 
substantive discussions in  Congress”. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">MacDonald noted also th at this high-profile event saw the weapons being h anded over to the 
Independent Decommiss ioning Body so that they  may be put beyond use , and the former 
combatants being given s upport to help them retur n to a peaceful and  produ ctive civilian life. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">It was in no sense a “sur render” (as some comme ntators had wrongly claim ed), but rather an 
honourable fulfilment of commitments entered int o by the government and  the MILF in the 
CAB. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">MacDonald and his TPM T colleagues had been pr esent in Simuay to observ e the ceremonies, 
and were encouraged to s ee that a number of legisl ators were also present, a nd will be able to 
report to their colleagues  in Congress on the deter mination shown by the M ILF to implement 
their commitments under  the CAB, helping bring an end to the decades of disastrous conflict 
which have wracked part s of Mindanao.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">Tuesday also marked the beginning of the current i n-country session of the T PMT, which sees
