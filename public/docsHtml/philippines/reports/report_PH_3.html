<p><a id="1" name="1">Summary  In line with the terms of reference of the Third-Party Monitoring Team, this fifth public report is intended to provide an overall assessment of developments in the implementation of the Agreements between the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).   </a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">It covers the period from July 2017 to February 2019, continuing from the fourth public report on the period March 2016 to June 2017.  </a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">Upon detailed review of Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), the TPMT assessed that the passage of the BOL reflects the spirit and intent of the Parties as it serves to enact the key provisions of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB), particularly the ministerial form of government and fiscal autonomy.</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">The BOL also has some deviations and variations from the CAB, such as the Wali, and the non-inclusion of the “opt-in” clause and policing powers of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).  </a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">The TPMT observed the plebiscite, particularly in Cotabato City on 21 January 2019 and in Lanao del Norte and North Cotabato on 6 February 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">The successful ratification of the BOL and the inclusion of Cotabato City and 63 barangays in North Cotabato paved the way towards the transition period from Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) to the BARMM, with the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) as its interim government.</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">However, there was relatively little progress in the preparations for the transition.  </a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">We note that the overall progress for the implementation of the normalization component of the peace process has rather been slow and has significant delays in several aspects.</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">Given that the ratification of the BOL would trigger the decommissioning of 30% of MILF forces and weapons, there is an expectation that there would be rapid developments immediately after the plebiscite.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">However, some crucial issues remain unresolved, such as on the list of combatants (whether it should be partial or full) and t he ar r angement s  f or  s t</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">or i ng MI LF weapons .  </a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">The i s s ue of  t he car r yi ng of  f</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">i r ear</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">ms  of  t he MILF contingent of the Joint Peace and Security Teams (JPSTs) also remains unresolved.  </a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">Moreover, the measures undertaken to</a></p>

<p><a id="17" name="17">v i d e d  s o c</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">i o-economic packages for the initial 145 decommissioned combatants, as well as for by the transformation of camps still do not seem to meet the expectations of the individuals and the local communities.  </a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">The Bangsamoro Normalization Trust Fund (BNTF) still has not been created due to unresolved issues with regard to its nature, mechanism, and funding sources.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">Its creation is an urgent task for the Parties, as key components of normalization are hinged on the BNTF.  </a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">TPMT FIFTH PUBLIC REPORT  March 2019   
</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">Page 2 of 31  There has also been a little progress with regard to the amnesty for the MILF rank-and-file and in implementing key recommendations of the Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC).  </a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">The ceasefire agreement between the Parties remains intact as the GPH and MILF remain committed in preserving the gains of the peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">Ceasefire violations were mainly due to uncoordinated law enforcement operations on the side of the GPH and rido and display of firearms on the MILF side.  </a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">The TPMT also notes the progress made in promoting convergence between the MILF and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) peace processes.  </a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">The TPMT is of the view that it is imperative for the Parties to:</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">-</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">Discuss and agree on how to move forward with provisions of the CAB that were not included or were amended in the BOL;</a></p>

<p><a id="86" name="86">Some of the key panel meetings include the following:</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">-</a></p>

<p><a id="89" name="89">-</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">on 20 October 2017 also in Davao City, the Panels extensively discussed the following matters:</a></p>

<p><a id="104" name="104">on 6 March 2018 in Cotabato City, the Panels renewed the mandates of the International Monitoring Team (IMT) and the Ad Hoc Joint Action Group (AHJAG), and discussed the JCC, Coordination Team for the Transition (CT4T), Joint Normalization Committee (JNC), Independent Decommissioning Body (IDB), etc.  </a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">One of the key events in the peace process during this period was the Bangsamoro Assembly held on 17 November 2017 in Maguindanao Province.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">Tens of thousands of people from different parts of the Bangsamoro and surrounding areas as well as guests from the international community attended the event in order to show support for the peace process and to hear from President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, who was the guest speaker.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">On other occasions, the President’s statements urging Congress to fast-track the passage of the BBL1 boosted general public optimism and these sent a strong signal to Congress that the BBL remained a top priority of the administration.                                                          </a></p>

Page 6 of 31  b) Enactment of the Bangsamoro Organic Law in Congress After the draft BBL was finalized by the Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC) on 16 June 2017, it was submitted to President Duterte in a ceremony held on 17 July 2017 a t  Malacañan Palace, Manila in the presence of the Senate President, House Speaker, a number of members of the Cabinet, and the MILF Chair.</a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">The draft BBL was then transmitted to the House of Representatives and the Senate but corresponding bills were not immediately filed and discussed in the appropriate committees.</a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">On 4 September 2017, the President gave assurance to the MILF leadership who had been concerned about this delay that his administration was committed to pass the BTC version.2  Unlike in the previous administration, there was little discussion on the BBL between the BTC and the Office of the President.</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">The immediate transmittal to both Houses of Congress significantly hastened the process (note that the back-and-forth deliberations between the BTC and the Office of the President on the BBL under the Aquino administration took almost 5 months).</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">However, it can be argued that the lack of such discussions removed a critical opportunity for the Parties to formally discuss key provisions as well as reach consensus over a range of issues including constitutional questions, which may have adversely impacted the subsequent political-legislative process leading to the passage of a Bangsamoro law that has several key departures from the CAB.  </a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">The BBL was filed as House Bill (H.B.) No. 6475 on 26 September 2017 by Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez together with more than 70 other Representatives.</a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">However, there were also other bills filed by Rep. Gloria Arroyo (H.B. No. 6121) and Rep. Khalid Dimaporo (H.B. No. 6263) which contained provisions significantly different from the BTC-drafted BBL.</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">Senate Bill (S.B.) No. 1608 was filed by then Senate President Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III on 6 November 2017, followed by S.B.

<p><a id="148" name="148">Similarly, the House of Representatives through its joint committee held over 20 public consultations on the proposed BBL, such as Cotabato City, North Cotabato, Davao City, Sulu, and Basilan, Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur.</a></p>
<p><a id="149" name="149">These Congressional and Senate hearings contributed to increasing both public awareness of and public confidence in the peace process, complementing the consultations and forums being conducted by the BTC and the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP).</a></p>
<p><a id="150" name="150">On top of the previous public hearings and consultations held under the Aquino administration by the previous Congress, BTC and OPAPP, these discussions have also given an opportunity for both supporters and critics of the BBL to express their support and concerns.</a></p>
<p><a id="151" name="151">The period of amendments in the Senate and the period of interpellation in the House of Representatives began on 28 May 2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="152" name="152">On 29 May 2018, President Duterte certified the BBL (S.B. No. 1717 and H.B.</a></p>
<p><a id="153" name="153">No. 6475) as an urgent bill.</a></p>
<p><a id="154" name="154">The next day, the House of Representatives approved its version of the BBL;</a></p>
<p><a id="155" name="155">and the day after, the Senate approved its own version.  </a></p>
<p><a id="156" name="156">From 9 to 13 July 2018, legislators from both the Senate and House of Representatives then gathered in a bicameral conference committee in order to reconcile the conflicting provisions of the 2 versions of the BBL;</a></p>
<p><a id="157" name="157">and on 18 July, the committee finalized the bill.</a></p>
<p><a id="158" name="158">The Senate and the House of Representatives were expected to separately ratify the bill so that the President can sign it into law hours before his third (3rd) State of the Nation Address on 23 July.</a></p>
<p><a id="159" name="159">However, due to political events unrelated to the bill, the House of Representatives failed to ratify the bill on that day, doing so only the next day.</a></p>
<p><a id="160" name="160">On 26 July 2018, the President signed the bill into law which is R.A. No. 11054 entitled the “Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (OLBARMM)” or the so-called Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL).  </a></p>
<p><a id="161" name="161">The TPMT has reviewed the final text of the BOL in detail and it is our assessment that the Law as passed by Congress and approved by the President reflects the spirit and intent of the Parties as outlined in the CAB and serves to enact its key provisions.</a></p>
<p><a id="162" name="162">However, R.A. No. 11054 falls short of fully implementing the CAB as it leaves out several important provisions from the CAB, and it also introduced some revisions to provisions in the CAB.  </a></p>
<p><a id="163" name="163">It is relevant to note that it is not necessary for the BOL to repeat all elements of the CAB – the BOL is a piece of legislation to implement the peace agreement, but it does not replace TPMT FIFTH PUBLIC REPORT  March 2019   
Page 8 of 31  nor substitute that agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="164" name="164">Both are now in force, the CAB as an executive commitment between the Filipino people (represented by the President) and the MILF, and the BOL as a law of the Republic of the Philippines.</a></p>
<p><a id="165" name="165">However, it is  important to document  variances between the BOL and the CAB as these would be significant in pursuing  and eventually  assessing the  fullness of peace  implementation.   </a></p>
<p><a id="166" name="166">Particular observations of the TPMT with respect to the CAB and the BOL are the following:</a></p>
<p><a id="167" name="167">-</a></p>
<p><a id="168" name="168">The majority of the core elements of the CAB are fully reflected in the BOL.</a></p>
<p><a id="169" name="169">For example, the ministerial form of government, the guaranteed annual block grant, and the 75%-25% sharing in taxes in favor of the Bangsamoro Government have been retained.</a></p>
<p><a id="170" name="170">We note that both the GPH and MILF have expressed satisfaction with the substance of the law.  </a></p>
<p><a id="171" name="171">- There are also some amendments that expanded the powers of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), for example in terms of percentages in t he sharing of revenues, with the BOL providing 100% of revenues from exploration, development, and use of all natural resources including mines and minerals in the region to the Bangsamoro Government.</a></p>
<p><a id="172" name="172">- In addition, the BOL provides clarifications to certain elements of the CAB.</a></p>
<p><a id="173" name="173">It has, for example, fixed the formula for the block grant, which would be 5% of net collections of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Bureau of Customs (BOC), and specified the amounts for the Special Development Fund, which would be Php 50 Billion for ten (10) years or Php 5 Billion per year.  </a></p>
<p><a id="174" name="174">- In addition, there are a few elements appearing in the BOL which had not been foreseen in the CAB, but which both Parties with Congress approval believed could improve on the arrangements proposed in the CAB.</a></p>
<p><a id="175" name="175">One example is the establishment of the office of the Wali, as the titular and ceremonial head of the BARMM, under the general supervision of the President, and responsible inter alia for administering the oath of office of Members of the Bangsamoro Parliament, and for dissolving the Parliament upon the advice of the Chief Minister, in case of a vote of no confidence against the government of the day.</a></p>
<p><a id="176" name="176">- Some key CAB provisions have been left out of the law.</a></p>
<p><a id="177" name="177">Of particular significance are the removal of the following:</a></p>
<p><a id="178" name="178">the “opt-in” clause (FAB, Section V, Clause 3), the delineation of powers into three (3) categories (national, concurrent, and exclusive), and the policing powers of the Bangsamoro Government.</a></p>
<p><a id="179" name="179">The section on Basic Rights was removed;</a></p>
<p><a id="180" name="180">however, the BOL includes reference to the Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act (IPRA) and provides additional assurances on the rights of non-Islamized indigenous peoples in the BARMM.  </a></p>
<p><a id="181" name="181">TPMT FIFTH PUBLIC REPORT  March 2019   
Page 9 of 31  - A number of the basic principles specifically included in the CAB are not mentioned in the BOL, such as the right to self-determination, the asymmetrical relationship between the National Government and the Bangsamoro Government, and parity of esteem.  </a></p>
<p><a id="182" name="182">- There are also several amendments which depart significantly from the CAB.</a></p>
<p><a id="183" name="183">For example, the reckoning of votes for the inclusion of North Cotabato barangays, Lanao del Norte municipalities, and Isabela City, Basilan into the BARMM were subject to consent of their respective “mother units”;</a></p>
<p><a id="184" name="184">in addition, the Bangsamoro Government will not exercise exclusive powers over inland waters that provide energy to power- generating plants (e.g., Lanao Lake).   </a></p>

<p><a id="227" name="227">On 31 August 2018, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) released a Memorandum announcing that the plebiscite to ratify the BOL will be held on 21 January 2019 and that the campaign period will run from 09 December 2018 up to 19 January 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="228" name="228">The same memo also stated that 3 special satellite voters’ registration would be conducted from 11 to 13 September 2018 in 16 venues in the provinces of Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Lanao del Norte, and North Cotabato;</a></p>

<p><a id="231" name="231">During the special satellite voter registrations, hundreds of MILF officials and combatants, including MILF Chairman Murad Ebrahim himself, as well as ordinary Moro citizens, registered to become voters and be able to take part in the upcoming plebiscite.</a></p>
<p><a id="232" name="232">The COMELEC waived some of the voters’ registration requirements.</a></p>
<p><a id="233" name="233">Despite these arrangements, many people still protested that they were unable to register because of the limited period provided and lack of required identification documents.  </a></p>
<p><a id="234" name="234">On 26 September 2018, the COMELEC promulgated Resolution No. 10425, the “Rules and Regulations Governing the Conduct of the Plebiscite to Ratify R.A.</a></p>
<p><a id="235" name="235">No. 11054”.</a></p>
<p><a id="236" name="236">The resolution listed down the questions to be asked to the voters, and provided for guidelines on the petition by a local government unit for voluntary inclusion, petition by at least ten percent (10%) of the registered voters in a local government unit for inclusion, special registration of voters, accreditation of Citizens’ Arms of the COMELEC for the plebiscite, information campaign, accreditation of domestic and international observers for the plebiscite, mass media accreditation, precincts and voting centers, etc.  </a></p>
<p><a id="237" name="237">The TPMT notes that the CAB (in the Annex on Transition Arrangements and Modalities) provided for the creation of a “robust international-domestic monitoring body” to be accredited by the COMELEC to monitor the administration of the plebiscite.</a></p>
<p><a id="238" name="238">However, no such body was created;</a></p>
<p><a id="239" name="239">instead, the COMELEC, following its usual process, accredited a total of 627 international and local monitors mostly coming from media organizations.  </a></p>
<p><a id="240" name="240">There were fewer than twenty monitors from international organizations and the diplomatic community, who did not gather as a coordinated monitoring body, and who were concentrated in Cotabato City and neighbouring areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="241" name="241">On 13 December 2018, the COMELEC promulgated Resolution No. 10464, the “Rules on Voting, Counting, and Canvassing of Votes in Connection with the Plebiscite to ratify R.A.</a></p>

<p><a id="245" name="245">The COMELEC explained that the 2-day plebiscite would “allow time for the full resolution of petitions for voluntary inclusion in the plebiscite”.4 The COMELEC had received 103 petitions for inclusion in the plebiscite.</a></p>
<p><a id="246" name="246">The process for the petitions encountered several challenges—for example in Zamboanga City, barangay officials who initially signed resolutions for inclusion were allegedly pressured to withdraw their support.</a></p>
<p><a id="247" name="247">Some communities that initiated petitions by getting the signatures of 10% of registered voters, also raised concerns regarding the stringent COMELEC requirements such as the physical presence of the signatories in the COMELEC Headquarters in Manila for the application/hearing.</a></p>
<p><a id="248" name="248">In the end, 28 additional barangays from North Cotobato were allowed to join the plebiscite on 06 February.5  Questions and doubts were raised early on regarding the funding for the conduct of the plebiscite, including the monitoring, information campaign and the voters’ registration.</a></p>
<p><a id="249" name="249">These were eventually adequately resolved with Congress, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM)6, and COMELEC, making assurances that funds will be made available from the current General Appropriations Act, following what was provided for in the BOL.</a></p>
<p><a id="250" name="250">However, the said funding only covered the standard minimum requirements of the COMELEC.  </a></p>
<p><a id="251" name="251">It seems that very little resources were given to OPAPP as well as the BTC to enable them to run a massive information campaign deemed necessary for the informed participation in the plebiscite.   </a></p>
<p><a id="252" name="252">The COMELEC Resolution tasked its Education and Information Division to supervise the conduct of information campaigns on the plebiscite, including sectoral campaigns for indigenous communities, women, youth, religious, professionals, and public and private sector employees, in every barangay, municipality, city, and province where the plebiscite is to be conducted.</a></p>
<p><a id="253" name="253">The resolution also provided that every barangay within the plebiscite areas shall hold at least 1 assembly or “pulong-pulong” during the campaign period, to raise awareness and understanding amongst the voters about the law.</a></p>
<p><a id="254" name="254">There are conflicting reports as to whether or not the said barangay assemblies were in fact held, as well as their sufficiency.  </a></p>
<p><a id="255" name="255">The OPAPP, BTC, and several nongovernmental organisations and individuals also organized their own respective information dissemination campaigns and public advocacies.</a></p>

<p><a id="390" name="390">Security Component In 2017, the GPH held an inter-agency workshop on the Security Aspect of the Normalization Program where major units from the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police were invited to discuss, review and make recommendations on the proposed timelines and processes related to the implementation of the security aspect of the Normalization Program.</a></p>
<p><a id="391" name="391">The Joint Peace and Security Committee (JPSC) was also reconstituted in August 2017 with the appointment of new MILF members who would work with their GPH counterparts.8  From July to September 2017, the JPSC held discussions on their TOR and the Operations Manual for the Joint Peace and Security Teams (JPSTs), who are tasked to maintain peace and order and stability of conflict-affected areas during the transition.</a></p>
<p><a id="392" name="392">On 18 October 2017, the TOR of the JPSC was signed by the JPSC and JNC members in Davao City.</a></p>

<p><a id="395" name="395">The Manual outlines the organizational relationship, tasks and functions, and guidelines for the deployment and activities of the JPSTs comprised of contingents from the AFP, PNP and MILF-BIAF.   </a></p>
<p><a id="396" name="396">From 18-22 September 2017, the JNC Secretariat with representatives from the Coordinating Committee on the Cessation of Hostilities (CCCH) & AHJAG Secretariat and MILF, in coordination with DILG-ARMM and other identified local government units, conducted site visits to proposed deployment areas for the JPSTs in Central and Western Mindanao in order to gather data and determine needs based on security, electricity, and water requirements, transportation and road accessibility, etc.  </a></p>
<p><a id="397" name="397">Further site visits and security assessments were conducted to ensure the viability of constructing JPST posts and the subsequent deployment of teams in prioritized deployment sites.  </a></p>

<p><a id="409" name="409">One of the key programs under the normalization process is the decommissioning of the MILF.</a></p>
<p><a id="410" name="410">Given that the approval of the BOL would trigger the decommissioning of 30% of the MILF-BIAF forces and weapons, there is an expectation that there would be rapid developments on this aspect immediately after the plebiscite.</a></p>
<p><a id="411" name="411">Over the past year, the IDB has been building and strengthening its organizational structure, and it conducted site visits, coordinated with the Panels and the JNC to determine decommissioning requirements, and drafted its proposed operations and timeline for the first phase of the decommissioning process.</a></p>
<p><a id="412" name="412">However, some crucial issues remain unresolved such as whether the MILF should submit a partial or full list of combatants to be decommissioned prior to the first phase of decommissioning, or on the storage and the subsequent arrangements for the MILF weapons that will be handed over to the IDB.    </a></p>
<p><a id="413" name="413">In March 2017, 127 of the 145 decommissioned combatants received complete livelihood assistance from the Department of Agriculture (DA) of Region XII.</a></p>

<p><a id="434" name="434">Some understood that President Aquino had promised housing, even though housing support was not included in the agreed package of assistance.  </a></p>
<p><a id="435" name="435">Overall, there has been some progress on the development of the socio-economic program for the next phase of decommissioning in terms of identifying the sets of interventions to be provided to the decommissioned combatants, processes, and partnerships.</a></p>
<p><a id="436" name="436">However, as this socio-economic program is tied with the actual decommissioning process, any delay or problem in the preparations and implementation in the decommissioning for some of the reasons already discussed above could disrupt the socio-economic aspect and create frustrations among combatants on the ground.</a></p>
<p><a id="437" name="437">Already, the perceived limited gains of the initial 145 decommissioned combatants have raised questions and doubts as to the ability of the GPH to provide immediate peace dividends.  </a></p>

<p><a id="442" name="442">After the reconstitution of the Joint Task Forces on Camps Transformation (JTFCT)10, regular meetings were held during the last quarter of 2017 to set policy guidelines to each of the Task Force Camps in the implementation of programs.</a></p>
<p><a id="443" name="443">The JTFCT in fact formulated its Implementing Guidelines for the implementation of the camps transformation program;</a></p>

<p><a id="445" name="445">In January and February 2018, the JTFCTs, in collaboration with OPAPP and DA, delivered 5 units of Power Tillers with trailer engine and 3 units of Fortune Mechanical Rice Thresher in fulfillment of the remaining agri-enterprise commitments to the 6 MILF Camps.</a></p>
<p><a id="446" name="446">In June 2018, OPAPP also funded several Quick Response Projects in some of the camps such as the construction of water systems and solar driers in Camp Abubakar and Camp Rajamuda and the construction of hanging bridges in Camp Badre.</a></p>
<p><a id="447" name="447">However, these good investments still do not seem to meet the expectations of the local communities.</a></p>

<p><a id="456" name="456">There has also been a lack of progress with regard to the amnesty for the MILF rank-and-file.</a></p>
<p><a id="457" name="457">In particular, the Parties have yet to agree on the parameters for the amnesty, which is a task that should have been completed prior to the ratification of the BOL.</a></p>
<p><a id="458" name="458">One concern is that some of the MILF nominees to the BTA need an amnesty in order to be appointed.</a></p>
<p><a id="459" name="459">The first phase of decommissioning will also encounter difficulties if the MILF commanders and combatants are still facing possible arrest and prosecution.</a></p>
<p><a id="460" name="460">Lastly, there has been little progress when it comes to implementing the key recommendations of the TJRC.  </a></p>
<p><a id="461" name="461">For example, there is still no law or policy providing for the establishment of the National Transition Justice and Reconciliation Commission for the Bangsamoro (NTJRCB).</a></p>
<p><a id="462" name="462">While H.B. No. 5669 had been filed by Rep. Christopher Belmonte that would create such body based on the TJRC recommendations, there is no corresponding Senate version and time has run out for further action in this Congressional Session.</a></p>
<p><a id="463" name="463">In November 2018, however, the Parties were able to meet in Bangkok, Thailand to discuss some possible actions forward on transitional justice and reconciliation with the facilitation of the Independent Working Group on Transitional Justice and Dealing with the Past (IWG-TJ/DwP) and former TJRC Chair Mô Bleeker.  </a></p>

<p><a id="467" name="467">The ceasefire mechanisms also coordinated and accompanied the movements of the MILF-BIAF to ensure adherence to existing ceasefire protocols.  </a></p>
<p><a id="468" name="468">In 2017/18, the ceasefire mechanisms continued to resolve ceasefire-related concerns through the conduct of its field verification and fact-finding inquiry as well as monitor and resolve rido-related cases involving members of the MILF-BIAF.</a></p>
<p><a id="469" name="469">They also conducted peace advocacy programs and briefings on the ceasefire mechanisms and the peace process in various local communities.</a></p>

<p><a id="477" name="477">While the MNLF-Misuari Group maintained its position to support the federalism track in lieu of pursuing amendments to R.A. No. 9054, the MNLF-Jikiri and Sema Group continued its active participation in the BTC work of drafting the BBL, and consequently, pushing for its successful passage in Congress and conducting education and information campaign for the approval of the BOL particularly in MNLF communities.  </a></p>
<p><a id="478" name="478">The GPH and the MNLF Implementing Panels have also met regularly to continue their conversation focusing on socio-economic development of MNLF communities.</a></p>

<p><a id="484" name="484">We firmly believe that silencing the guns, allowing the region’s full potential to be unlocked, and achieving sustainable peace would benefit the Bangsamoro people and the Philippines as a whole.</a></p>
<p><a id="485" name="485">With the enactment of the BOL and its ratification after receiving a majority vote in the plebiscite, a major milestone in the CAB has been achieved, bringing us closer to ending the decades-old conflict in Southern Philippines.  </a></p>
<p><a id="486" name="486">The past year and a half were marked by several positive developments:</a></p>
<p><a id="487" name="487">TPMT FIFTH PUBLIC REPORT  March 2019   
Page 23 of 31  - The process as a whole remains strong and the trust and confidence between the GPH and the MILF have grown.</a></p>
<p><a id="488" name="488">As partners, the Office of the President, Congress and the MILF worked together to come up with a legislation that reflects key provisions in the CAB and is in concert w</a></p>

<p><a id="490" name="490">The continued commitment to the peace process by the President, and his strong support for the BOL bolstered by congressional support and engagement, greatly enhanced public optimism and acceptance;</a></p>
<p><a id="491" name="491"> </a></p>
<p><a id="492" name="492">- The fast-tracking of the legislative process for the Organic Law by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, with the President repeatedly emphasizing its priority status and subsequently certifying the bill as urgent, ensured that the MILF-led BTA will have sufficient time - over 3 years from February 2019 to June 2022 - to hopefully build the foundations of a stronger and more autonomous regional government in the Bangsamoro;</a></p>
<p><a id="493" name="493"> </a></p>
<p><a id="494" name="494">- The successful conduct of the plebiscite was a major step forward, and we note that both Parties have maintained since the outset of negotiations in 1997 that the will of the people affected by these changes must be the final assessment of the peace process. .</a></p>
<p><a id="495" name="495">This was also the first election of any sort in the ARMM to be completed without failure of elections in any portion of the region.</a></p>
<p><a id="496" name="496">COMELEC fulfilled its responsibilities in enabling as many people as possible from the Bangsamoro core territories and surrounding areas to take part in the plebiscite and exercise their right to vote, and the end result was a mostly peaceful and free and fair plebiscite;</a></p>

<p><a id="498" name="498">Under normalization, preparations for both the security component and MILF decommissioning process are progressing.</a></p>

<p><a id="501" name="501">At the same time, there have also been setbacks and challenges in other areas of the peace process.</a></p>

<p><a id="513" name="513">With the heavy focus on the BOL and the plebiscite, there was relatively little progress in the preparations for the transition.</a></p>
<p><a id="514" name="514">However, with the ratification of the BOL in the plebiscite, there is an expectation that the BTA will hit the ground running, managing a smooth transition from the ARMM to the new Bangsamoro Government while ensuring that there will be no interruption in the delivery of basic social services;</a></p>
<p><a id="515" name="515">-</a></p>
<p><a id="516" name="516">There have been significant delays in several aspects of the normalization track.</a></p>
<p><a id="517" name="517">The Parties have yet to reach consensus on 1) the issue of the carrying of the firearms of the MILF members of the JPSTs;</a></p>
<p><a id="518" name="518">2) the submission of the MILF list of combatants to be decommissioned;</a></p>

<p><a id="522" name="522">and 6) the parameters for the amnesty program for MILF combatants;</a></p>
<p><a id="523" name="523">and - Transitional justice was a core element of the peace negotiations, and is a cornerstone of the CAB;</a></p>
<p><a id="524" name="524">however, there has been little progress on fundamental measures to address transitional justice issues.</a></p>
<p><a id="525" name="525">The final version of the BOL included provisions on transitional justice, though it essentially transfers responsibility for addressing historical injustices from the national government to the Bangsamoro.</a></p>
<p><a id="526" name="526">This is a major deviation from the CAB, and at this point it is unclear whether the transitional justice concerns as outlined in the CAB can be adequately resolved within the powers of the new regional government.   </a></p>
<p><a id="527" name="527">Despite these challenges, we hold fast to our view expressed in previous reports that the Parties’ continuing strong commitment to the peace process serves as the best guarantee of success.</a></p>
<p><a id="528" name="528">For the next phase of the peace process, now that the BARMM is established and with the BTA in place, the TPMT is of the view that it will be imperative for the Parties to:</a></p>
<p><a id="529" name="529">-</a></p>
<p><a id="530" name="530">Discuss and agree on the way forward so that the CAB provisions that have been deleted or amended in the BOL may still be implemented.</a></p>
<p><a id="531" name="531">For example, the BTC was tasked to recommend possible amendments to the Constitution (Annex on Transitional Arrangements and Modalities, Section 1, Clause D).</a></p>
<p><a id="532" name="532">There is then a need to clarify the timeframe and the process on how these recommendations will be translated to a piece of legislation, whether it shall be done as part of the federalism project or a separate set of constitutional amendments;</a></p>

<p><a id="550" name="550">The circumstances and roots of these events, including the recent bombing of the Jolo Cathedral and the mosque in Zamboanga City, should also be intensively researched, in order to develop programs that will holistically and proactively prevent violent extremism.</a></p>
