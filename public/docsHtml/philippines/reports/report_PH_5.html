<p><a id="1" name="1">Background  
 
The independent Third -Party Monitoring Team (TPMT) was set up by the Government of the 
Philippines (GPH) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) to monitor t</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">he 
implementation of the GPH -MILF</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">peace agreement, as provided for  in the Framework 
Agreement on the Bangsamoro (FAB) signed on 15 October 2012.</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">The Terms of Reference 
(ToR) of the TPMT were agreed between the Parties on 25 January 2013, its members were 
appointed during the following months, and it had its inaugural meeting in Kuala Lumpur 
from 08 to 11 July 2013, alongside  the 38th Exploratory Talks between the Parties.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">The TPMT has five members – two representatives from Philippine NGOs  and two 
represen tatives from international NGOs (one of each being nominated  by each Party , all 
being agreed by both Parties ), and one “eminent international person” (jointly nominated by 
the two Parties) to act as Chair, convenor and spokesperson of the TPMT.</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">The local m embers 
are Karen Tañada (Gaston Z Ortigas Peace Institute) and Z ainudin  Malang (Mindanao Human 
Rights Action Centre), the international members are Huseyin</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">Oru ç (IHH) and Steve n Rood 
(The Asia Foundation), and the Chair is Alistair MacDonald (former EU Amb assador to the 
Philippines, now retired).</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">Brief CVs of the TPMT members are given in Annex I.  
 
</a></p>

and assessing the implementation of all signed agreements between th e Parties, primarily the 
FAB and its Annexes.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">In particular, its basic functions are to :</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">- monitor and evaluate the implementation of all agreements;</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13"> 
- review and assess the progress of the implementation of commitments by both Parties 
under the Agreement s (submitting comprehensive periodic reports and updates to both 
Parties for their appropriate action);</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14"> 
- and to communicate to the public the progress and developments in the implementation of 
the Agreements of the Parties.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">It should be noted however tha t the TPMT is not the only monitoring body associated with the 
peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">The International Monitoring Team (IMT) has since 2004 been charged with 
monitoring the implementation of the 1997 ceasefire, while certain other bodies are being set 
up for spec ific monitoring tasks</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">.1 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">The ToR require that the TPMT shall work on the basis of consensus and in a spirit of 
cooperation, confidence -building and trust.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">The TPMT shall have access to all reports and 
activities connected to the implementation of the agree ments, and shall be allowed to observe 
the meetings of the Transition Commission and other bodies concerned with the 
implementation of the Agreements.  
                                                 
</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">1  </a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">For exam ple, the Annex on Transitional Modalities foresees the establishment of a robust international -
domestic monitoring body, accredited by COMELEC.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">to monitor the administration of the plebiscite, while 
the Annex on Normalisation foresees the establishment of an Independent Decommissioning Body to 
oversee the process of decommissioning of MILF forces and weapons.  </a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">2  
 
The TPMT shall convene every two months and as they deem necessary, through until the  
regular operati on of the Bangsamoro Government  from the second semester of 2016.2 At that 
point, the GPH and MILF Panels, together with the Malaysian Facilitator and the TPMT, shall 
meet to review the implementation of all agreements and the progress of the transition.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">A n 
“Exit Document” officially terminating the peace negotiations may be crafted and signed by 
both Parties if and only when all agreements have been fully implemented.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">In addition to providing confidential written reports to the Panel chairs and the Malays ian 
facilitator, quarterly and as necessary, the TPMT is obliged to produce a public written report 
yearly or as it deems necessary, providing an overall assessment of developments in the 
implementation of the Agreements.3 The present report is the first s uch public report produced 
by the TPMT, covering the period from its inception in  July through to January 2014.  
 
 
2)  TPMT activities July  2013 - January 2014 
 
After its launch meeting in Kuala Lumpur in July 2013, the TPMT convened twice in the 
Philippin es, from 23 -28 September and 03 to 07 December.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">These meetings allowed TPMT 
members to begin consultations with a large number of stakeholders in the peace process.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">During the September meeting (coming shortly after the 40th Exploratory Talks in Kuala 
Lum pur) the TPMT met with Secretary Deles in Manila and Chairman Murad in Camp 
Darapanan , with the GPH and MILF Panel Chairs, with members of the Transition 
Commission, with civil society in Manila and Cotabato City, with Archbishop (now Cardinal) 
Quevedo of the Diocese of Cotabato, with the International Monitoring Team  and with 
International Contact Group  members.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">A short press release was issued at the close of this 
visit.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">The December meeting coincided with the 42nd Exploratory Talks in Kuala Lumpur, but it 
was nevertheless possible for the TPMT to carry out consultations both in Manila (notably 
with members of the Independent Commission on Policing and with several Members of 
Congress  interested in the peace process), as well as meeting with Secretary Del es, and in 
Zamboanga (notably with members from senior leadership positions in the MNLF, with 
Muslim religious leaders and with civil society).</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">TPMT members were also able to meet with 
the GPH and MILF Panel Chairs before or after the 42nd Exploratory Talk s. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">The TPMT has also been able to make progress in establishing its internal rules and 
regulations.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">The TPMT Code of Conduct was submitted for the agreement of the Panels on 11 
December 2013, together with the TPMT’s draft Workplan for 2014.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">The TPMT’s fi rst 
confidential report was presented to the Panels on 27 December, covering the entire period 
from July to December 2013, and including a number of observations and recommendations.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The present report, the TPMT’s first Public Report, was finalised during January 2014.  
                                                 
</a></p>

<p><a id="37" name="37">The FAB provides for the appointment of the Bangsamoro Government by the Bangsamoro Assembly to be 
elected in May 2016.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">Once the Basic Law has been  ratified (and until the entry into office of the 
Bangsamoro Government), the executive body of the Bangsamoro shall be a Bangsamoro Transition 
Authority, appointed by the President.

<p><a id="39" name="39">While a draft of the public report is presented to the GPH and MILF Pa nels for comment, the TPMT has the 
final say on the content of the report as published.  </a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">3  
Financial support for TPMT activities during 2013 was provided by the Governments of 
Norway and the United Kingdom, as well as by the non -governmental organisations involved. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">During December 2013, the European Union committed funds to cover the operational costs 
of the TPMT (via a contract with UNDP) for an initial period from January 2014 to June 
2015.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">It may be noted that all TPMT members are providing their services free of charge, 
with external finance covering covering only travel, acco mmodation, perdiem and other 
operational costs (including modest institutional support to the home organisati ons of the two 
local members of the TPMT ).</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43"> 
 
 
3)  </a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">Key developments in the implementation of Agreements  
 
At the time of the TPMT’s inaugural meeting in July of 2013, only one of the four Annexes to 
the FAB had so far been signed – the Annex on Transitional Arrangements and Modalities, 
signed on 27 February 2013.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">Since then, several key steps have been taken towards completing the comprehensive peace 
agreement :</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46"> 
- the Annex on Revenue Generation and Wealth Sharing was signed on 13 July 2013, at the 
close of the 38th Exploratory Talks ;</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">
</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">- the Annex on Power Sharing was signed on 08 December 2013, at the close of the 42nd 
Exploratory Talks ;</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">
</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">- and the Annex  on Normalisation (together with the addendum on Bangsamoro Waters), 
was signed on 25 January 2014, at the close of the 43rd Exploratory Talks . 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Meanwhile, important steps have been taken in implementing agreements already signed :</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">- following its launch i n April of 2013, the Transition Commission (TC) has met on a 
number of occasions to pursue its basic mandate of drafting the Basic Law, has set up a 
number of technical committees ,4 carried out a number of public consultations, and 
entered into MoAs with a  number of local and international NGOs to assist it in these 
tasks;</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54"> 
- the Independent Commission on Policing (ICP) was launched in September 2013, on the 
margins of the 40th Exploratory Talks, and commenced its work in the Philippines on 14 
October.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55"> 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">In addition, preliminary steps have been taken by GPH in relation to the development aspects 
of the FAB, with the establishment in February 2013 of a Task Force on Bangsamoro 
Development, and the launching that same month of the “Sajahatra Bangsamoro” program,  
providing in coordination with the Transition Commission the government’s initial support 
for identified MILF combatants, families and other affected persons and communities.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">As of 
December 2013 this programme had already undertaken a number of actions in  the fields of 
health, education and livelihood in 10 municipalities, while community -based assessment and 
planning activities are underway.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58"> 
 
 
 
                                                 
4  Seven technical committees have been foreseen at this point, covering fiscal autonomy, justice and security, 
political autonomy, basic rights, transitory provisions,  and constitutional amendments, together with a 
coordinating committee.  </a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">4  
 
4)  </a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">Other observations  
 
With the  last of the four annexes to the FAB completed only in late January 2014 , there is not 
a great deal that can be said at this stage about the implementation of the agreements. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">Nevertheless, there were several key observations which the TPMT was able to draw from the 
consultations which it undertook during September and December.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">Notwithstanding the delay in completing the comprehensive peace agreement (originally 
foreseen to be completed by end -2012), it was evident that both Parties continue d throughout  
to share the strongest commitment to peace , and are absolutely determined to br ing the 
process to a successful conclusion.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">The successful completion of the four Annexes to the FAB 
confirms this, and the stage is now set for full implementation of the signed agreements and 
for an intensification in the momentum of the process.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">That s aid, there was a strong recognition among all to whom the TPMT spoke of the “need 
for speed” , and for the drafting of the Basic Law to be completed as soon as possible .</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">This 
point was underlined in particular by the Members of the House of Representatives whom we 
met, who were concerned to commence consideration of the Basic Law at the earliest 
opportunity .</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">But the same point was made by all those we met in Manila, Cotabato and 
Zamboanga, many of whom had emphasised the importance for public opinion and awa reness 
of being able to see the comprehensive agreement in its entirety.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">The signature in January of 
the Annex on  Normalisation (and of the addendum on Bangsamoro Waters) was thus of 
crucial importance .  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">Many stakeholders underlined the need for deeper pu blic information  about the FAB and its 
implications.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">This desire was evident in Manila and in Cotabato, but was even stronger in 
Zamboanga and among stakeholders from Basilan, Sulu and Tawi -Tawi.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">It was encouraging 
that both civil society and religious lea ders (whether Christian or Muslim) were keen to help 
support information efforts, but they recognised themselves that they needed to have a better 
understanding of what the implementation of the agreement will mean for the Bangsamoro as 
a whole.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">It was als o suggested that it would be important for the Parties to strengthen their 
outreach and public messaging to a wider audience, including for example local government 
units , the ulama and the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines , civil society mor e 
generally, and the private sector and chambers of commerce.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">Perhaps linked to this expressed need for greater information, it was evident that some 
interlocutors were concerned about the inclusiveness of the process .</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">Indeed, it seemed that 
there may be a significant scope for misunderstanding about the implications of the FAB, its 
relationship with the 1996 Final Peace Agreement with the MNLF, and the likely tenor of the 
future Bangsamoro assembly and government.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">There was also a clear desire among many of 
our interlocutors to see the FAB as something which would be beneficial for all Bangsamoro, 
and not only for one or other Bangsamoro group.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">It will be important therefore for both 
Parties to do more to underline the inclusiveness of the process, no less  for Western Mindanao 
than for Central Mindanao

5)  </a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">Concluding remarks  
 
The TPMT’s consultations in September and December with stakeholders in Cotabato City, in 
Zamboanga and in Manila confirmed the tremendous importance which all attached to 
achievi ng a comprehensive, inclusive and sustainable peace in Mindanao, a peace which 
would bring an end to cycles of violence and displacement, and which would allow the 
tremendous economic, social and cultural potential of Mindanao to come to the fore.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">The 
tragic events of September 2013 in Zamboanga only underscored the importance of achieving 
this.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">The two Panels are to be congratulated on completing all four Annexes to the FAB.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">Looking 
forward – to the signature of the comprehensive peace agreement,  the drafting and adoption of 
the Basic Law, and the full implementation of the agreements reached  – one can clearly see 
the construction of a lasting peace . 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">The members of the TPMT are honoured to have been given the opportunity to play a small 
part in contributi ng to this process.</a></p>
