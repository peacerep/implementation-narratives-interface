<p><a id="1" name="1">Preface 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">This report was drafted i n mid-January 2015, wit h some factual updating thereafter. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">As a result, it does not ad dress the tragic events at  Mamasapano on 25 Janu ary – and 
indeed it would be inapp ropriate to make any sub stantive comment on the se events 
before the facts of the m atter have been satisfacto rily established, includin g through 
the several investigations  now being carried out –  by the Government and  the PNP 
Board of Inquiry, by the M ILF, and by the Internatio nal Monitoring Team. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">We understand that this  incident led to the de aths of 44 Special Act ion Force 
personnel, 18 MILF com batants, and 4 civilians, and as TPMT we would  join all 
those who have expressed  their condolences to the families of the victims.</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">There is no doubt that thi s has been the greatest ch allenge which the peace p rocess has 
faced in recent years (ce rtainly since the signatur e of the Framework Agr eement on 
the Bangsamoro in Octob er of 2012).</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">It is inevitab le that emotions run high , and that 
trust in the process has b een reduced .</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">This will c ertainly have an impact a lso on the 
time-table for the remain ing stages of the process,  tightening further what w as already 
a very demanding schedu le. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">Nevertheless, we have be en encouraged by the rei terated commitment to ac hieving a 
lasting peace which has  been expressed by bo th Parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">In President Aquino’s 
addresses to the nation o n 28 January and 6 Febru ary he had noted the imp ortance of 
pursuing peace with gre ater determination, and underlined the primary goal of a 
widespread and lasting p eace, creating a better f uture for coming genera tions, and 
attaining justice through  solidarity and partners hip.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">MILF Chair Al H aj Murad 
Ebrahim reiterated in his own statement of 27 Janu ary the MILF’s full comm itment to 
the primary objective of a n enduring peace and just ice.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">Many other political figu res and opinion-leaders in  Manila and in Mindanao  have also 
called for sobriety and p artnership in learning the  lessons of this sad even t, working 
even harder to create an environment of peace and  security in which such a n incident 
could not be repeated.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">A nd as TPMT we would join our voice in suppor t of that 
critical objective.  </a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">Our c riterion is the full implem entation of all signed ag reements, 
particularly the Framewo rk Agreement on the Ban gsamoro and its Annexes , and we 
continue to focus on that.  
 
  </a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">2 Third-Party Monitoring  Team 
Second Public Report, J anuary 2014 to January  2015 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">Summary 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">In line with the terms of  reference of the Third-P arty Monitoring Team, t his second public 
report is intended to prov ide an overall assessment  of developments in the i mplementation of 
the Agreements between  the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and t he Moro Islamic 
Liberation Front, and pri marily of the implement ation of the Framework Agreement on the 
Bangsamoro (FAB) and i ts Annexes. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">2014 saw several key mil estones in the peace proc ess, including in particula r the signature of 
the Comprehensive Ag reement on the Bangs amoro (CAB) on 27 March, the joint 
submission of the dra ft of the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) to Congress o n 10 
September, and the lau nching immediately the reafter of the extensive Congression al 
consultations and delibe rations on the BBL. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">Based on our review of th e draft BBL, it would app ear that the draft fully respects the t erms 
of the CAB (with one trivial exceptio n), and indeed clarifies a number of issues – addre ssing 
certain areas which had n ot been so clearly expres sed in the CAB (for exam ple in relation to 
consonance with the Con stitution, to the general su pervision of the President , to human rights, 
or to the Bangsamoro Po lice being clearly part of the PNP) – and adding so me new elements 
which the Parties believ ed could improve on the  arrangements proposed in the CAB (for 
example the establishmen t of the office of the Wal i, or the provision for cre ating an office or 
ministry for indigenous p eoples within the Bangsam oro Government). 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">In addition to these majo r events, work has continued on  all the other dimension s of the 
agreements :</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">
</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">- initial progress has  been made in the normalisation track, with the establishm ent of the 
three major normalisatio n bodies -  the Joint N ormalisation Committee (JNC), the 
Transitional Justice and  Reconciliation Commit tee (TJRC), and most r ecently the 
Independent Decommissi oning Board (IDB) – and  with the submission in A pril of the 
report of the Independent  Commission on Policing  (ICP).</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">This key element of the peace 
process is difficult and sensitive, and has been carried forward more sl owly than 
expected. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">- preparations contin ue for the first ceremon ial turnover of crew-ser ved weapons and 
high-powered firearms by the BIAF to the ID B – the first of four phases of 
decommissioning of MI LF forces – and it is to  be hoped that this will  be carried 
forward without further s erious delay;</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">
</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">- regarding socio-economic develop ment, a substantial range of activities under the 
Sajahatra Bangsamoro pr ogram have been carried out (though progress has been slower 
than initially expected, a nd program implementat ion has been extended).</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">In a longer-
term perspective, a deta iled Bangsamoro Devel opment Plan was prese nted to the 
President, to the MILF and to the international  community in Novemb er, already 
leading to a pledge of su bstantial development fu nding from the Governm ent to allow 
the Bangsamoro to begin the process of catching up  with the rest of the count ry;</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">
</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">- preparations for th e transition from ARMM to BTA ha ve also been carried forw ard, 
for example with respe ct to initial preparation s for the plebiscite, an d with the 
establishment of a coordi nation team for the transi tion bringing together GP H, ARMM 
and the MILF.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">In additio n, the MILF have establi shed the United Bangsam oro Justice 
Party (UBJP), marking a  significant transition fro</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">m armed struggle to full engagement 
with the political process.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32"> 
  3 Against that background , we believe that considerable progress was achieved in 2014 – 
whether in the process as  a whole, in the normalisa tion track, or in relation t o socio-economic 
development planning.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">Of course progress was n ot as rapid as either Party  would have wished, and delays have been 
encountered in a numb er of areas – with respect to the co mpletion of the draft BB L, to 
certain aspects of the n ormalisation track, or to  the implementation of socio-economic 
programs (particularly in  relation to infrastructure ).</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">It has always been clea r that 45 years of 
armed conflict can not be  ended quickly or easily.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">The devil will always be in the details, and 
the best guarantee of succ ess will always be the str ongest underlying commi tment to peace by 
both Parties, amply demo nstrated during 2014. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">The biggest test of this co mmitment, certainly since  the Framework Agreeme nt was signed in 
October 2012, came with  the tragic events of 25 Janu ary at Mamasapano.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">As noted above, 
it would be inappropriate  to make any substantive  comment on these event s before the facts 
of the matter have been s atisfactorily established, i ncluding through the seve ral investigations 
now being carried out – b y the Government and the  PNP Board of Inquiry, b y the MILF, and 
by the International Moni toring Team. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">Looking forward, multiple challenges had  already existed, for example with regard  to :</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">
</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">- the timely adoption of the BBL (in a form compliant w ith the agreements and n ot 
subject to major challeng es in the Supreme Court);</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42"> 
- the successful conduct of th e plebiscite to determin e the effectivity and geo graphic 
coverage of the Bangsam oro (which will call for a ma ssive communications eff ort by 
both Parties);</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">
</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">- ensuring a smooth transition from  ARMM to BTA, and addressing the cha llenges 
arising from the much sh orter-than-expected trans ition period now foreseen  before the 
regular elections in May 2 016;</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">
</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">- moving forward wi th comprehensive and tim ely efforts in relation to a ll dimensions of 
normalisation, as containe d in the matrix attached to  the Annex on Normaliza tion. 
- ensuring the nec essary support for socio-ec onomic development, from the 
Government and the in ternational community, in order to permit “cat ch-up” (and 
ensuring rapid and effecti ve delivery, drawing on t he lessons from the past);</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47"> 
- and achieving the greatest possible sense of inclusivity, among all the inhabitan ts of 
the Bangsamoro, whethe r Muslim, Lumad or C hristian, MILF or MNL F, or from 
mainland or island comm unities.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">And now, since 25 January, most of these pre-existing cha llenges will become even  more 
acute.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">Emotions run high, and  confidence in the proces s (on both sides) has tak en a knock. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Both houses of Congress  have suspended action on the draft Bangsamoro  Basic Law until 
investigations have clarif ied the events of that day .  </a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">This will certainly have  an impact on the 
time-table for the remain ing stages of the process , and may also colour th e final discussions 
on the BBL in Congress , as well as influencing t he climate of opinion in the run-up to the 
plebiscite.  </a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">After a previo us incident, in October 2 011 in Al Barka, Basilan , the peace panels 
of both parties continued  to meet while investigat ions were on-going;</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">how ever the fact that 
the draft BBL has been  filed in Congress has opened the entire proce ss to public and 
sometimes emotional deb ate. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">But while the challenges are great, the  prizes to be gained are even greater.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">There is a real 
prospect that the peace p rocess will allow the regi on  to achieve the full po tential offered by 
its human and natural r esources and to contribu te more effectively to th e prosperity and 
security of the nation a s a whole, and that the  vision of autonomy se t out in the 1987 
Constitution will be im plemented in a manner  consistent with the as pirations of the 
Bangsamoro people while  respecting the rights of a ll of the region’s inhabita nts.  
  4 The best guarantees of success are the continuing comm itment to peace of both P arties at the 
highest level, the massive  engagement of Congress  and the public in deliber ating on the BBL, 
and the underlying hopes  of the people of Mindan ao for a peaceful and pro sperous future for 
their children. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">1) TPMT mandate, m embers and activities  
 
The Third-Party Monitor ing Team (TPMT) was e stablished in July 2013, as foreseen in the 
respective provisions of the Framework Agreeme nt on the Bangsamoro a nd its Annex on 
Transitional Arrangemen ts and Modalities, and in  line with the Terms of Reference of the 
TPMT agreed by the Pan els on 25 January 20131 (Annex I).</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">The mandate of the TPMT is to monitor, review and  assess the implementatio n of all signed 
agreements between the Parties, primarily the FA B and its Annexes2.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">The TPMT is required 
to report :</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">
</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">- to the Panel Chairs , in confidence, on a quar terly basis, providing our  observations and 
recommendations.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">The Pa nels are not bound by our  recommendations, but sh all provide 
written responses within o ne month;</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">
</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">- to the public, on a yearly basis or as the TPM T deems necessary, provi ding our overall 
assessment of developm ents in the implementati on of the agreements.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">T hese public 
reports are provided to th e Panels and the Facilitat or for comment and cons ultation, but 
the TPMT has the final sa y on the content of the rep ort.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">Our ToR require that the TPMT shall convene eve ry two months, through u ntil the end of the 
transition period and th e regular operation of the Bangsamoro Govern ment (to occur 
following the first electi ons to the Bangsamoro P arliament, expected to ta ke place in May 
2016).</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">At that point, th e two Panels, together with the Facilitator and the TPMT, shall 
convene a meeting to re view the implementation  of all agreements and th e progress of the 
transition, and produce a n “Exit Document” offici ally terminating the proc ess.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">The ToR also 
note that the TPMT sh all work on the basis of consensus, in a spir it of cooperation, 
confidence-building and trust, shall have access to  all reports and activities  connected to the 
implementation of the ag reements, and shall be all owed to observe the mee tings of all bodies 
concerned with the imp lementation of the agre ements.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">The TPMT’s In ternal Rules and 
Regulations (workplan, code of conduct, securi ty protocols, financial p rocedures) were 
submitted to and approve d by the Panels between D ecember 2013 and April 2 014. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">The TPMT has five m embers – two representatives from Philippine NGOs and two 
representatives from inte rnational NGOs (one of each being nominated b y each Party, all 
being agreed by the two Parties), and one “emine nt international person” ( jointly nominated 
by the two Parties).</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">The l ocal members are Karen Tañada (Gaston Z. Ortiga s Peace Institute) 
and Rahib Kudto (UNYP AD), the international me mbers are Huseyin Oruç (IHH) and Steven 
Rood (The Asia Foundati on), and the Chair is Alis tair MacDonald (former E U Ambassador to 
the Philippines, now retir ed).</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">Brief CVs of the TPM T members are given in A nnex II.  
 
                                                
</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">1  The TPMT ToR estab lished in January 2013 w ere slightly augmented in  January 2014, when the 
Annex on Normalization provided that “consistent  with its functions, the TP MT shall monitor the 
aspects of the redeployme nt of AFP units and troop s”. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">2  </a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">It should be noted th at the TPMT is not  the only monitoring bo dy associated with the p eace 
process.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">The Internationa l Monitoring Team (IMT ) has since 2004 been ch arged with monitoring 
the implementation of t he 1997 ceasefire, and the Independent Decom missioning Body was 
established in 2014 to ov ersee the process of deco mmissioning of MILF fo rces and weapons.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">In 
addition, it is foreseen th at a separate domestic-int ernational monitoring bod y shall be established 
to monitor the administra tion of the plebiscite on th e BBL.  </a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">5 Following its inaugural m eeting in Kuala Lumpur i n July 2013, alongside th e 38th Exploratory 
Talks between the Partie s, the TPMT convened twice  during 2013, in September and in 
December, and on seven occasions since then, in February, April, June , September, October 
and December 2014, and most recently in February  20153.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80"> 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">During these sessions, th e TPMT has met regular ly with both Panels and with other bodies 
associated with the peace  process, with senior figu res of the Government a nd of the MILF, 
with members of Cong ress and local governm ent executives, AFP, P NP and BIAF 
commanders, civil socie ty organisations, religiou s leaders, and with repr esentatives of the 
private sector and academ e.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">In addition to meeting s in Manila and in Darap anan, the TPMT 
has met with key stakeh olders in all of the areas  of the Core Territory o f</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">the Bangsamoro 
(Maguindanao, Lanao del  Sur, Basilan, Sulu, Tawi  Tawi, Cotabato and Isab ela Cities), as well 
as in areas neighbouring  the Bangsamoro (Alabe l, Davao, General Santos  City, Iligan City, 
Kidapawan, Koronadal, and Zamboanga City).</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">A  calendar of TPMT sess ions is given in

<p><a id="85" name="85">Financial support for T PMT activities during 2014 (and the fi rst semester of 2015)</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">ha s 
been provided by the Eu ropean Union, through a  grant-contract administe red by UNDP.  </a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">It 
may be noted that all T PMT members are prov iding their services free  of charge, with 
external finance covering  only travel, accommoda tion, perdiem and other operational costs 
(including modest institut ional support to the home  organisations of the two local members of 
the TPMT, which also p ermitted these organisati ons to carry out further consultations and 
research activities with k ey stakeholder groups in  Mindanao and Manila - - summary details 
are given in Annex IV). 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">In line with our ToR, thi s second TPMT Public R eport, covering the period fro m January

the signature of the Compr ehensive Agreeement on  the Bangsamoro (CAB) on 27 March 
at the Malacañan.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">The CAB was signed by P anel Chairs Miriam Co ronel-Ferrer and

February 2013), on Weal th-Sharing (13 July 2013 ), and on Power-Sharing (08 August 2013).</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">The 
Annex on Normalisation (and its associated “Norm alisation Matrix”), togeth er with the Addendum 
on Bangsamoro Waters, were signed on 25 Janua ry 2014.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">The Comprehen sive Agreement on the 
Bangsamoro thus include s the FAB and its annexes , as well as six preparator y agreements between 
the two Parties, starting w ith the original agreement  on cessation of hostilities  of 18 July 1997.  </a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">6 Already since its launch ing in April 2013, the B angsamoro Transition Co mmission (BTC) 
had been working to prep are the draft Bangsamoro  Basic Law (BBL), which  once adopted by 
Congress would transfor m the agreements betwe en the Parties into the l egal basis for the 
establishment of the Bang samoro.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">At the request of  President Aquino, the BT C accelerated its 
work following the signa ture of the CAB, and a fi rst (partial) draft of the B BL was presented 
to the Office of the Presid ent on 14 April, followed  by the complete draft on  22 April.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">This draft BBL was then  reviewed in detail by th e Office of the President , with a view to 
ensuring the draft would be fully in line with the C onstitution.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">This process took longer than 
expected, and discussion s on the draft continued  through till September, Throughout these 
discussions, however diff icult, it was clear that bo th Parties remained fully committed, at the 
highest level, to the su ccessful completion of the process.</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">This was c onfirmed by the 
engagement of Executive  Secretary Ochoa during August, and indeed by th e final high-level 
discussions between Pres ident Aquino and Centra l Committee Chair Al Ha j Murad Ebrahim 
in early September.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106"> 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">The result was that the final draft of the BBL w as submitted to Congre ss by the BTC on 
10 September, in a ceremony at the Malacañan with the pre sence of President Aqui no, 
Senate President Drilon a nd House Speaker Belmo nte.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">The lengthy discussions b etween BTC and the Offi ce of the President, runni ng from late April 
through till early Septem ber, undoubtedly caused concern – and also impa cted on the time-
line of the process, fro m Congressional delibe ration through to the p lebiscite and the 
launching of the Bangsam oro Transition Authority.  </a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">We believe however tha t the outcome of 
these discussions, in term s of a Bill to which both Parties are fully committ ed, and which the 
Government and the BT C firmly believe is ent irely in line with the C onstitution, was 
extremely important for t he longterm success of th e process.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">We have reviewed the f inal text of the draft BB L in detail, and believe that the Bill as 
submitted to Congress is fully in line with th e CAB, and indeed in certain respects 
improves on the CAB (for example by clarifyin g certain points which m ight otherwise have 
led to questions of constit utionality) :</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">
</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">- all elements of the agreements set out in the CAB are fully reflected in  the draft BBL as

<p><a id="338" name="338">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="339" name="339">And now, since 25 January, most o f these pre-existing chal lenges will be even more  acute. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="340" name="340">Emotions run high, and confidence in the proces s (on both sides) must b e restored before

<p><a id="343" name="343">But these great challenge s must be seen in the conte xt of the enormous opportun ities which 
peace can bring, in terms of achieving a sustainable peace, of imp roving governance and th e

of all of the region’s inha bitants.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="345" name="345">And the best guarantees o f success in this endeavour are offered by the continui ng 
commitment of both Pa rties, at the highest leve l, to achieving a sustain ed peace, by the

<p><a id="402" name="402">The Terms of Reference 
(ToR) of the TPMT were agreed between the Parties on 25 January 2013, its members were 
appointed during the following months, and it had its inaugural meeting in Kuala Lumpur 
from 08 to 11 July 2013, alongside  the 38th Exploratory Talks between the Parties.

Philippin es, from 23 -28 September and 03 to 07 December.</a></p>
<p><a id="424" name="424">These meetings allowed TPMT 
members to begin consultations with a large number of stakeholders in the peace process.

was nevertheless possible for the TPMT to carry out consultations both in Manila (notably 
with members of the Independent Commission on Policing and with several Members of 
Congress  interested in the peace process), as well as meeting with Secretary Del es, and in 
Zamboanga (notably with members from senior leadership positions in the MNLF, with

operational costs (including modest institutional support to the home organisati ons of the two 
local members of the TPMT ).</a></p>

the FAB had so far been signed – the Annex on Transitional Arrangements and Modalities, 
signed on 27 February 2013.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="443" name="443">Since then, several key steps have been taken towards completing the comprehensive peace 
agreement :</a></p>
<p><a id="444" name="444"> 
- the Annex on Revenue Generation and Wealth Sharing was signed on 13 July 2013, at the 
close of the 38th Exploratory Talks ;</a></p>

was signed on 25 January 2014, at the close of the 43rd Exploratory Talks . 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="449" name="449">Meanwhile, important steps have been taken in implementing agreements already signed :</a></p>
<p><a id="450" name="450"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="451" name="451">- following its launch i n April of 2013, the Transition Commission (TC) has met on a 
number of occasions to pursue its basic mandate of drafting the Basic Law, has set up a 
number of technical committees ,4 carried out a number of public consultations, and 
entered into MoAs with a  number of local and international NGOs to assist it in these 
tasks;</a></p>
<p><a id="452" name="452"> 
- the Independent Commission on Policing (ICP) was launched in September 2013, on the 
margins of the 40th Exploratory Talks, and commenced its work in the Philippines on 14 
October.</a></p>
<p><a id="453" name="453"> 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="454" name="454">In addition, preliminary steps have been taken by GPH in relation to the development aspects 
of the FAB, with the establishment in February 2013 of a Task Force on Bangsamoro 
Development, and the launching that same month of the “Sajahatra Bangsamoro” program,  
providing in coordination with the Transition Commission the government’s initial support 
for identified MILF combatants, families and other affected persons and communities.</a></p>
<p><a id="455" name="455">As of 
December 2013 this programme had already undertaken a number of actions in  the fields of

<p><a id="458" name="458">Other observations  
 
With the  last of the four annexes to the FAB completed only in late January 2014 , there is not 
a great deal that can be said at this stage about the implementation of the agreements. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="459" name="459">Nevertheless, there were several key observations which the TPMT was able to draw from the 
consultations which it undertook during September and December.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="460" name="460">Notwithstanding the delay in completing the comprehensive peace agreement (originally 
foreseen to be completed by end -2012), it was evident that both Parties continue d throughout  
to share the strongest commitment to peace , and are absolutely determined to br ing the 
process to a successful conclusion.</a></p>
<p><a id="461" name="461">The successful completion of the four Annexes to the FAB 
confirms this, and the stage is now set for full implementation of the signed agreements and 
for an intensification in the momentum of the process.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="462" name="462">That s aid, there was a strong recognition among all to whom the TPMT spoke of the “need 
for speed” , and for the drafting of the Basic Law to be completed as soon as possible .</a></p>
<p><a id="463" name="463">This 
point was underlined in particular by the Members of the House of Representatives whom we 
met, who were concerned to commence consideration of the Basic Law at the earliest 
opportunity .</a></p>
<p><a id="464" name="464">But the same point was made by all those we met in Manila, Cotabato and 
Zamboanga, many of whom had emphasised the importance for public opinion and awa reness 
of being able to see the comprehensive agreement in its entirety.</a></p>
<p><a id="465" name="465">The signature in January of 
the Annex on  Normalisation (and of the addendum on Bangsamoro Waters) was thus of 
crucial importance .  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="466" name="466">Many stakeholders underlined the need for deeper pu blic information  about the FAB and its 
implications.</a></p>
<p><a id="467" name="467">This desire was evident in Manila and in Cotabato, but was even stronger in 
Zamboanga and among stakeholders from Basilan, Sulu and Tawi -Tawi.</a></p>
<p><a id="468" name="468">It was encouraging 
that both civil society and religious lea ders (whether Christian or Muslim) were keen to help 
support information efforts, but they recognised themselves that they needed to have a better 
understanding of what the implementation of the agreement will mean for the Bangsamoro as 
a whole.</a></p>
<p><a id="469" name="469">It was als o suggested that it would be important for the Parties to strengthen their 
outreach and public messaging to a wider audience, including for example local government 
units , the ulama and the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines , civil society mor e 
generally, and the private sector and chambers of commerce.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="470" name="470">Perhaps linked to this expressed need for greater information, it was evident that some 
interlocutors were concerned about the inclusiveness of the process .</a></p>
<p><a id="471" name="471">Indeed, it seemed that 
there may be a significant scope for misunderstanding about the implications of the FAB, its 
relationship with the 1996 Final Peace Agreement with the MNLF, and the likely tenor of the 
future Bangsamoro assembly and government.</a></p>
<p><a id="472" name="472">There was also a clear desire among many of 
our interlocutors to see the FAB as something which would be beneficial for all Bangsamoro, 
and not only for one or other Bangsamoro group.</a></p>
<p><a id="473" name="473">It will be important therefore for both 
Parties to do more to underline the inclusiveness of the process, no less  for Western Mindanao 
than for Central Mindanao

5)  </a></p>
<p><a id="474" name="474">Concluding remarks  
 
The TPMT’s consultations in September and December with stakeholders in Cotabato City, in 
Zamboanga and in Manila confirmed the tremendous importance which all attached to 
achievi ng a comprehensive, inclusive and sustainable peace in Mindanao, a peace which 
would bring an end to cycles of violence and displacement, and which would allow the 
tremendous economic, social and cultural potential of Mindanao to come to the fore.</a></p>
<p><a id="475" name="475">The 
tragic events of September 2013 in Zamboanga only underscored the importance of achieving 
this.</a></p>
<p><a id="476" name="476">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="477" name="477">The two Panels are to be congratulated on completing all four Annexes to the FAB.</a></p>
<p><a id="478" name="478">Looking 
forward – to the signature of the comprehensive peace agreement,  the drafting and adoption of 
the Basic Law, and the full implementation of the agreements reached  – one can clearly see 
the construction of a lasting peace . 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="479" name="479">The members of the TPMT are honoured to have been given the opportunity to play a small 
part in contributi ng to this process.</a></p>
