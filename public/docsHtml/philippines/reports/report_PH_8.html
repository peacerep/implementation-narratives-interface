<p><a id="23" name="23">Page 3 of 37  Summary         </a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">In line with the terms of reference of the Third Party Monitoring Team (TPMT), this Sixth Public Report is intended to provide an overall assessment of developments in the implementation of the agreements between the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">It covers the period from March 2019 to October 2020, continuing from the Fifth Public Report on the period July 2017 to February 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">The reporting period witnessed several key milestones in the peace process, including in particular the inaugural session of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) and the inauguration of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) on 29 March 2019 in Cotabato City.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">Under the normalization track, the launch of the second phase of decommissioning MILF combatants took place on 7 September 2019 in Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">Both events were attended by President Duterte, signifying that the peace process between the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) continues to be a priority of the Duterte administration.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">The TPMT notes as positive the significant progress in the establishment of the Bangsamoro as an autonomous political entity, thus laying the foundation for meaningful self-governance under a parliamentary form of government.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">This was reflected in the appointment of BTA members and a BARMM Cabinet as well as in setting up a ministerial structure.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">Priority codes which will define the future system of governance in the BARMM are at various stages of preparation, and the all-important Bangsamoro Administrative Code was passed by the BTA Parliament on 28 October 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">The legislative work continues at steady pace even though restrictions on travel as a result of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the BARMM have impacted on the timeline of the passage of priority legislations.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">The BTA was able to respond effectively to the pandemic by distributing relief assistance and providing for testing and isolation facilities, thus demonstrating a high degree of determination and self-reliance.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">It is noteworthy that the level of interaction between the National Government and the Bangsamoro Government through the Intergovernmental Relations Body (IGRB) has intensified, with most IGR mechanisms now in place and meetings featuring increasingly full agendas, excepting the Philippine Congress – Bangsamoro Parliament Forum (PCBPF) and the Council of Leaders.  </a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">Issues to be addressed under the political component of the transition include the delayed transfer of Cotabato City into BARMM administrative structures, which is in breach of the results of the plebiscite, as well as the circuitous ways in which block grant allocations reach the BARMM.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">Resolving these questions would go a long way in further building confidence between the parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">The third round of decommissioning has not yet commenced and is behind schedule.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">To ensure the success of the third round, and to complete the decommissioning process for the combatants from the 2nd phase, expectations of the combatants and their communities need to TPMT SIXTH PUBLIC REPORT  October 2020   
</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">Page 4 of 37  be addressed.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">It is critical to have clear information on what interventions the decommissioned combatants will receive, by when, and through what mechanisms.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">Although all decommissioned combatants have received some assistance, the bulk of the socioeconomic packages has not yet been provided, and in particular provisions for land and housing assistance for decommissioned combatants remain unclear at this stage.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">The provision of a police force for the Bangsamoro is an important part of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB), particularly in the Annex on Normalization.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">The CAB provisions were amended in the BOL to ensure consistency with the 1987 Philippine Constitution.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">It would be important to arrive at solutions on how the policing elements in the BOL could be reconciled with policing provisions in the CAB.  </a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">Joint Peace and Security Teams (JPSTs) are a creative solution of the GPH and the MILF to work together to maintain peace and order during this interim period in which the BARMM is being established but former combatants are not yet fully decommissioned.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">This would help communities that have had historically negative impressions of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) to develop trust in the regional and National Government.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">Ensuring an effective JPST presence on the ground could be one of the most visible assurances of the benefits of peace.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">JPSTs have the advantage that their members can be assigned in areas where they are familiar with the security situation.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">A number of security-related elements under the Normalization sub-track lag behind with little or no progress.  </a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">The lagging elements include disbandment of Private Armed Groups (PAGs) within BARMM and neighboring areas, transformation of MILF camps, amnesty for MILF members, redeployment of the AFP, and transitional justice and reconciliation measures.  </a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">The rehabilitation of Marawi City is proceeding at very slow pace.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">The most important issue raised during our consultations with internally displaced persons (IDPs) and civil society organizations in Marawi City was the need for the immediate return of the residents of the most affected area.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">There is a need to catch up on the education and health sector, and basic utilities and infrastructure that would enable their immediate return.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">Taking up the recommendations in the BTA special committee report (CR No. 35) to respond to these concerns will be important for community healing.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">Building a new peaceful Bangsamoro requires coming to terms with legitimate grievances, historical injustices, human rights violations, land dispossession and marginalization in order to have true healing.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">It is important to reinforce efforts on transitional justice and reconciliation to prevent future conflict and escalation of grievances.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">There are only about 18 months left until the elections in May 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">The Covid pandemic poses a significant challenge for the BARMM and the transition.  </a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Against this background, the TPMT is encouraged to note that the peace process remains fundamentally on track and that both parties continue to be fully committed to the implementation of the signed agreements.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">But it has become clear that many elements of the transition process will require TPMT SIXTH PUBLIC REPORT  October 2020   
</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">Page 5 of 37  more time in order to bring the process to a successful conclusion.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">This relates in particular to the normalization track which should go hand in hand with political achievements.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Looking forward, and in spite of possible delays as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the TPMT encourages the parties to continue to demonstrate a spirit of continuity in the implementation of the peace process, in particular by:</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64"> </a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">•</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Completing work on the priority legislation for the BTA, to create the foundations of governance for the BARMM;</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">•</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">Completing the administrative transfer of Cotabato City including offices of the National Government into the BARMM as per the plebiscite results;</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">•</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">Addressing the issue of socioeconomic support for decommissioned combatants and their families as a necessary condition for their transition to civilian life;</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">•</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">Putting the Bangsamoro Normalization Trust Fund (BNTF) into operation as quickly as possible, specifically for the provision of socioeconomic development programs and the transformation of MILF camps;</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">•</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">Reducing the gap in perspectives between the two parties in the field of policing;</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75"> </a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">•</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">Further expanding the network of Joint Peace and Security Teams (JPSTs) and rendering them fully functional towards ensuring peace and order in communities with a sensitive security environment.  </a></p>

<p><a id="80" name="80">TPMT mandate, members and activities The TPMT was established in July 2013, as foreseen in the respective provisions of the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro (FAB) and its Annex on Transitional Arrangements and Modalities, as incorporated into the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB), and in line with the Terms of Reference (TOR) of the TPMT agreed by the Panels on 25 January 2013 (Annex I).  </a></p>

<p><a id="134" name="134">Other key milestones in the Normalization process are the training and deployment of a small number of Joint Peace and Security Teams (JPSTs) from the intended total 200 teams, although the parties could not yet find common agreement on the status of MILF combatants and parities of firearms within JPSTs.  </a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">The reorganization and renaming of the Philippine National Police Regional Office Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (PNP PRO-ARMM) to the PNP PRO-BAR (Bangsamoro Autonomous Region) took effect through Resolution No. 2019-634 issued by the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) on 24 September 2019.</a></p>

<p><a id="192" name="192">The postponement of BTA sessions and restrictions on travel as a result of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the BARMM has impacted on the timeline of the passage of these priority legislations.</a></p>

<p><a id="194" name="194">The BTA also needs to manage the expectations of BARMM citizens, including through consultations to ensure an inclusive legislative process.</a></p>
<p><a id="195" name="195">The TPMT notes that the Bangsamoro Administrative Code (BAC), which defines the structural, functional and procedural principles and rules of governance for the region, was passed by Parliament on 28 October 2020.</a></p>

<p><a id="201" name="201">Furthermore, the BTA enacted 12 Bangsamoro Autonomy Acts, including adoption of official flag, official emblem and official hymn of the BARMM as well as the creation of new offices, in particular the Bangsamoro Human Rights Commission (BHRC-BARMM), the Bangsamoro Attorney General’s Office (BAGO-BARMM), the Bangsamoro Women Commission (BWC-BARMM), the Bangsamoro Youth Commission (BYC-BARMM) and the Bangsamoro Sports Commission (BSC-BARMM).  </a></p>

<p><a id="208" name="208">The BTA formally approved the proposed transition plan in a special session on 17 June 2019, even while noting a number of elements of the plan requiring further clarification.</a></p>
<p><a id="209" name="209">During the consultations conducted by the TPMT, a number of issues with respect to the functioning of the BTA were raised, including the salaries of employees, release of funds for the BARMM, and the timeline of the formal separation of ARMM personnel.  </a></p>
<p><a id="210" name="210">The release of the initial block grant for the BARMM, along with the passage of the B.A.A. No. 3 or the F.Y. 2020 Bangsamoro Appropriations Act on 29 November 2019, is a notable positive step.</a></p>
<p><a id="211" name="211">It is important that there is clear, written agreement on the regularity of the release of funds.</a></p>
<p><a id="212" name="212">We note that the constitution of the Intergovernmental Fiscal Policy Board (IFPB) at its first meeting on 29 May 2020 is a step towards that.</a></p>
<p><a id="213" name="213">Fiscal autonomy is one of the key components of the BOL, and that can only be achieved if there is regularity and transparency.</a></p>
<p><a id="214" name="214">The Bangsamoro Government should also clearly communicate to the public the funds it is receiving.</a></p>
<p><a id="215" name="215">The transfer of the block grant still follows a circuitous route before it reaches the BARMM, this is not in line with the BOL which stipulates that funds should be appropriated automatically, directly and comprehensively.  </a></p>
<p><a id="216" name="216">The separation of all the ARMM personnel was a high-risk approach, given that it left the Bangsamoro Government with only skeletal staff at the end of 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="217" name="217">However, the process of recruitment of BARMM employees appears to have been transparent and well-organized, with the introduction of the Bangsamoro Jobs Portal.</a></p>
<p><a id="218" name="218">Success for the BARMM in 2020 and beyond will depend to a large degree on the speed with which the recruitment process can be completed, and the quality of the employees who are selected from that recruitment process.</a></p>
<p><a id="219" name="219">Turnover of Cotabato City and the 63 barangays of North Cotabato to the BARMM As a result of the plebiscite for the BOL conducted on 21 January 2019 and 6 February 2019, Cotabato City and the 63 barangays of North Cotabato are effectively included in the BARMM.</a></p>
<p><a id="220" name="220">On 20 November 2019, the North Cotabato Provincial Local Government Unit (LGU) formally turned over the 63 barangays to the BARMM in an event at the Shariff Kabunsuan Cultural Complex in Cotabato City.</a></p>
<p><a id="221" name="221">The BTA is yet to enact legislation on how the 63 barangays will be administered, as the process of reconstituting these barangays is unclear:</a></p>
<p><a id="222" name="222">whether these will be under a special administrative zone or through the formation of new municipalities.</a></p>
<p><a id="223" name="223">Meanwhile, the Bangsamoro Government already made the temporary administrative structure for the 63 barangays through the establishment of a Development Coordination Office.</a></p>
<p><a id="224" name="224">Cotabato City, however, is not yet formally turned over to the BARMM, and effectively not within the administrative authority of the BARMM, despite the seat of regional government, the Bangsamoro Government Center, being located therein.</a></p>

<p><a id="238" name="238">The reconstitution of the 63 barangays of North Cotabato and the legal challenges to the BOL should be addressed proactively, especially before the regular elections for the Bangsamoro Parliament in 2022, so that the boundaries of the BARMM are clear, and the space for legal disputes is diminished.</a></p>

<p><a id="493" name="493">In addition, almost all members of the BTC were also appointed to the BTA.</a></p>
<p><a id="494" name="494">However, there is one important remaining task from Executive Order No. 8, s. 2016 which mandates the BTC to “recommend to Congress or the people proposed amendments to the 1987 Philippine Constitution”.</a></p>
<p><a id="495" name="495">We understand that the BTC formed a working group on this task and a report was already drafted but it has not yet been submitted to Congress.</a></p>
<p><a id="496" name="496">It may be a final step in recognizing the legacy of the late BTC Chair and MILF Vice-Chair Ghazali Jaafar for this to be completed.</a></p>
<p><a id="497" name="497">Recovery and Rehabilitation of Marawi City There is still frustration and a lack of information among constituents on the recovery and rehabilitation of the most affected area in Marawi City led by the Task Force Bangon Marawi (TFBM), which is becoming more of a stumbling block rather than a facilitator of transformation in the city.</a></p>
<p><a id="498" name="498">The plans for rehabilitation have been prepared almost completely without the participation of residents.</a></p>
<p><a id="499" name="499">The recent resolutions and hearings by the BTA with respect to Marawi City are helpful, and the ‘Committee Report No. 35’ of the BTA Special Committee on Marawi issued on 29 August 2020 documented in forensic detail the status, updates, issues, concerns and recommendations for Marawi.</a></p>
<p><a id="500" name="500">The report stressed the need for BTA-led organizational interventions through a Coordinating Board or Program Management Office (PMO);</a></p>
<p><a id="501" name="501">it also called for addressing data gaps including on household profiles and property ownership and advocated continued assistance to IDPs, in particular to ensure food security.</a></p>
<p><a id="502" name="502">Follow through on those recommendations will be important for all.</a></p>

<p><a id="504" name="504">Page 24 of 37  </a></p>
<p><a id="505" name="505">A number of stakeholders also raised concerns about the announcement of a new AFP base in Marawi City, apparently without consultation with the Bangsamoro Government.</a></p>
<p><a id="506" name="506">This is against the spirit of the redeployment of the AFP as a dimension of the Program for Normalization.</a></p>
<p><a id="507" name="507">The most important issue raised during our consultations with internally displaced persons (IDPs) and civil society organizations in Marawi City was the need for the immediate return of the residents of the most affected area.</a></p>
<p><a id="508" name="508">There is a need to catch up on the education and health sector, and basic utilities and infrastructure that will enable their immediate return.</a></p>
<p><a id="509" name="509">They also raised the human rights violations that have occurred, particularly during the siege, including the disappearances of people.</a></p>
<p><a id="510" name="510">Taking up the recommendations in the BTA special committee report to respond to these concerns will be important for community healing.</a></p>
<p><a id="511" name="511">Indigenous Peoples and the BARMM</a></p>
<p><a id="512" name="512">In the past year there have been several incidents of violence, in particular the killings of some indigenous persons and the displacement of more than 100 families who fled to safer areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="513" name="513">  </a></p>
<p><a id="514" name="514">The conflicts included long-standing land disputes in areas considered as ancestral domain by IPs but had also been occupied for a certain period by Moro families based on a Marcos era decree.  </a></p>
<p><a id="515" name="515">Relief support was provided to the internally displaced persons and eventually the conflicts were resolved or temporarily paused with the negotiation efforts of the LGUs, the GPH -MILF CCCH and other intervenors.</a></p>
<p><a id="516" name="516">There continues to be discontent among the non-Moro IPs, particularly the Teduray, Lambangian and Dulangen-Manobo ethnic groups who seek the implementation of the IPRA (Indigenous Peoples Rights Act – R.A. 8371) as guaranteed by the Bangsamoro Organic Law.  </a></p>
<p><a id="517" name="517">The Indigenous Peoples’ Code that proposes to provide a better IPRA is still undergoing consultation and will need to respond to the concerns and assertions of the IP constituency.</a></p>
<p><a id="518" name="518">One of the topical issues that would warrant focus in future meetings of the IGRB is to clarify the authority of various agencies of the National Government and of the Bangsamoro Government with respect to issues of indigenous peoples (IPs).</a></p>
<p><a id="519" name="519">There is an ongoing dispute between the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) and the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples Affairs (MIPA-BARMM).</a></p>
<p><a id="520" name="520">Based on our consultations with IPs in the BARMM, particularly in South Upi, Maguindanao, there seems to be no clear indication which agency will respond to their concerns, and there is also no clear arbitration or mediation mechanism.  </a></p>
<p><a id="521" name="521">Rido and internal displacement</a></p>
<p><a id="522" name="522">The escalation of rido in Maguindanao may have a lasting effect in the peace process if not addressed as soon as possible, especially that most incidents involve Moro and non-Moro indigenous peoples.</a></p>
<p><a id="523" name="523">Communities are not just faced with internal displacement but with the threat of COVID-19 as well, as it is difficult to follow health protocols inside cramped TPMT SIXTH PUBLIC REPORT  October 2020

<p><a id="525" name="525">The immediate deployment of JPSTs in conflict-vulnerable areas is important to mitigate the situation.</a></p>
<p><a id="526" name="526">Engagement across the BARMM A major issue arising from our consultation with stakeholders in Sulu is the importance of having an increased presence of the Bangsamoro Government in south western Mindanao, or the island provinces in the BARMM, namely:</a></p>
<p><a id="527" name="527">Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi.</a></p>
<p><a id="528" name="528">The TPMT suggests that an engagement strategy bringing together all Ministries would be useful, and could incorporate steps such as holding future Cabinet meetings of the Bangsamoro Government in those provinces, sending the signal of relevance of these provinces for the BARMM.</a></p>
<p><a id="529" name="529">The distance of offices of the Bangsamoro Government in Cotabato City to these provinces is also a real problem.</a></p>
<p><a id="530" name="530">The TPMT recommends considering the establishment of satellite offices for major ministries in these provinces.</a></p>
<p><a id="531" name="531">The TPMT notes that there should be a mechanism that will involve the civil society in governance in the BARMM, as it is an important partner in ensuring transparency and accountability.</a></p>
<p><a id="532" name="532">Chairmanship of the TPMT</a></p>
<p><a id="533" name="533">The members of the TPMT would like to note with thanks the recognition the Panels extended to our late Chair Alistair MacDonald.</a></p>
<p><a id="534" name="534">He was a good man, truly committed to peace, and he contributed a lot to the peace efforts in the Bangsamoro through his various roles in the Delegation of the European Union in the Philippines and with us in the TPMT.</a></p>
<p><a id="535" name="535">6.</a></p>
<p><a id="536" name="536">Comment The path towards peace in the Bangsamoro has taken significant steps forward over the period covered in this report.</a></p>
<p><a id="537" name="537">The endorsement of the BOL by a clear majority of BARMM citizens in early 2019 led rapidly to the peaceful transfer of power from the ARMM to the new BTA appointed officials.</a></p>
<p><a id="538" name="538">The appointment of the BTA members, the creation of a BARMM Cabinet, the passage of the Transition Plan, the establishment of the Ministry structures, the passage of the first budget in late 2019, the incorporation of the 63 barangays of North Cotabato into BARMM, the passage of the Administrative Code – all these steps should not be taken for granted.</a></p>
<p><a id="539" name="539">Political transitions such as these require commitment from a wide range of actors, and in this case the first 20 months of the transition have been remarkably smooth.</a></p>
<p><a id="540" name="540">In parallel to the orderly process of establishment of a new regional government the normalization process has also continued peacefully.</a></p>
<p><a id="541" name="541">Completing the first steps of decommissioning 12,000 BIAF combatants and 2,100 weapons is a major success.</a></p>
<p><a id="542" name="542">The Government and the MILF need to work together to follow through on the remaining commitments to those combatants who have entered into this process in good faith, and they can do so with great hope based on the success of Phase 2 of decommissioning.</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="544" name="544">Page 26 of 37  </a></p>
<p><a id="545" name="545">However there are also a number of continuing challenges which should guard against complacency with respect to the fulfilment of the CAB, and against complacency with respect to the prospects for long-term peace in BARMM.  </a></p>
<p><a id="546" name="546">- Incomplete institutional structures:</a></p>
<p><a id="547" name="547">The advent of the Coronavirus pandemic in early 2020 came at a very inopportune time for the BARMM.</a></p>
<p><a id="548" name="548">With the decision to request for the separation of all ARMM employees the region was caught short-staffed when the quarantine restrictions caused recruitment processes to go on hold in March 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="549" name="549">The BARMM has established a transparent, open and public recruiting process for all employees of the region, a first.</a></p>
<p><a id="550" name="550">However the delays in recruitment will have flow-through implications for the institutionalization of key changes, delays in the passage of key legislation, and ultimately delays in delivery of BARMM programs across the region.</a></p>
<p><a id="551" name="551">   - BTA full exercise of powers:</a></p>
<p><a id="552" name="552">the creation of a fully-functioning, robust parliament will take time.</a></p>
<p><a id="553" name="553">It also requires all parties to accept that public debate, criticism and disagreement on matters of policy and process will occur.</a></p>
<p><a id="554" name="554">This can appear to be confusing, especially if the public are used to a centralized policy-making process.</a></p>
<p><a id="555" name="555">However in order to sow the long-term foundations for healthy parliamentary democracy in the Bangsamoro the BTA needs to exercise its full powers, and not be restricted to approval of legislation drafted by the Executive or in Cabinet.  - Financing and funding:</a></p>
<p><a id="556" name="556">fiscal autonomy for the region is a core building block of the CAB and BOL.</a></p>
<p><a id="557" name="557">The early steps towards this have been positive – the Block Grant is released each month, and the amounts are sufficient to establish and run the BARMM.</a></p>
<p><a id="558" name="558">However there are many elements of the fiscal arrangements which need to change to reflect the provisions of the BOL.</a></p>
<p><a id="559" name="559">If those are not updated there is a risk that a ‘spoke-in-the-wheel’ at some future point could cause serious damage to trajectory of the peace process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="560" name="560">- Collaboration:</a></p>
<p><a id="561" name="561">completing the journey to full implementation of the CAB requires both the GPH and the MILF to continue to work together, hand-in-hand.</a></p>
<p><a id="562" name="562">There are many concrete examples of this at present.</a></p>
<p><a id="563" name="563">However there are also some examples of the national government implementing solutions and initiatives unilaterally.</a></p>
<p><a id="564" name="564">Establishment of an effective BARMM government will require both parties to collaborate, and acknowledge that neither can succeed without the full participation of the other.</a></p>
<p><a id="565" name="565">Central to this will be the full functioning of the IGRB.</a></p>
<p><a id="566" name="566">- Marawi:</a></p>
<p><a id="567" name="567">for three years a large portion of the citizens of Marawi have been removed from their homes and their history.</a></p>
<p><a id="568" name="568">Despite many promises the rehabilitation of the city and return of citizens to the most-affected area has no clear end date.  </a></p>
<p><a id="569" name="569">- Normalization:</a></p>
<p><a id="570" name="570">the architecture for normalizing the situation for 40,000 MILF combatants was designed and negotiated over many years.</a></p>
<p><a id="571" name="571">Convincing 12,145 members of the BIAF to lay down their arms and decommission in the completed Phase 2 is a fantastic achievement.</a></p>
<p><a id="572" name="572">It is vitally important that both the GPH and MILF continue to commit to the steps agreed in the normalization process, including TPMT SIXTH PUBLIC REPORT  October 2020   
</a></p>
<p><a id="573" name="573">Page 27 of 37  completing the packages of support for the 12,145, in order to signal to the remaining BIAF forces that they can continue to trust the decommissioning process.</a></p>
<p><a id="574" name="574">  </a></p>
<p><a id="575" name="575">- Violence continues:</a></p>
<p><a id="576" name="576">although Covid-19 restrictions appear to have lessened the prevalence of local conflict, there are still regular clashes between the AFP and elements of the BIFF in central Mindanao, occasional outbreaks of local conflict in Lanao del Sur, and continuing clashes with ASG elements in Sulu, including high-profile suicide bombings.</a></p>
<p><a id="577" name="577">Any scaling up of these can trigger serious consequences.</a></p>
<p><a id="578" name="578">The AFP and PNP need to continue to reach out to the BIAF, and to build more effective responses to the BIFF, ASG and other groups together.</a></p>
<p><a id="579" name="579">The first steps of this transition period began two years ago with the passage of the BOL by Congress.</a></p>
<p><a id="580" name="580">There are less than two years remaining up until the conduct of the first BARMM elections in 2022 and the election of the first Bangsamoro parliament.</a></p>
<p><a id="581" name="581">The challenges outlined above illustrate that much remains to be done and that the remaining timeframe to complete the transition is rather tight.</a></p>
<p><a id="582" name="582">The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has considerably complicated this picture.</a></p>
<p><a id="583" name="583">Everything considered, we as members of the TPMT believe that at this point in the transition there is much for all Filipinos to be proud of – a peace which is holding, institutions which are growing, and partners who have weathered all the storms through 2019 and most of 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="584" name="584">There is an opportunity for all Filipinos to continue to build on what has been achieved and to further define a favourable context under which the transition can be brought to a successful conclusion.   </a></p>

<p><a id="589" name="589">Alistair MacDonald passed away on the 26th April 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="590" name="590">He served as Chair of the TPMT from its inception in 2013 until 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="591" name="591">Alistair was born in Glasgow, Scotland, trained as an economist and economic historian, and had a distinguished diplomatic career of 35 years in the external service of the European Union.</a></p>
<p><a id="592" name="592">His assignments included two postings in the Philippines (including as EU Ambassador, from November 2006 to January 2011), as well as postings in Myanmar, Fiji, Libya and Thailand, and headquarters assignments in Brussels covering SE Asia or Eastern Europe.</a></p>
<p><a id="593" name="593">Alistair was awarded the Order of Sikatuna with a rank of Datu by the Philippine Government for his contributions.</a></p>
<p><a id="594" name="594">The TPMT Chairperson is jointly nominated by the Philippine Government and the MILF, and it was not difficult for the negotiating parties to mutually agree on Alistair MacDonald based on confidence built during his term as EU Ambassador.  </a></p>
<p><a id="595" name="595">Alistair brought into the TPMT work his relationships of trust and good will with Mindanao peacebuilders from all sectors, as well as his experience with international development contexts.   </a></p>
<p><a id="596" name="596">He directed the course of the TPMT, that has valued direct discussions with the major actors and diverse stakeholders in assessing the implementation of the CAB, aside from the gathering of reports and data.  </a></p>
<p><a id="597" name="597">He had a system for retaining excellent memory of the many details relayed by various interlocutors.</a></p>
<p><a id="598" name="598">At the same time, Alistair was constantly looking at the larger picture of peace in the Bangsamoro.  </a></p>
<p><a id="599" name="599">He often referred to the “prize of peace”:</a></p>
<p><a id="600" name="600"> </a></p>
<p><a id="601" name="601">“But while the challenges are great, the prizes to be gained are even greater – creating a sustainable peace, allowing the region to achieve its full potential and to contribute more effectively to the prosperity and security of the nation as a whole.</a></p>
<p><a id="602" name="602">And the best guarantees of success are the continuing commitment to peace of both Parties, at the highest level, the massive engagement of Congress and the public in deliberating on the BBL, and the underlying hopes of the people of Mindanao that their children should be able to grow and prosper in a peaceful and just society.”</a></p>
<p><a id="603" name="603">He is sorely missed, especially by his friends in the Bangsamoro peace process.   </a></p>
