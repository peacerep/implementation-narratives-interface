Page 8 of 62  Third Party Monitoring Team Eighth Public Report, February 2022 to October 2023 1.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">Summary In line with the Terms of Reference of the Third Party Monitoring Team (TPMT), this eighth public report intends to provide an overall assessment of developments in the implementation of the Agreements between the Government of the Philippines (GPH) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), hereafter referred to as the Parties, as incorporated into the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) signed on 27 March 2014.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">This includes in particular the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro signed on 15 October 2012.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">The report covers the period from February 2022 to October 2023 (see Annexes I, II and III for TPMT Terms of Reference, members and summary of TPMT monitoring sessions during the reporting period).</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The transition phase of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) was extended by three years until 30 June 2025 following an amendment of Republic Act (RA) No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) passed by Congress in October 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">Another extension of the transition phase is not likely and the BARMM is preparing for the first regional elections to take place in May 2025.  </a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">Following the May 2022 national and local elections a new administration took over in Manila.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. appointed the 80-member Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA) Parliament to serve for the remainder of the transition phase.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">The MILF continues to lead the interim BTA government and Chief Minister Murad Ebrahim remains in charge of the interim Cabinet.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">The GPH and MILF Peace Implementing Panels (the Panels) were reconstituted, as was the Intergovernmental Relations Body (IGRB).</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">The Bangsamoro peace process follows two tracks.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The political track aims at ensuring meaningful self-governance for the Bangsamoro by establishing the BARMM as a new and democratic political entity.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">The normalization track focuses on the gradual normalization of conflict-affected areas and their transformation into peaceful and progressive communities.  </a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">The reporting period witnessed solid progress on the political track.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">The newly appointed BTA Parliament was quick to focus on essential legislative work.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">It enacted the Bangsamoro Electoral Code (BEC) on 8 March 2023 which defines the framework for the May 2025 regional elections.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">The Bangsamoro Local Governance Code (BLGC), which determines the relationship between the regional government and its local government units (LGUs), was adopted on 28 September 2023.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">All priority legislation is now in place with the exception of the Bangsamoro Revenue Code (BRC) and the Indigenous Peoples (IP) Code.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">On 17 August 2023, the BTA Parliament approved bills establishing 8 municipalities comprising the 63 Special Geographic Area (SGA) barangays in North Cotabato province that opted to join the BARMM during the 6 February 2019 plebiscite.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">TPMT EIGHTH PUBLIC REPORT              October 2023   
</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">Page 9 of 62  Budget Secretary Amenah F. Pangandaman has taken over as Co-chair of the IGRB on the National Government side, whereas Education Minister Mohagher M. Iqbal remains as Co-chair on behalf of the Bangsamoro Government.  </a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">The IGRB continues to perform its crucial coordination function between the two governments.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">Among the priority issues tackled by the IGRB feature policing and co-management of energy resources.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">An Intergovernmental Energy Board (IEB) Circular on the joint exploration, development, and utilization of energy resources within the territorial jurisdiction of the Bangsamoro was signed on 6 July 2023.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">All intergovernmental relations (IGR) mechanisms are now operational.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">The Philippine Congress – Bangsamoro Parliament Forum (PCBPF) convened for the first time on 15 November 2022 and the first meeting of the Council of Leaders (CoL) took place on 9 August 2023.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">Regular meetings of the CoL are particularly important to ensure effective coordination between the regional government and LGUs.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Progress on the normalization track has been comparatively slow.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">A ceremony to conclude the third phase of decommissioning took place on 3 August 2023.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">The total figure now stands at 26,132 decommissioned combatants and 4,625 firearms which were placed in the custody of the Independent Decommissioning Body (IDB).</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">The GPH and the MILF hope to complete decommissioning before the regional elections in May 2025.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">The MILF has not yet provided the list for the fourth and final phase which is necessary to reach the targeted number of 40,000 decommissioned combatants and 7,000 weapons.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">The effective provision of socioeconomic benefit packages for decommissioned combatants is still under discussion by the Parties.  </a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Recruitment into the police commenced in 2023, albeit much later than originally anticipated.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">In May 2022, the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) conducted a Special Qualifying Eligibility (NSQE) Examination for MILF and Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) members, which 7,145 out of 11,075 applicants passed successfully.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Subsequently, Interior Secretary Benhur C. Abalos Jr. announced that 400 slots were allocated as a recruitment quota for MILF and MNLF in 2023.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">On 10 August 2023, 102 recruits (52 from the MILF and 50 from the MNLF) took their oath as officers of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Police Regional Office in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region (PRO BAR).</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">More candidates are undergoing a screening process.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">The question is how many former MILF and MNLF can be accommodated and whether the 5-year waiver period in the BOL on educational, age, and height requirements which expires in January 2024 can be adjusted.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">The period to file amnesty applications under Presidential Proclamations issued in February 2021 has already expired.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">We note as positive that a National Amnesty Commission (NAC), chaired by Attorney Leah Tanodra-Armamento, was appointed on 13 January 2023.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">At the time of finalizing this report the NAC had not yet started to work on individual cases in anticipation of revised Presidential Proclamations to extend the application period.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">The actual application process will be administered through local amnesty boards composed representatives of religious groups, local chief executives, prosecutors, security services, and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">Only crimes perpetrated in pursuit of political beliefs fall under amnesty.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">A swift resolution of amnesty cases is particularly important for MILF members, including some already serving as BTA Members of Parliament (MPs), who have cases filed against them and who intend to run as candidates during the 2025 elections.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">TPMT EIGHTH PUBLIC REPORT              October 2023   
Page 10 of 62  Other elements of the normalization track are still in the initial stages of implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">A six-year Camps Transformation Plan (CTP) was approved by the Panels in 2021 but has not advanced much from the conceptual stage.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">So far only a limited number of private armed groups (PAGs) has been disbanded.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">Proposals for Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) redeployment parameters continue to be under discussion.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">There are moves in the House of Representatives and Senate to pass a law creating a National Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission for the Bangsamoro (NTJRCB), but it is uncertain whether this initiative will be given priority status.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">Compensation of victims of the 2017 Marawi siege commenced six years after the event.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">On 30 January 2023, President Marcos Jr. appointed nine members of the Marawi Compensation Board (MCB), chaired by Atty.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">Maisara C. Dandamun-Latiph.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">The MCB has begun to assess compensation for residents who lost properties and lives as a result of the siege.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">The initial allocation for the year 2023 under the Marawi Siege Victims’ Compensation Act amounts to PhP1 billion.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">The total number of potential claims is estimated at PhP89 billion, therefore allocations will need to be substantially increased in the coming years.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">It is encouraging to record that the number of ceasefire violations between the Parties remains low.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">Nonetheless armed skirmishes between the GPH and MILF still occur on occasion.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">A recent example is a law enforcement operation in Datu Paglas municipality on 18 June 2023.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">The MILF mourned the loss of seven of its members including two decommissioned combatants and temporarily suspended the finalization of the third phase of the decommissioning process.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">A joint investigation of the incident by the Parties did not take place.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">The Malaysia-led International Monitoring Team (IMT), charged with monitoring the implementation of the 1997 GPH-MILF Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities, left Mindanao on 30 June 2022 as the GPH did not extend its mandate.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">Independent field verifications of this and other incidents can therefore no longer be carried out.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">-------------------------- TPMT EIGHTH PUBLIC REPORT              October 2023   
Page 11 of 62  2.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">Comment After decades of conflict implementation of the CAB offers the opportunity to arrive at sustained peace in Mindanao.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">Peace is the basis for unlocking the region’s full potential which will benefit the people in the Bangsamoro and the Philippines as a whole.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">The transition period in the Bangsamoro ends on 30 June 2025.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">As we issue this report there are only 16 months left until the first election of the 80-member Bangsamoro Parliament in May 2025.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">The remaining period for the MILF-led transitional government to consolidate the foundations for meaningful self-governance in the Bangsamoro in line with the ambitions spelled out by the Parties in the CAB is therefore limited.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">The CAB was painstakingly negotiated under consideration of all relevant aspect to achieve lasting peace in the Southern Philippines.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">The Parties negotiated a strong and workable autonomy settlement.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">It formally recognizes the Bangsamoro identity, acknowledges legitimate grievances, and aims to establish a new political entity in the form of a representative government for the Bangsamoro.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">As such, the CAB represents a very precious achievement and deserves to be held in high esteem by both Parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">Dilution of negotiated provisions and excessive implementation delays lower the chances of ultimate success of the peace process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">That said, we are aware that it has now been some 10 years since the CAB was negotiated.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">Conditions on the ground may change;</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">therefore, there has to be scope for flexibility in the implementation of the peace agreements, provided both Parties agree on the way forward.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">A change in administrations always brings with it some natural delay as new protagonists are appointed and need to familiarize themselves with relevant dossiers, even though there has been a high degree of continuity both in the MILF-led BTA in Cotabato and the OPAPRU in Manila.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">Then again, change also offers scope for improvement.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">We identify as positive and encouraging the following developments in the peace process:</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">•</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">Both Parties remain fully committed to the peace process, including at the highest levels.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">The lines of communication between the Parties remain open.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">The first meeting of the reconstituted Peace Implementing Panels on 1 July 2023 re-affirmed, along with the entire peace mechanisms, their commitment to the continued implementation of the CAB and the achievement of just and lasting peace in the Bangsamoro and in the entire country.</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">President Marcos Jr. at the SONA on 24 July 2023 expressed pride in progress taken by the BARMM and pledged his administration’s continued support for the peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">•</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">We further acknowledge good progress on the political track.</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">The BTA Parliament has taken on a proactive role in adopting priority legislations, five so far including the Electoral Code and the Local Governance Code during the reporting period.</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">The regional government is arguably still in its formative years but has overcome initial limitations in particular due to the Coronavirus and an intricate recruitment process and has stepped up performance in delivering results to the Bangsamoro population.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">The TPMT EIGHTH PUBLIC REPORT              October 2023   
Page 12 of 62  foundations for meaningful self-governance in the Bangsamoro have been laid which in itself is a magnificent achievement.</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">•</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">In a major win for the peace process, all factions of the Moro National Liberation Front are now represented in the BTA parliament in a spirit of unity and convergence.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">•</a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">The Intergovernmental Relations Body (IGRB) has consolidated its role as the main forum to address and resolve practical questions affecting the work of the Bangsamoro Government and the National Government.</a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">All mechanisms under the IGRB are now operational.</a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">The IGRB is a success story of the peace process and its role has been invaluable.   </a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">•</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">While progress on normalization has been slow, which is acknowledged by both Parties, there is a perceptible new drive on behalf of the GPH to fast-track the implementation of the normalization process and to provide increased resources for this purpose.</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">New concepts for more effective performance delivery are under consideration.</a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">The Bangsamoro government has signaled flexibility to contribute to these efforts, albeit without neglecting its responsibilities to cater for the entire Bangsamoro population.</a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">•</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">The TPMT notes as positive the active involvement of women in the peace process, which finds expression in the quality of female participation in the BTA as well as the energetic role taken up by the Bangsamoro Women’s Commission (BWC).</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">The BWC and women civil society organizations as well as women parliamentarians themselves ensured the provision in the Electoral Code that at least 30% of political party nominees must be women.</a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">Women have reportedly also become more active in peace mediation at community level.</a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">That said, many of the various peace mechanisms still lack women representation in the decision-making levels of both parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="129" name="129">•</a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">Marawi compensation is not covered under the peace agreements (the siege took place after signature of the CAB).</a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">Nonetheless, we observe the dedicated and professional work quickly initiated by the Marawi Compensation Board (MCB).</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">For the MCB to complete its task budgetary allocations for Marawi compensation will have to increase substantially.</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">  </a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">While the Bangsamoro peace process has come a long way, there are a number of challenges which need to be tackled to bring it to a successful conclusion:</a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">•</a></p>
<p><a id="136" name="136">The Parties differ in their perception on what the peace agreements ultimately are about.</a></p>
<p><a id="137" name="137">The majority perspective from Manila is for a BARMM administration forming part of an integrated government structure under a presidential system, whereas the MILF leadership believes that it negotiated agreements with the ambition to strive towards real autonomy and meaningful self-governance.</a></p>
<p><a id="138" name="138">Fundamental differences in perception will ultimately have to be overcome for the peace process to succeed.</a></p>
<p><a id="139" name="139">TPMT EIGHTH PUBLIC REPORT              October 2023   
Page 13 of 62  •</a></p>
<p><a id="140" name="140">There are also variances in perspective on some crucial elements of the normalization track, including on how to bring the decommissioning process to a successful conclusion, the shape of policing in the BARMM, how to implement the ceasefire mechanisms and how to progress on transitional justice and reconciliation (TJR).</a></p>
<p><a id="141" name="141">•</a></p>
<p><a id="142" name="142">Within the normalization track we observe an emphasis on formal decommissioning of MILF Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF) members through the Independent Decommissioning Body (IDB) while other elements of the normalization track continue to lag behind.</a></p>
<p><a id="143" name="143">At the same time there has been limited progress on other elements of normalization including socioeconomic support to decommissioned combatants, camps transformation, disbandment of private armed groups (PAGs), amnesty, policing, redeployment of the AFP, and TJR.</a></p>
<p><a id="144" name="144">Care should be taken to prevent imbalances from undermining the integrity of the peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="145" name="145">According to the CAB, decommissioning should be parallel and commensurate to the implementation of all the agreements of the Parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="146" name="146">•</a></p>
<p><a id="147" name="147">The implementation of normalization also requires management capacity and a realistic assessment of implementation capacity.</a></p>
<p><a id="148" name="148">Primarily, this rests with the Panels and the Joint Normalization Committee (JNC).</a></p>
<p><a id="149" name="149">As the implementation of the peace process evolves, it has become apparent that the peace mechanisms have increasingly become exposed to overlapping responsibilities.</a></p>
<p><a id="150" name="150">Examples of this are the Inter-Cabinet Cluster Mechanism on Normalization (ICCMN) acting unilaterally on issues related to normalization and the IGRB being asked to look into issues which cannot be sorted out between the Panels.</a></p>
<p><a id="151" name="151">Arguably, this has resulted in a watering down of the peace process architecture.</a></p>
<p><a id="152" name="152">•</a></p>

<p><a id="330" name="330">The question was how the incoming President would handle his responsibility to appoint the new members of the BTA.  </a></p>
<p><a id="331" name="331">There appeared to be different legal interpretations on what flexibility the incoming President had in making BTA appointments, in particular whether the established 41:39 majority of the MILF in the BTA could be challenged.</a></p>
<p><a id="332" name="332">Some legal experts expressed the view that the wording "...the President may appoint the eighty (80) new interim members of the BTA..." in RA No. 11593 gave him freedom to act as he saw fit.</a></p>

<p><a id="378" name="378">As it turned out the Parties did not reach agreement on a renewed approach.</a></p>
<p><a id="379" name="379">The Panels, at the meeting on 3 June 2022, also proposed to set up a TWG for the police force in the Bangsamoro and advised the TWG-TJR to also invite international experts to provide advice on the crafting of the TJR roadmap.</a></p>

<p><a id="409" name="409">The 80-member BTA, appointed by the President, has legislative authority while executive authority rests with the interim Chief Minister and his interim Cabinet.</a></p>
<p><a id="410" name="410">President Marcos Jr. attended the BTA inaugural session which took place on 15 September 2022 at the Bangsamoro Government Center in Cotabato City.</a></p>
<p><a id="411" name="411">During this event, Chief Minister Ebrahim assured the President that the BTA would complete all transition priorities and finish setting up a regional government ready for peaceful and orderly elections in 2025 and capable of continuing the transformation.</a></p>
<p><a id="412" name="412">The President had earlier, during the oath taking ceremony of the new BTA members at Malacañan Palace on 12 August 2022, declared that there would be no further extension of the transition period and that first-time regional elections in the BARMM should take place in 2025.</a></p>
<p><a id="413" name="413">The newly appointed BTA Parliament has since placed priority on finalizing and passing the remaining priority codes.</a></p>
<p><a id="414" name="414">On 8 March 2023, it enacted the Bangsamoro Electoral Code (BEC) which defines the legal framework for the May 2025 regional elections.</a></p>
<p><a id="415" name="415">The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) was consulted during the preparation of the Code.</a></p>
<p><a id="416" name="416">Following its adoption, the BEC was challenged in the SC by 15 BARMM local executives and officials.</a></p>
<p><a id="417" name="417">The petition reflects public criticism on the 10,000-membership minimum requirement for regional political parties and the 4% threshold to obtain a parliamentary party seat under the proportional representation system.</a></p>
<p><a id="418" name="418">According to the petitioners, the Code violates the powers exclusively vested by the Constitution upon COMELEC over the administration of election laws, curtails what should be free and equal opportunity for political parties to seek and obtain parliamentary seats, and intrudes into the power of Congress to define and penalize election offenses.</a></p>
<p><a id="419" name="419">BTA members have pointed out that the singularity of elections in the BARMM needs to be properly reflected by the BEC.</a></p>
<p><a id="420" name="420">A sensitive point under the BEC is the delimitation of constituencies for district seats in the future Bangsamoro Parliament.</a></p>
<p><a id="421" name="421">This question has created considerable interest among political circles and is subject to continuing consultations.</a></p>
<p><a id="422" name="422">A law complementing the BEC to define parliamentary districting is expected by May 2024.</a></p>
<p><a id="423" name="423">The BTA Parliament on 17 August 2023 with unanimous support approved bills establishing eight municipalities comprising the 63 Special Geographic Area (SGA) barangays in North Cotabato province that had opted to join the BARMM during the 6 February 2019 plebiscite.</a></p>
<p><a id="424" name="424">As a result, the 63 barangays will be separated from their original municipalities in the towns of Pikit, Midsayap, Aleosan, Pigcawayan, Kabacan, and Carmen and constituted into independent municipalities.</a></p>
<p><a id="425" name="425">The new towns have been named Pahamuddin, Kadayangan, Nabalawag, Old Kaabakan, Kapalawan, Malidegao, Tugunan, and Ligawasan.</a></p>
<p><a id="426" name="426">The eight municipalities were set up under an Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) law (Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 18) which defines a minimum population requirement of 10,000.</a></p>

<p><a id="430" name="430">Ultimately, the aim would be to create a new province in the SGA which requires an act of Congress upon a request by the Bangsamoro Parliament.</a></p>

<p><a id="433" name="433">The creation of these new municipalities is therefore a positive and necessary step towards allowing SGA residents to perform their rights as citizens.</a></p>
<p><a id="434" name="434">The creation of the eight municipalities still needs to be approved by plebiscite.</a></p>
<p><a id="435" name="435">It will however not be possible to conduct a plebiscite in parallel with the barangay elections in October 2023 as COMELEC did not have sufficient time for preparations.</a></p>

<p><a id="439" name="439">Before its approval, the BLGC underwent eight public consultations from the regional to national levels and 23 days of deliberations at the committee level.</a></p>
<p><a id="440" name="440">One of the main issues raised during public consultations was a proposed anti-dynasty clause which caused resistance among political families.</a></p>
<p><a id="441" name="441">Discussion also included the powers of supervision the BARMM should have over its constituent LGUs.</a></p>
<p><a id="442" name="442">In a position paper dated 4 December 2022 the governors of the provinces of Sulu, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, and Basilan asserted that powers allotted to the BARMM under the BLGC overlap or supplant the President’s power of general supervision over LGUs.</a></p>
<p><a id="443" name="443">To counter these arguments the leading protagonists of the BLGC point out that the Code reflects that the Bangsamoro has a unique governmental setup in the Philippines.</a></p>
<p><a id="444" name="444">Its adoption is seen in the BARMM as an important milestone in pursuit of genuine and meaningful autonomy.</a></p>
<p><a id="445" name="445">Key points of the Code include, besides delineation of powers between regional and local governments, gradual devolution of powers to LGUs, mandatory training and capacity building for newly elected officials, creation of IP barangays within established ancestral domains and multisectoral representation in all levels of governance.</a></p>
<p><a id="446" name="446">During the amendments period in the plenary, the Bangsamoro Parliament retained "governance" instead of "government" in the Code to highlight citizen participation.</a></p>

<p><a id="530" name="530">These ceasefire coordination mechanisms have, since they entered into force, demonstrated their usefulness.</a></p>
<p><a id="531" name="531">It is a major success of the peace process that the ceasefire agreement has remained largely intact and the number of ceasefire violations has remained low following signature of the CAB.  </a></p>
<p><a id="532" name="532">According to GPH CCCH records, the number of GPH – MILF armed skirmishes has come down from peaks in 2002 (698), 2003 (589), 2008 (218) and 2009 (115) to 5 in 2021 and 1 in 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="533" name="533">45 ceasefire violations were recorded in 2022 and 2023 (up until 12 September 2023), the MILF was responsible for 42, the GPH for 3.</a></p>

<p><a id="535" name="535">One uncoordinated raid was listed for the GPH in 2023.</a></p>
<p><a id="536" name="536">The period from 2019 to mid-September 2023 has witnessed a total of 83 ceasefire protests (65 resolved, 10 proposed to be resolved, 8 unresolved).</a></p>
<p><a id="537" name="537">The IMT’s tour of duty came to an end on 30 June 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="538" name="538">The GPH did not extend its mandate, citing the low number of ceasefire violations which according to Manila had substantially diminished the IMT’s role.</a></p>
<p><a id="539" name="539">The MILF did not agree with this approach, referring to Item VIII/7 of the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro (FAB) which states that the IMT, along with CCCHs and AHJAGs shall continue to monitor the ceasefire agreement until the full decommissioning of MILF forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="540" name="540">Nonetheless the MILF signaled flexibility on reviewing the administrative details of the IMT’s Terms of Reference.</a></p>
<p><a id="541" name="541">Discussions on a compromise proposal based on an IMT with a more civilian orientation were launched by the Parties during the final months of the Duterte administration but did not result in a solution.</a></p>
<p><a id="542" name="542">In discussions with the TPMT, both Parties expressed appreciation on the work of CCCHs and AHJAGs in upholding the ceasefire and in coordinating law enforcement operations.</a></p>
<p><a id="543" name="543">To note though that MILF contacts describe coordination between the Parties as variable, depending on local circumstances and personalities involved.</a></p>
<p><a id="544" name="544">We understand that the coordination process often takes the form of blanket announcements by the GPH covering an extended period and a large number of barangays where security operations could occur.</a></p>
<p><a id="545" name="545">Many of our interlocutors in the BARMM expressed apprehension that non-specific coordination before carrying out security or law enforcement operations represents a risk of escalation with potentially detrimental effects for the peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="546" name="546">A police operation in Datu Paglas, Maguindanao on 18 June 2023 resulted in the death of seven members of the MILF.</a></p>
<p><a id="547" name="547">The PNP claimed that the seven victims were members of the extremist Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF).</a></p>

<p><a id="549" name="549">A joint investigation by the Parties did, however, not take place.</a></p>
<p><a id="550" name="550">The Datu Paglas incident has raised questions on the implementation of the ceasefire mechanisms.</a></p>
<p><a id="551" name="551">It prompted renewed calls by the MILF for the return of the IMT.</a></p>
<p><a id="552" name="552">This type of event has the potential to throw the peace process into jeopardy.</a></p>
<p><a id="553" name="553">Not only did it result in the temporary suspension of the decommissioning process, it is also seen by the MILF as a symptom of insecurity affecting their communities.</a></p>
<p><a id="554" name="554">Beyond that, it would appear that the TPMT EIGHTH PUBLIC REPORT              October 2023   
Page 31 of 62  absence of the IMT has resulted in lack of pressure to jointly resolve cases of ceasefire violations.</a></p>
<p><a id="555" name="555">The GPH is prepared to discuss a revitalization of the IMT at Panels level.</a></p>
<p><a id="556" name="556">There are however different perceptions among the Parties on the future ToR of the IMT.</a></p>
<p><a id="557" name="557">The position of the GPH is that posting active foreign military on Filipino soil is not in line with the Constitution.</a></p>
<p><a id="558" name="558">The GPH wants to see a predominantly civilian role for the IMT.</a></p>
<p><a id="559" name="559">The MILF, while prepared to show some flexibility, expects to see the return of the IMT also in a capacity which would allow it to comply with its originally defined function.</a></p>
<p><a id="560" name="560">This involves monitoring the ceasefire agreement and the possibility to carry out field verifications of security incidents.</a></p>
<p><a id="561" name="561">For this military expertise would be required in order to obtain optimal cooperation from those directly involved when working to resolve encounters.</a></p>
<p><a id="562" name="562">Beyond considering a return of the IMT, it would be useful for the Parties to review implementation of the ceasefire coordination mechanisms to avoid a repeat of incidents like the one which occurred in Datu Paglas.</a></p>
<p><a id="563" name="563">In particular, it should be discussed how to ensure prior coordination as outlined in relevant Implementing Guidelines linked to the GPH-MILF 1997 AGCH.</a></p>
<p><a id="564" name="564">These Guidelines call for effective coordination in advance of law enforcement operations conducted in MILF areas/communities to avoid unwanted firefights and hostilities.</a></p>
<p><a id="565" name="565">The TPMT calls on the Parties to follow these Guidelines meticulously in order to avoid possible setbacks to the peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="566" name="566">Furthermore, the TPMT encourages the Peace Implementing Panels to reengage in discussions to secure a renewed mandate for the IMT.</a></p>
<p><a id="567" name="567">While it is undisputed that the number of ceasefire violations between the Parties in recent years has been substantially reduced, the Datu Paglas incident has demonstrated that the presence of an impartial body would be helpful to maintain confidence in the peace process and is necessary to assess and validate violations should these occur.  </a></p>
<p><a id="568" name="568">Resource mobilization for normalization To recall that under the CAB, the Government of the Philippines committed itself to provide the necessary funding for the normalization process.</a></p>
<p><a id="569" name="569">The National Government established the Inter Cabinet Cluster Mechanism on Normalization (ICCMN) through Executive Order (EO)</a></p>
<p><a id="570" name="570">No. 79 in April 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="571" name="571">The ICCMN approach met with obstacles such as delays imposed by the pandemic and a reorientation of spending priorities, resulting in budget cuts by Congress of the originally planned allocations for normalization.  </a></p>
<p><a id="572" name="572">As we approach the end of the transition period, it is high time to come forward with a plan on how to speed up the implementation of the normalization process, provide it with adequate resources and bring it to a successful conclusion.  </a></p>
<p><a id="573" name="573">There is increasing pressure on the Bangsamoro Government to contribute to funding the normalization process through the block grant.</a></p>
<p><a id="574" name="574">While the Bangsamoro Government signaled some flexibility, for instance on provision of housing to disadvantaged groups, such an TPMT EIGHTH PUBLIC REPORT              October 2023   
Page 32 of 62  approach has limitations as the block grant is meant to serve the entire BARMM without specific focus on MILF communities.</a></p>
<p><a id="575" name="575">Where unspent appropriations are carried over to future years, they are purpose-bound and cannot be spent on alternative tasks.</a></p>
<p><a id="576" name="576">There have also been calls to intensify local provision of socioeconomic development packages or services at provincial, municipal, and barangay levels as LGUs benefit from increased shares of internal revenue allotments as a result of the Mandanas-Garcia ruling.</a></p>
<p><a id="577" name="577">The challenge here is implementation capacity of the LGUs.</a></p>
<p><a id="578" name="578">Decommissioning and camps transformation are central to the implementation of the normalization track.</a></p>
<p><a id="579" name="579">These are complex tasks which require a high degree of coordination among the various contributors to the normalization process.</a></p>
<p><a id="580" name="580">Also required are management capacity as well as a realistic assessment of implementation capacity of the various players involved.</a></p>
<p><a id="581" name="581">Primarily this task lies with the Panels and the JNC.</a></p>
<p><a id="582" name="582">In this context, the TPMT takes note that concerted efforts have been launched under the Marcos administration to channel more resources into socioeconomic support for decommissioned combatants and camps transformation.</a></p>
<p><a id="583" name="583">The GPH vowed to fast-track the implementation of the normalization program at an ICCMN meeting on 10 August 2023.</a></p>
<p><a id="584" name="584">OPAPRU has been soliciting increased support from ICCMN member-agencies.</a></p>
<p><a id="585" name="585">A renewed focus on normalization is also reflected by TFDCC consultation rounds and planned visits to MILF camps by ICCMN members.  </a></p>
<p><a id="586" name="586">Based on commitments resulting from the CAB, the most plausible approach would be to ensure that allocations in support of normalization including socioeconomic packages for decommissioned combatants are included in the general appropriations of ICCMN implementing agencies and that this is systematically done over the next couple of years until all commitments have been fulfilled.</a></p>
<p><a id="587" name="587">Such appropriations should be based on updated needs assessments to form the basis for defining overall budgetary targets by agency.</a></p>
<p><a id="588" name="588">A Camps Transformation Plan (CTP) is in place which needs to be backed up with financial commitments.</a></p>
<p><a id="589" name="589">The Camps Transformation Investment Program (CTIP) is being refined with the intention to serve as a reference document for contributions by national agencies, the BARMM, LGUs, and donors.</a></p>
<p><a id="590" name="590">Under the BOL, a SDF allotment of PhP5 billion is provided annually for a 10-year period by the National Government to the Bangsamoro Government for the rebuilding, rehabilitation and development of its conflict-affected communities.</a></p>

<p><a id="619" name="619">The GPH has expressed concern that a high number of those already decommissioned were not actively serving members of the MILF Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF).</a></p>
<p><a id="620" name="620">For the fourth and final round the GPH would like to see an emphasis on decommissioning active BIAF.</a></p>
<p><a id="621" name="621">There have also been calls for the MILF to hand in a higher number of weapons.</a></p>
<p><a id="622" name="622">The MILF argues that with the signature of the peace agreements, their members are in essence no longer combatants.</a></p>
<p><a id="623" name="623">There is also a need to differentiate whether weapons are owned by the organization or individual members.</a></p>
<p><a id="624" name="624">It would be advisable for these issues to be addressed conclusively by the Parties before the launch of the final phase of decommissioning.</a></p>
<p><a id="625" name="625">It has become clear that implementation of the normalization track will extend beyond the end of the transition phase in 2025.</a></p>
<p><a id="626" name="626">Decommissioning is no longer regarded by all stakeholders as time bound as its successful conclusion also depends on delivery of other elements of the normalization process.</a></p>
<p><a id="627" name="627">Sensitive issues will need to be addressed by the Panels in a spirit of cooperation and mutual trust.</a></p>
<p><a id="628" name="628">Deliberation at Panel level including the work of the socioeconomic study committee are therefore of crucial importance for the continuation of the decommissioning process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="629" name="629">Camps transformation Under the CAB, the Parties agreed to set up joint task forces to assess the needs, plan appropriate programs and undertake necessary measures to transform six previously acknowledged MILF camps into peaceful and productive communities.</a></p>

<p><a id="638" name="638">Policing The CAB calls for the establishment of a professional police force for the Bangsamoro, civilian in character, accountable for its actions and responsible both to the Central Government and the Bangsamoro Government, and to the communities it serves.</a></p>
<p><a id="639" name="639">An Independent Commission on Policing (ICP) was set up to recommend appropriate policing for the Bangsamoro.</a></p>
<p><a id="640" name="640">The ICP submitted its report in April 2014 which placed emphasis on community policing.</a></p>
<p><a id="641" name="641">To note that policing plays a central role for the successful completion of the peace process as well as in relation to other elements of the normalization process.</a></p>
<p><a id="642" name="642">It is in particular linked to phasing out transitional mechanisms including the Joint Peace and Security Teams (JPSTs) and to decommissioning of MILF combatants.</a></p>
<p><a id="643" name="643">According to the Annex on Normalization, agreed policing in the Bangsamoro should be constituted and operationalized before the launch of the final phase of decommissioning.</a></p>
<p><a id="644" name="644">To recall that under the CAB, public order and safety was defined as a concurrent power, this was however revised under the BOL to become a power of the national government.</a></p>
<p><a id="645" name="645">In consequence NAPOLCOM issued Resolution No. 2019-634 on 24 September 2019 establishing the PNP Police Regional Office Bangsamoro Autonomous Region (PRO BAR).</a></p>
<p><a id="646" name="646">The GPH expects the MILF to accept that police will remain a national competence as stipulated in the BOL.</a></p>
<p><a id="647" name="647">The MILF however believes that the policing provisions in the BOL are not in line with the spirit of what was negotiated under the CAB.</a></p>
<p><a id="648" name="648">This implies that there is no agreement yet between the Parties on the final shape of policing in the Bangsamoro.</a></p>
<p><a id="649" name="649">Nonetheless the Bangsamoro Government has established good working relations with the PRO BAR.</a></p>

<p><a id="654" name="654">The TWG has been working on recommendations to accommodate eligible graduates to allow them to join the PNP.</a></p>
<p><a id="655" name="655">Initially a number of 5060 was under consideration, reportedly the national leftover quota for the years 2021 and 2022, but there was no practical follow-up.</a></p>

<p><a id="660" name="660">Actual police recruitment started in June 2023.</a></p>
<p><a id="661" name="661">Out of those who passed the NSQE 1,134 applicants were initially screened for qualification into 400 available slots for 2023.</a></p>

<p><a id="664" name="664">Starting from 9 September a further 693 applicants are undergoing physical agility tests or psychological and psychiatric exams with the intention to fill the 400 slots within this year.</a></p>
<p><a id="665" name="665">The BARMM contributes funding to the training of recruits.</a></p>
<p><a id="666" name="666">The BOL under Article XI, Section 2 mandates a five-year waiver period of age, height, and education requirements to facilitate entry of MNLF and MILF members into the police force.</a></p>
<p><a id="667" name="667">The waiver formally expires in January 2024 five years after the ratification of the BOL.</a></p>
<p><a id="668" name="668">Extending the period on entry requirements might require an amendment to the BOL unless a flexible solution is found.</a></p>
<p><a id="669" name="669">As recruitment of MILF and MNLF into the police force started much later than originally anticipated, it would be logical for the waiver provision to be extended so that it would not be an obstacle to appropriate recruitment into the PNP.</a></p>
<p><a id="670" name="670">There remains uncertainty in the BARMM on how many MILF and MNLF can ultimately be accommodated.</a></p>
<p><a id="671" name="671">Recruitment quotas for the following years still need to be determined.</a></p>
<p><a id="672" name="672">The Bangsamoro Government would favour a special quota and a considerable increase in numbers;</a></p>
<p><a id="673" name="673">however, it is not evident whether this can be accommodated.</a></p>
<p><a id="674" name="674">Not significantly raising the quota will likely result in considerable frustration among those who have successfully passed the NSQE exam and may not be offered a position.</a></p>
<p><a id="675" name="675">There still remain other open questions in relation to policing in the Bangsamoro.</a></p>
<p><a id="676" name="676">So far not even the existing law is being followed, as the Chief Minister of the BARMM was not consulted during appointments of the Chief of the PNP PRO BAR in line with RA No. 6975.  </a></p>
<p><a id="677" name="677">The MILF looks at current arrangements as an intermediate solution and would like to bring its preferred concept of a Bangsamoro police back on the table, if necessary by reopening the questions on constitutionality of policing.</a></p>
<p><a id="678" name="678">At a minimum, efforts should be made to work towards a version of community-based policing in the Bangsamoro on the basis of ICP recommendations and what is feasible under the current framework.</a></p>
<p><a id="679" name="679">A suitable strategic approach should be agreed among the Parties at the earliest.</a></p>
<p><a id="680" name="680">Joint Peace and Security Teams (JPSTs)</a></p>
<p><a id="681" name="681">The CAB specifies that contingents from AFP, PNP and BIAF shall be organized into JPSTs to work for maintenance of peace and order and the stability of areas mutually identified by GPH and MILF.</a></p>
<p><a id="682" name="682">JPSTs are also engaged in preventing hostilities and supporting dispute resolution.</a></p>
<p><a id="683" name="683">The fact that representatives from the BIAF, the PNP and the AFP cooperate as one unit in harmony is in itself a very important accomplishment of the peace process.</a></p>

<p><a id="706" name="706">The CAB calls on the JNC to develop a program for reduction and management of small arms and light weapons (SALWs) of individuals and groups.</a></p>
<p><a id="707" name="707">The JNC has carried out preparatory work in this respect for discussion by the Panels.</a></p>
<p><a id="708" name="708">This is an important step in acknowledging that there are other, privately-owned weapons apart from those under the decommissioning process which need to be dealt with under a parallel approach.</a></p>
<p><a id="709" name="709">According to information provided by the GPH, as a result of provincial SALW programs 1,159 weapons from Basilan, Tawi-Tawi, and Maguindanao were turned in by September 2023, whereas 4,346 were stenciled.</a></p>
<p><a id="710" name="710">The Japan-funded Assistance for Security, Peace, Integration, and Recovery for Advanced Human Security in the BARMM (ASPIRE) Program was launched on 5 October 2023 in four pilot areas of Basilan, SGA BARMM, Maguindanao del Norte, and Maguindanao del Sur as a SALW control project.</a></p>

<p><a id="713" name="713">Many in the BARMM are convinced that genuine peace in the region and true healing can only be achieved by addressing historical injustices committed against the Bangsamoro people, including human rights violations, land dispossession and marginalization.</a></p>
<p><a id="714" name="714">Under the CAB, the Parties agreed to create a Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) to undertake a study and to recommend to the Panels the appropriate mechanisms for TJR.  </a></p>
<p><a id="715" name="715">The TJRC issued its recommendations back in 2016, central among which is to set up a National Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission for the Bangsamoro (NTJRCB) as a dedicated body at national level to oversee a National Dealing with the Past Strategy.</a></p>
<p><a id="716" name="716">The need for a national approach to address the legitimate grievances of the Bangsamoro is supported by the fact that many human rights violations took place outside the BARMM.</a></p>
<p><a id="717" name="717">An example is the Malisbong massacre, the mass killing of Muslim Moros by government forces inside a mosque in September 1974 which took place in Palimbang municipality, Sultan Kudarat province.</a></p>
<p><a id="718" name="718">A regional BARMM approach on TJR could be interpreted as failing to properly confront the full range of historical injustices.</a></p>
<p><a id="719" name="719">The BTA through a resolution called on the National Government to create a NTJRCB and to implement related programmes.</a></p>
<p><a id="720" name="720">The TJR process has followed two tracks.</a></p>

<p><a id="772" name="772">Residents of island provinces nevertheless expressed the wish for stronger representation in the BTA and more responsiveness to local issues of concern.</a></p>

<p><a id="776" name="776">Moros outside the BARMM During TPMT visits to MILF communities outside the BARMM in Zamboanga Sibugay, Sarangani, and Sultan Kudarat provinces, residents conveyed sentiments of isolation.</a></p>
<p><a id="777" name="777">They stressed the need for better infrastructure, enhanced economic opportunities and access to social services.</a></p>
<p><a id="778" name="778">Residents also complained about a general feeling of administrative neglect, insecurity, and harassments by authorities.</a></p>

<p><a id="785" name="785">The core of Marawi, the country’s and the BARMM’s only majority Islamic City, was destroyed during five months of urban warfare between government troops and Islamic State-aligned militants which lasted from May to October 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="786" name="786">The Marawi siege resulted in more than 1,200 persons killed and an estimated 350,000 persons displaced.</a></p>

<p><a id="789" name="789">The siege of Marawi took place after the peace agreements were concluded.</a></p>
<p><a id="790" name="790">The MILF cooperated with security forces in setting up peace corridors to facilitate delivery of relief goods and to evacuate civilians trapped in the war zone.</a></p>
<p><a id="791" name="791">Some observers believe that the Marawi siege served as encouragement to speed up implementation of the peace process by placing renewed emphasis on adoption of the Bangsamoro Organic Law.</a></p>
<p><a id="792" name="792">The national government took charge of the city’s reconstruction through the Task Force Bangon Marawi (TFBM) with focus on development of infrastructure and public utilities, including mosques, a new conference center and a sports stadium.</a></p>
<p><a id="793" name="793">During TPMT visits to Marawi City we noticed some impressive achievements, the reconstructed Grand Mosque being one example.  </a></p>
<p><a id="794" name="794">But it has also become clear that six years after the siege the rehabilitation of Marawi City is far from complete, as large parts of residential areas in the Most Affected Area (MAA), where the heaviest fighting took place, remain in ruins and off-limits to displaced residents.</a></p>
<p><a id="795" name="795">Priority efforts need to be placed on facilitating the return of residents to the MAA, including support to reconstruction for damaged properties and/or compensation.</a></p>
<p><a id="796" name="796">According to civil society representatives at least 5,000 families are still living in temporary shelters.</a></p>
<p><a id="797" name="797">This has left many among those affected frustrated and disillusioned.</a></p>
<p><a id="798" name="798">Permanent housing units which have been constructed could only accommodate a small part of displaced residents.</a></p>

<p><a id="806" name="806">The initial allocation for 2023 under the Marawi Siege Victims’ Compensation Act amounted to PhP1 billion.</a></p>
<p><a id="807" name="807">According to the MCB Chair, 4,762 claimants have submitted applications during July and August for a total amount of PhP17 billion.</a></p>
<p><a id="808" name="808">This would represent just 19% of the estimated 23,500 claimants.</a></p>
