<p><a id="4" name="4">Monitoring Team issues its fourth annual Public Report  
Notes developme nts during the transition from the Aquino to the Duterte administration , and 
highlights the need to legislate a CAB -compliant Bangsamoro Basic Law to combat violent 
extremis m and attain sustainable peace .

<p><a id="5" name="5">The Third -Party Monitoring Team (TPMT), formally established in 2013 as part of the peace 
process between the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, today 
issued its fourth annual Public Report.  
  
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">International TPMT member Huseyin Oruc said that “the period of transition from  the 
administration of President Benigno S. Aquino III to that of  President Rodrigo Roa Duterte 
has seen some  continuity  but also change in the roadmap for implementation o f</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">the 
Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB).</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">Despite the failure of the 16th Congress 
to pass the Bangsamoro  Basic Law (BBL) , the first  year  under the new administration  began 
with optimism  for peace as President Duterte had reiterated his campaign promise to bring 
peace to Mindanao and support the BBL .”</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9"> 
 
Mr. Oruc  cited  the two most important developments in the past year that greatly impact the 
peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">One, the  positive development  of the completed drafting  by the expanded and 
more inclusive Bangsamoro Transition Commission of a draft BBL, which was submitted in 
time for the President’s State of the Nation Address and cited as a priority bill  both by the 
House of Representatives and  for the Senate;</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">and two, the recent and still o ngoing  tragic crisis 
in Marawi, that manifests the growing threat of violent extremism.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">   
  
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">Local TPMT member Mr. Rahib  Kudto  noted other key developments in the peace process, 
including the Duterte  administration’s new two -track approach in the legislation of both the 
Bangsamoro Basic Law and Federalism, as well as efforts  on  greater inclusivity and 
convergence  that includes various MNLF groups like the one led by Nur Misuari.   
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">Nevertheless, Mr.  Kudto stressed the need to pass a CAB -complaint BBL that will reflect the 
aspirations of the Bangsamoro people.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">The failure to pass the BBL in the previous 
administration deepened frustration among the people and more youths became attracted to 
violent ex tremism, leading to the rise of terrorist groups like the Maute group.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">Another failure 
to pass this important legislation could mean worse for the peace process and the already 
volatile situation in Mindanao.

 Another TPMT local member Karen Ta ñada concl uded that “with the positive developments 
as well as threats, the peace process could be on the verge of a breakthrough ,  on condition  
that the twin challenges of  completing  BBL legislation, and combating violent extremism,  
can be effectively  addressed .”</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">She added that the TPMT remains confident that peace can be 
attained, as the dire situation in Marawi  highlights how the Philippines cannot afford to ignore 
the costs of conflict.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">“As the fighting subsides, it should be clear  that  a compre hensive approach that addresses  the 
Bangsamoro aspirations by installing a Bangsamoro government  exercising the fullest 
autonomy  is the path to sustainable peace ,” she pointed out.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">Tañada stressed that “the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro , which is the product 
of 17 years of difficult negotiation as the other form of struggle for self -determination,  remains 
the cornerstone of peace.”</a></p>

Background  
  
The independent Third -Party</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">Monitoring Team (TPMT) was set up by the Government of the 
Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front to monitor the implementation of the GPH -
MILF peace agreement, as provided for in the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro (FAB) 
signed on 15 October 2012.  
  
</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">The TMPT is supposed to have at least five mem bers (two nominated by the GPH, two by the MILF,

<p><a id="25" name="25">Currently, there are four members:</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">the local members are Karen

the Philippines, now retired).</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">Former international member Steven Rood (The Asia Foundation) 
left the TPMT in February 2017, and the Government Panel has yet to nominate his replacement 
(to be agreed by the MILF).   
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The TPMT is tasked with monitoring, reviewing and assessing the implementation of all signed 
agreements between the Parties, primarily the FAB and its Annexes.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">In particular, its basic 
functions are to :</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">- monitor and evaluate the implementation of all agreements;</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32"> 
- review and assess the progress of the implementation of commitments by both Parties under 
the Agreements (submitting comprehensive periodic reports and updates to both Parties for 
their appropriate action);</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33"> 
- and to communicate to the public the progress and developments in the implementation of the 
Agreements of the Parties.  
  
</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">The TPMT was launched in July of 2013, on the basis of the Terms of Reference agreed by the 
Parties in January of that year.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The TPMT has so far convened twenty -three times in the 
Philippines, on a roughly two -monthly basis, and will continue its work through until the 
completion of the Exit Document foreseen in the FAB.  
  
</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">The present Public Report is the fourth such report issued by the TPMT (previous reports were 
issued in February 2014, February 2015 and February 2016).  </a></p>
