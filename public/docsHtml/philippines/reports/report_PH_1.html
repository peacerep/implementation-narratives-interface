<p><a id="10" name="10">Summary  
In line with the Terms of Reference of the Third Party Monitoring Team (TPMT), this seventh 
public report is intended to provide an overall assessm ent of developments in the 
implementation of the peace agreements concluded between the Government of the Philippines 
(GPH) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">The agreements comprise the 
Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) and the Fr amework Agreement on the 
Bangsamoro (FAB) including its Annexes.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">This report covers the period from November 2020 
to January 2022, continuing from the sixth public report on the period March 2019 to October 
2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">The constitution of the Bangsamoro Autonomo us Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) as 
an autonomous political entity in early 2019 provided opportunities for meaningful self -
governance in the Bangsamoro (see TPMT 6th Public Report).</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">Implementation of the peace 
process saw steady progress but was slowe d down by two factors:</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">the continued impact of the 
COVID -19 pandemic which delayed consultative processes and program delivery, and debate 
over the extension of the transition phase in the Philippine Congress which absorbed much of 
the attention of the Par ties during the reporting period.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">Republic Act (RA) No. 11593 resetting the first regular elections in the BARMM from 2022 
to 2025 and amending Section 13, Article XVI of RA</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">No. 11054, the Bangsamoro Organic 
Law (BOL), was signed into law by President Dute rte on 28 October 2021, thus ending an 
extended period of legal uncertainty.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">RA 11593 leaves Section 2, Article XVI of the BOL in 
place which states that the MILF shall lead the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA).</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">Earlier, on 17 November 2020, the BTA Parliament had issued Resolution No. 93 urging 
Congress to extend the transition period, citing the sheer weight of its mandate coupled with 
shortfalls in resources, continued security threats and the effects of a ling ering pandemic.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">The reporting period witnessed several key achievements.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">In as far as the political track is 
concerned, a substantial part of the legislative task has been completed.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">T hree priority codes 
have now been  adopted , including two  during the rep orting period, the Bangsamoro Civil 
Service Code on 24 February 2021 and the Bangsamoro Education Code on 18 May 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">Intergovernmental relations (IGR) are managed formally through systematic interaction 
between the National Government in Manila and the B ARMM Government in Cotabato, with 
the Intergovernmental Relations Body (IGRB) meeting on a regular basis for two years since 
its first consultative meeting in December 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">However, two sub -mechanisms, the Philippine 
Congress - Bangsamoro Parliament Forum  (PCBPF) and the Bangsamoro Sustainable 
Development Board (BSDB) have not yet been activated.  </a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">TPMT  SEVENTH PUBLIC REPORT              January 2022   
Page 4 of 41 
 Among the milestones in IGR for this period is the transfer of Cotabato City into BARMM 
administrative structures which took effect on 15 December 2020 and the tr ansfer of 
management of existing nature reserves and protected areas by the Department of Environment 
and Natural Resources (DENR) to the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources, and 
Energy (MENRE) on 17 December 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">The Department of Public Works and  Highways 
(DPWH) also formally turned over the Cotabato City District Engineering Office (CCDEO) to 
the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) on 20 September 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">The National Commission on 
Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) and the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples Affairs  (MIPA) also 
entered into a Memorandum of Cooperation on 5 November 2021 for the protection and 
promotion of the rights and well -being of indigenous peoples (IPs) in the BARMM.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">On the normalization track, the third phase of the decommissioning process comm enced on 8 
November 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">During this phase, a total of 14,000 combatants and 2,450 weapons of the 
MILF will be decommissioned.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">However, questions related to the provision of socio -economic 
packages for decommissioned combatants still need to be resolved.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">There is no agreement yet 
on defining guidelines for entry of MILF and Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) 
members into the Philippine National Police (PNP).</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">Key recommendations put forward by the 
Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC)  have not yet been addressed.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">Other achievements in the normalization process are the completion of training of 20 Joint 
Peace and Security Teams (JPSTs) out of which 14 teams have been deployed, the continued 
roll-out of actions on disbanding private arme d groups (PAGs) in the BARMM as well as 
neighbouring provinces, and implementation of a program for the reduction and management 
of small arms and light weapons (SALWs).</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">We note progress on Confidence -building Measures (CBMs).</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">President Duterte signed 
Proclamation No. 1090 on granting amnesty to members of the MILF on 5 February 2021 
together with Executive Order (EO)</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">No. 125 creating the National Amnesty Commission 
(NAC).</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">The House of Representatives endorsed the provisions in May 2021, while the Senate 
adopted the House resolution in January 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">The Camps Transformation Plan (CTP) and its 
Camps Transformation Investment Program (CTIP) was approved by the GPH and the MILF 
Peace Implementing Panels on 9 November 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">To ensure resource mobilization for 
normalization, the Bangsamoro Normalization Trust Fund (BNTF) was launched on 19 May 
2021.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">A Marawi Compensation Bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 6 September 
2021 and by the Senate on 31 January 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">With the extension now in place, the P arties have the opportunity to focus on completing the 
peace process with less time pressure.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">However, with several dimensions of the peace process 
still at an initial implementation stage there is no room for complacency.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">It is essential for the 
Parties t o embrace the added time as an opportunity to revitalize the peace process and to 
address the remaining tasks with renewed vigour.  </a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">TPMT  SEVENTH PUBLIC REPORT              January 2022   
Page 5 of 41 
 Looking forward, and before the extension takes effect, the TPMT encourages the following 
steps to consolidate the implementa tion of the peace process:</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">● Adopt priority legislations within the originally defined timeframe prior to June 2022;</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56"> 
● proceed with defining an IP law, which should be informed by results of wide public 
consultations, involving the main stakeholders;</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57"> 
● use the I GRB to methodically address pending issues and proceed with the 
operationalization of remaining IGR mechanisms;</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">● address perspective viewpoints in advancing on the normalization track as soon as 
possible so that these would not be passed to the next Adminis tration;</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">● ensure swift and efficient implementation of the Amnesty provisions through the 
National Amnesty Commission;</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">● strive for greater security and prevention of violent incidents, whether involving rido, 
resource conflicts or extremism, through holistic  and strategic measures.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">  
</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">With the extension of the transition period now in place and beyond the assessment of the 
reporting period, the TPMT believes that this is an appropriate time to look at the fundamentals 
of the peace agreements from a broader per spective, to assess what has been achieved and to 
record what remains to be done, also in view of a new Administration taking over by mid -2022. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">This report therefore provides a more comprehensive analysis of the current state of 
implementation of the peace  agreements in the concluding Comments section.

<p><a id="506" name="506">Comment  
The TPMT believes that the peace agreements, the CAB and the FAB, represent a historic 
achievement by laying out a comprehensive framework in addressing the complex origins of 
the Bangsamoro cause with the aim of precluding the possibility of armed hostilities  once and 
for all.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="507" name="507">The agreements combine and counterbalance two fundamental concepts:</a></p>
<p><a id="508" name="508">on the one hand the 
idea of meaningful self -governance for the Bangsamoro, as expressed in the establishment of 
the BARMM as a political entity, on the other hand the gr adual normalization of conflict -
affected areas and their transformation into peaceful and progressive communities.</a></p>
<p><a id="509" name="509">This 
approach is reflected in the two pillars which support the implementation of the agreements - 
the political track and the normalization track.</a></p>
<p><a id="510" name="510">Both tracks should complement and reinforce 
each other.</a></p>
<p><a id="511" name="511">The CAB commits both Parties to nurture the integrity of the whole peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="512" name="512"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="513" name="513">The ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) through a plebiscite on 21 January 
2019 created the BARMM as a legal political entity by defining its basic structure of 
government, including for the transition period.</a></p>
<p><a id="514" name="514">While several important CAB provisions have 
been removed from the BOL or were amended (see TPMT 5th Public Report), both CAB and 
BOL share the s ame objectives of achieving lasting peace on the basis of justice, as well as 
genuine and meaningful self -governance for the Bangsamoro.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="515" name="515">The BOL was conceived as a piece of legislation to implement the peace agreements.</a></p>
<p><a id="516" name="516">It cannot 
replace or substitute the agreements which remain in force until an exit agreement is concluded 
and signed by the two Parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="517" name="517">The agreements therefore continue to form the basis for assessing 
whether the objectives of the peace process have been delivered.</a></p>
<p><a id="518" name="518"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="519" name="519">As the peace process ent ered its advanced implementation stage following the inaugural 
session of the BTA on 29 March 2019, it soon became evident that the allocated 3 -year 
timeframe in the BOL for establishing a new autonomous political entity was very ambitious. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="520" name="520">The complexity of the task of establishing a new political and administrative entity was 
significant.</a></p>
<p><a id="521" name="521">The constraints imposed by the COVID -19 pandemic added considerably to this 
challenge.</a></p>
<p><a id="522" name="522"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="523" name="523">The extension of the transition phase until 2025, if used judiciously, will give the BTA more 
time to accomplish its priority tasks.</a></p>
<p><a id="524" name="524"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="525" name="525">The extension will also allow the Parties - the GPH and the MILF, more space to complete 
what they originally committed to  achieve.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="526" name="526">A lot of time has passed since the peace agreements were negotiated.</a></p>
<p><a id="527" name="527">This is a good time to 
assess what has been accomplished and what remains to be done, and to reflect on commitments 
at this point.  </a></p>

<p><a id="535" name="535">The foundations for effective administrative and 
legislative structures in the Bangsamoro, including the adoption of priority legislation 
and institution building, have been laid.</a></p>
<p><a id="536" name="536">This in itself is an outstanding achievem ent. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="537" name="537">● The IGRB continues to meet on a regular basis, thereby assuring regular interaction 
between the National Government in Manila and the BARMM Government in 
Cotabato.</a></p>
<p><a id="538" name="538">The IGRB has become an irreplaceable element in defining the working 
arrangements betwe en the two governments.</a></p>
<p><a id="539" name="539"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="540" name="540">● Some important and long -awaited steps were taken in advancing the normalization 
agenda, in particular the start of  the 3rd round of decommissioning, the release of an 
Amnesty Proclamation and the launching of the Bangsamoro Normaliz ation Trust Fund 
(BNTF).</a></p>
<p><a id="541" name="541"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="542" name="542">At the same time, we observe several  challenges  in important areas of the peace process:</a></p>
<p><a id="543" name="543"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="544" name="544">● While achievements on the political track to date are impressive, the BOL includes a 
large unfinished agenda of legislative, institutional and administrative tasks.</a></p>
<p><a id="545" name="545">Beyond 
the need for the BTA to complete the work on the priority codes these comprise 
expanding the revenue capacity of the BARMM, organizing the bureaucracy, building 
the justice system, protecting and managing natu ral resources as well as accelerated 
development efforts, including for conflict -affected and poverty -stricken communities. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="546" name="546">These tasks should be tackled with energy and determination.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="547" name="547">● While the BOL provides the framework for advancing on the political tra ck, 
implementation of the normalization track is comparatively behind schedule.</a></p>
<p><a id="548" name="548">Unless 
addressed proactively, the integrity of the peace process risks drifting into a state of 
imbalance.</a></p>
<p><a id="549" name="549"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="550" name="550">● The decommissioning of MILF combatants represents the most important component 
of the normalization track.</a></p>
<p><a id="551" name="551">Thanks to the determination of both Parties and the 
professionalism of the IDB the decommissioning process  advanced despite the fact that 
little progress was made in other areas of normalization.</a></p>
<p><a id="552" name="552">For instance, this rel ates to the 
absence of agreed policing, lack of clarity on socio -economic packages for 
decommissioned combatants, and slow progress on camps transformation.</a></p>
<p><a id="553" name="553">Ultimately TPMT  SEVENTH PUBLIC REPORT              January 2022   
Page 28 of 41 
 progress on decommissioning will remain dependent on other elements of the 
normalization  track being pursued in parallel.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="554" name="554">● There has been little movement when it comes to implementing the key 
recommendations of the TJRC.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="555" name="555">● Partly as a result of the pandemic, implementation of programs in the BARMM, 
including in the field of normalization, was af fected by reorientation of priorities 
resulting in a shortage of funds.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="556" name="556">● Finally, we note a tendency for the GPH to act unilaterally without involving the 
BARMM where this would be pertinent.</a></p>
<p><a id="557" name="557">This applies in particular to the security field. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="558" name="558">Examples are EO  79 which presents normalization as something the national 
Government will do for the Bangsamoro, rather than with the Bangsamoro, or failure 
to consult the Chief Minister on the appointment of the Bangsamoro police chief.</a></p>
<p><a id="559" name="559"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="560" name="560">As the peace process enters its f inal and decisive phase, the TPMT is of the view that the 
following aspects should be considered  to ensure a successful outcome:</a></p>
<p><a id="561" name="561"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="562" name="562">● It is imperative for the Parties to continue to demonstrate the commitment, perseverance

</a></p>
<p><a id="565" name="565">● A peace process is always evolving.</a></p>
<p><a id="566" name="566">The additional three years allowed for peace 
process implementation provide an opportunity for joi nt reflection on the achievements 
to this point, and perhaps an opportunity to adjust and refine the way the peace process 
is implemented on the basis of the existing agreements.</a></p>
<p><a id="567" name="567">This reflective process can start 
now.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="568" name="568">● Completing the BTA legislative priorit ies is important to signal to the public that the 
new Parliament structure works and must serve as a clear demonstration that the 
political process is on track.</a></p>
<p><a id="569" name="569">Therefore, it is vital that the outstanding priority codes 
should be passed by the current BTA within the originally determined timeframe.</a></p>
<p><a id="570" name="570"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="571" name="571">● Implementation of the normalization track as a key element of the peace process has 
proven to be difficult and sensitive.</a></p>
<p><a id="572" name="572">It has been carried forward more slowly than
