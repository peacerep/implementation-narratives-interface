<p><a id="0" name="0">  The situation in eastern Ukraine remained tense with the SMM initially registering a slight 
fall and then a subsequent increase in the level of ceasefire violations over the last two 
weeks.  The  violence  was  concentrated  around  the  Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-Donetsk  airport 
area, areas east and north-east of Mariupol, the area south-west, south and south-east of 
Svitlodarsk,  the  western,  south-western  and  northern  outskirts  of  Horlivka,  and  around 
Popasna-Pervomaisk.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  recorded  use  of  weapons  that  should  have  been  withdrawn  under  the  Minsk     

agreements  increased  almost  four-fold  between  31  July  and  6  August  (547  instances) 
compared  to  the  week  before  (137  instances).  SMM  monitors  regularly  reported  on   
damage to civilian houses due to shelling. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  Three  civilians  were  killed  and  ten  injured  from  24  July  to  8  August,  bringing  the  total 
number of civilian casualties confirmed by the SMM in 2017 to 345, including 62 fatalities.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  In  order  to  contribute  to  improving  the  humanitarian  situation  for  civilians,  between 
24 July and 8 August the SMM facilitated and monitored “windows of silence” to enable 
repairs at a number of infrastructural facilities in Luhansk region, namely the power plant 
in  Shchastia,  the  pumping  station  in  Artema,  the  Zolote-Popasna  water  pipeline,  water 
wells in Krasnyi Lyman, and the Mykhailivka-Lysychansk high voltage power lines.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  The Mission’s freedom of movement continued to be restricted. Apart from restrictions 
related to the lack of mine action by the sides, access for SMM patrols was impeded on 
numerous occasions, particularly in the non-government controlled areas in the southern 
part of Donetsk region. Notably, between 24 July and 8 August,  armed members of the  
so-called “DPR” prevented the SMM from proceeding east from an entry-exit checkpoint 
in Verkhnoshyrokivske (formerly Oktiabr) ten times. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  On 3 August, the SMM experienced violence while monitoring the installation of an SMM 
camera on the roof of the office building at the Donetsk Filtration Station. Small-arms fire 
in  the  direction  of  SMM-contracted  workers  and  SMM  monitors  forced  them  to  take  
cover  and  suspend  work  for  the  day.  The  small-arms  fire  occurred  despite  security      
guarantees provided by the sides.
