<p><a id="0" name="0">  On 21 July, a recommitment to the ceasefire – agreed by the Trilateral Contact Group on 17 July – came into effect, after which there was a considerable fall-off in the number of recorded ceasefire violations.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  Between 15 and 28 July, the SMM recorded over 6,000 ceasefire violations (compared with almost 14,000 in the previous two-week period). Over 75 percent of ceasefire viola-tions were recorded in the first six days of the reporting period, prior to the recommit-ment coming into effect.  In the days following the recommitment coming into effect, while most areas remained calm,  the  level  of  violence  remained  high  in  three  areas,  including  the  Popasna-Pervomaisk-Zolote area of Luhansk region. The security situation in the Stanytsia Luhanska disengagement area has remained calm since  the  Mission  noted  the  beginning  of  the  disengagement  of  forces  and  hardware there on 26 June.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  Mission  facilitated  access  for  engineers  from  government-controlled  areas  to  the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge in order to conduct a joint technical assessment of the bridge with engineers from non-government-controlled areas. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The SMM confirmed that four civilians were killed and 13 were injured. This brings the total number of civilian casualties since 1 January 2019 to 98 (14 deaths and 84 injuries). No civilian casualties were recorded since the recommitment came into effect. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMM observed  damage caused by  small-arms fire and shelling to civilian  property and infrastructure in numerous locations along the contact line; all prior to the start of the recommitment to the ceasefire. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The Mission observed 178 weapons in violation of the agreed withdrawal lines (143 in areas  not  controlled  by  the  Government),  as  well  as  mines  and  unexploded  ordnance (UXO). In addition to restrictions posed by mines and UXO, the SMM’s freedom of movement was restricted 44 times; all in non-government-controlled areas.
