<p><a id="0" name="0">  The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) continued to monitor the security 
situation, noting that it remained highly volatile, unpredictable and highly tense 
with  occasional  flare-ups.  The  Donetsk  airport-Yasynuvata-Avdiivka  triangle   
remained  the  epicentre  of  violence.  The  level  of  violence  in  Luhansk  region    
remained  relatively  low  with  some  isolated  spikes  in  ceasefire  violations          
occurring in Stanytsia Luhanska area and in parts of western Luhansk region.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The SMM continued to note the presence of the risk factors such as weapons in 

violation  of  withdrawal  lines,  and  armed  forces  and  formations  positioned      
dangerously close to one another. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement process in the general areas 
of  Stanytsia  Luhanska,  Zolote/Pervomaisk  and  Petrivske/Bohdanivka  through 
patrolling and remote observation, as foreseen in the Framework Decision of the 
Trilateral  Contact  Group  relating  to  disengagement  of  forces  and  hardware  of 
21 September 2016. The SMM has noted some hardware and personnel moving 
away from the contact line.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  At  the  same  time,  however,  monitors  still  lack  unfettered  access  to  the  three 
disengagement areas with the sides having failed to remove mines or the Joint 
Centre for Control and Co-ordination failing to facilitate their removal.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  Addressing  the  OSCE  Permanent  Council  on  5  October,  Chief  Monitor  Ertugrul 
Apakan  said  that  disengagement  is  a  key  step  towards  a  full  and  sustainable 
ceasefire in Ukraine and that more needs to be done to make it a reality on the 
ground. Read at: www.osce.org/cio/272236

<p><a id="5" name="5">  Overall,  the  SMMâ€™s  freedom  of  movement  continues  to  be  restricted,              

particularly  in  areas  not  controlled  by  the  Government.    On  7  October  a  man 
threatened  monitors  at  the  SMM  camera  site  at  Oktiabr  mine.  Read  more:
