<p><a id="0" name="0">  For  the  eighth  week  in  a  row,  the  security  situation  remains  relatively  calm  following additional measures to strengthen the ceasefire, which took effect on 27 July. Between 7 and 20 September, the SMM recorded 120 ceasefire violations, compared with 254 in the previous two-week period. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The SMM continued monitoring the security situation in and around the three pilot dis-engagement  areas,  recording  no  ceasefire  violations  but  noting  again  the  regular  pres-ence of people within, or close to, former military and military-type positions inside the areas near Zolote and Petrivske.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  On 15 September, during regular maintenance, the SMM saw that its camera near Bere-zove was disconnected from its power supply and the system was operating on a backup power supply (see Spot Report 39/2020). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  Mission  corroborated  reports  of  six  civilian  casualties  –  including  one  fatality  –  re-sulting from the detonation of explosive objects. This brings the total number of civilian casualties since the beginning of 2020 to 70: 10 fatalities and 60 injuries. For the eighth consecutive  week,  the  Mission  received  no  reports  of  civilian  casualties  or  damage  to civilian properties due to shelling or small-arms fire. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMM continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to enable repairs to and maintenance of critical civilian infrastructure. This included repairs to wa-ter  infrastructure  near  Pankivka  and  Zolote-5/Mykhailivka,  providing  water  to  about 150,000 people on both sides of the contact line. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the SMM continued to note reduced numbers of civilians crossing  the  contact  line  at  Stanytsia  Luhanska  bridge  and  observed  that  some  civilians continued  to  stay  overnight  near  the  entry-exit  checkpoint  (EECP).  In  Donetsk  region, where  EECPs  remain  operational,  the  only  checkpoint  of  the  armed  formations  that  is operational  is  the  one  near  Olenivka  and  it  is  open  only  two  days  a  week,  resulting  in severely restricted movement and hardship for the civilian population amid deteriorating weather  conditions.  In  some  cases,  people  had  to  stay  overnight,  some  spending  their nights without shelter or adequate facilities, as they waited for permission to cross. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The Mission’s freedom of movement was restricted 34 times on the ground, all but two in non-government-controlled areas. SMM unmanned aerial vehicles experienced signal interference  assessed  as  caused  by  probable  jamming  on  17  occasions  while  flying  on both  sides  of  the  contact  line,  including  twice  over  the  disengagement  area  near Petrivske.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">  Crossing difficulties at the contact line continue to hinder the SMM’s monitoring of non-government-controlled areas.</a></p>
