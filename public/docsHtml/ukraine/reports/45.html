<p><a id="0" name="0"> The SMM noted a slight overall decrease in the level of violence in eastern 
Ukraine during the period from 26 June to 9 July. The situation, however, 
remained volatile, with violence erupting in a number of areas: SMM monitors 
at the Popasna forward patrol base recorded 100 mortar impacts around 
Popasna-Pervomaisk on 27 June, at least 50 artillery and 10 mortar rounds 
near Svitlodarsk on 28 June, and approximately 500 explosions in just three 
hours in Yasynuvata on 29 June.

<p><a id="1" name="1"> Continued violence and potential escalation remain as the sides, at best, only 
partially adhere to their commitments. The disengagement process remains 
stalled with no progress made around the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge and an 
increasing number of ceasefire violations recorded in and around the Zolote 
disengagement area. Heavy weapons continue to be seen in violation of 
withdrawal lines, with, for example, the SMM noting 10 multiple launch 
rocket systems near so-called “LPR”-controlled Khrustalnyi on 6 July, and 
self-propelled howitzers near government-controlled Novookhtyrka 
on 8 and 9 July (four and two, respectively).

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> The violence resulted in a number of civilian casualties with two people killed 
and eight injured during the period from 26 June to 9 July, most 
UXO/mine-related and one involving a child. This brings the total number of 
civilian casualties confirmed by the SMM in 2017 to 306, including 56 
fatalities.

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3"> The SMM’s freedom of movement has remained restricted in multiple areas, 
in particular in border areas close to so-called “DPR”-controlled Novoazovsk, 
where armed men have systematically prevented the Mission from patrolling 
for the entire reporting period. Denial of access, in areas not controlled by the 
Government, has sometimes been accompanied by threats to the SMM with, 
for example, an armed so-called “DPR” member pointing a rifle at SMM 
monitors near Kreminets on 7 July.
