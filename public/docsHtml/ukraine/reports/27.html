<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 22 April and 5 May, the SMM confirmed that two civilians were injured. This 
brings the total number of civilian casualties since 1 January 2019 to 33 (five deaths and 
28 injuries). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The SMM recorded almost 12,000 ceasefire violations (over 13,000 in the previous two-
week  period);  and  observed  224  weapons  in  violation  of  the  agreed  withdrawal  lines 
(206 in areas not controlled by the Government). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  Placing  civilians  and  their  property  at  risk,  weapons  remain  in  or  close  to  residential 
areas,  including  in  this  reporting  period,  three  towed  mortars  or  howitzers  in  Para-
skoviivka and multiple launch rocket systems in Luhansk city.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  Although the SMM facilitated and monitored demining activity by the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces at a number of cemeteries, access to and Easter-related activities at cemeteries 
along the contact line were curtailed for many civilians. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The  Mission  continued  to  observe  hardship  faced  by  civilians  at  checkpoints  along  the 
contact line. An additional two deaths from natural causes at checkpoints were record-
ed, bringing the total so far this year to 19.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5"> In addition to the presence of mines and unexploded ordnance, the Missionâ€™s freedom 
of  movement  was  actively  restricted  by  the  armed  formations  43  times  and  by  the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces three times.  SMM mini- and mid-range unmanned aerial vehi-
cles (UAV) continued to experience signal interference, assessed as jamming, while fly-
ing  over  government-  and  non-government-controlled  areas  of  Donetsk  region.  In  one 
case, the Mission lost contact with a mid-range UAV shortly after the aircraft had experi-
enced  signal  interference  near  non-government-controlled  Azov.  Small-arms  fire  was 
twice directed at an SMM mini-UAV sent to locate the lost aircraft.
