<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  11  and  24  February,  the  SMM  recorded  over  15,800  ceasefire  violations 
(compared with almost 10,400 in the previous two-week period) and observed 80 weap-
ons in violation of the withdrawal lines (45 in non-government-controlled areas). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  Two civilians were killed and one was injured when their vehicle hit an explosive device 
(probably  an  anti-tank  mine)  on  the  soft  ground  of  a  median  strip  between  the  road 
lanes  while  crossing  the  contact  line  near  Olenivka.  This  brings  the  number  of  civilian 
casualties in 2019 to two fatalities and seven injuries. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The SMM continued to observe damage caused by shelling and gunfire in and near pop-
ulated areas in both Donetsk and Luhansk regions, including to  residential  buildings in 
government-controlled  Novoluhanske  and  Travneve,  as  well  as  in  non-government-
controlled Donetsk city, Dokuchaievsk, Yasynuvata and Holmivskyi. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  On 18 February, the SMM assessed the damage located about 100m and 300m from its 
residence in non-government-controlled Donetsk city as having been caused by detona-
tions of undetermined explosive devices. No injuries were reported. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The Mission facilitated and monitored localized adherence to the ceasefire on 56 occa-
sions to enable inspections of and repairs to 12 civilian infrastructure facilities along the 
contact  line,  including  power  transmission  lines  near  government-controlled  Zolote-2/
Karbonit and Maiorsk, allowing for the restoration of electricity to about 500 residents; 
to  the  non-government  controlled  Donetskyi  Water  Supply  Line,  which  services  4,700 
residents; and to Petrivske water pumping station near government-controlled Artema, 
which  provides  approximately  150,000  people  with  water  in  mostly  non-government-
controlled areas. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  On 18 February, an SMM long-range unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) crashed while flying 
near non-government-controlled Berdianka, close to the contact line. The next day, near 
non-government-controlled  Krynychanske,  the  SMM  recovered  parts  of  the  UAV.  The 
SMM is making efforts to determine the cause of the crash. In addition, assessed as due 
to  interference,  on  23  February  the  SMM  lost  control  over  a  mini-UAV  near  non-
government-controlled  Sarabash  and  on  24  February  over  another  mini-UAV  on  the 
edge of non-government-controlled Makiivka.
