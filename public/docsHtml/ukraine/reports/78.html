<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  29  June  and  12  July,  the  SMM  recorded  about  5,200  ceasefire  violations,  in-cluding about 1,700 explosions, compared with approximately 8,700 and 4,700, respec-tively, in the previous two weeks.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The Mission continued monitoring the security situation in and around the three disen-gagement areas. While it observed a calm situation inside the disengagement area near Stanytsia  Luhanska,  it  spotted  the  presence  of  people  inside  the  disengagement  areas near  Zolote  and  Petrivske,  as  well  as  recent  extensions  of  positions  of  the  armed  for-mations inside the disengagement area near Petrivske. The  SMM also recorded cease-fire violations inside the latter area.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  On 30 June, two SMM daylight cameras at the Oktiabr mine, close to Vesele, were dam-aged, resulting in the loss of video feed (see Spot Report 35/2020). SMM ground patrols assessed that it was caused by the detonation of an undetermined projectile in the im-mediate proximity of the camera site.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The Mission corroborated reports of one fatality – a woman in her eighties who died of shrapnel wounds in Zaitseve. This brings the total number of civilian casualties since the beginning of 2020 to 55 – eight fatalities and 47 injuries. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMM continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to ena-ble repairs to, as well as construction and maintenance of, critical civilian infrastructure. This included repairs to power lines, which provide access to electricity to about 300,000 civilians on both sides of the contact line in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The  Mission  continued  to  monitor  the  situation  of  civilians  at  entry-exit  checkpoints along the contact line as a result of measures taken amid the COVID-19 outbreak. These measures  contributed  to  hardship  faced  by  civilians,  many  of  whom  were  elderly, attempting to cross the contact line. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  Between 29 June and 12 July, members of the armed formations continued to deny the SMM  passage  at  checkpoints  along  official  crossing  routes  in  Donetsk  and  Luhansk  re-gions (see Spot Report 36/2020 and Spot Report 37/2020). Overall, the Mission’s free-dom  of  movement  was  restricted  27  times  (26  times  in  non-government-controlled areas and once in a government-controlled area). SMM unmanned aerial vehicles were subjected to signal interference on both sides of the contact line on 30 occasions, and were  targeted  by  small-arms  fire  twice  –  once  near  Petrivske  and  once  near  Stanytsia Luhanska.</a></p>
