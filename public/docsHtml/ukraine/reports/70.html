<p><a id="1" name="1"> The  Mission  continued  to  monitor  the  disengagement  areas  near  Stanytsia  Luhanska,  Zolote and Petrivske, again recording ceasefire violations in the disengagement area near Petrivske. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> The  SMM  corroborated  reports of  four  civilian  casualties, including  one injury due to  shelling in  non-government-controlled  Donetskyi,  Luhansk  region.  This  brings  the  total  number  of civilian casualties  that  have  been  confirmed  since the  beginning  of  2021  to 51  (12  fatalities and  39 injuries).  Thirty-five  of  these  casualties  were  due  to  mines,  unexploded  ordnance  and other explosive objects, seven were due to small-arms fire and nine due to shelling. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3"> The  Mission’s  freedom of  movement  was  restricted 41  times, including 37 instances in  non-government-controlled  areas  (see  Spot  Report  19/2021).  SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles (UAVs)  were  assessed  as  targeted  by  small-arms  fire  three  times  in  non-government-controlled  areas.  SMM  UAVs  experienced  signal interference  assessed  as caused  by  probable jamming on 74 occasions, while flying on both sides of the contact line.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4"> The  Mission continued  to observe  civilians while  crossing,  or  attempting to  cross,  the  contact line and their challenges. It again noted that the only crossing points civilians were able to use were  near  Stanytsia  Luhanska  (open  daily)  and  Novotroitske/Olenivka  (open twice  a  week,  as the corresponding  checkpoint  of  the  armed  formations  there is  only open  on  Mondays  and Fridays).  
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5"> The  SMM continued  to  facilitate  and  monitor  adherence  to localized ceasefires to  enable the maintenance  and operation  of  critical  civilian infrastructure, including  repairs  to power  lines near  Olenivka  and  Taramchuk  (benefitting  several  thousand people on  both  sides  of  the  con-tact line). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6"> The  SMM  monitored  areas  in east,  south-east  and  south-west Kherson  region,  where it ob-served no change in the security situation.
