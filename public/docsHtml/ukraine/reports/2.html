<p><a id="0" name="0">  The  SMM  observed  a  marked  decrease  in  violence  after  the  sides  renewed 

their  commitment  to  the  ceasefire  for  the  new  school  year  starting  from             
1  September  and  generally  recorded  double-digit  numbers  of  ceasefire  viola-
tions.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  Risk  factors  remained,  with  weapons  in  violation  of  withdrawal  lines;  mines, 

unexploded  ordnance  and  remnants  of  war  present;  armed  forces  and           
formations precariously positioned close to one another. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The  sides  continued  to  restrict  SMM  freedom  of  movement,  mostly  in  areas 
not  controlled  by  the  Government,  and  placed  other  impediments  in  its  way. 
SMM  auxiliary  camera  equipment,  for  example,  was  stolen  and  destroyed  at 
the “DPR”-controlled Oktiabr mine on 3 September.
