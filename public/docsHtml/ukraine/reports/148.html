<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 8 and 21 April, the SMM confirmed that two civilians were killed and nine were 
injured.  This  brings  the  total  number  of  civilian  casualties  since  1  January  2019  to  31 
(five deaths and 26 injuries). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The SMM recorded over 13,000 ceasefire violations (about 14,700 in the previous two-
week  period);  and  observed  270  weapons  in  violation  of  the  agreed  withdrawal  lines 
(218 in areas not controlled by the Government). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The situation in and close to the Zolote disengagement area remained volatile, with the 
Mission  observing  fresh  impacts  near  residential  buildings  –  with  an  11-year  old  girl 
receiving injuries in one instance – and damage to a functioning school. Pupils and staff 
had to take cover in the school’s shelter on one occasion when shelling occurred as clas-
ses  were  underway.  The  Mission  also  observed  mines,  personnel,  positions  and  hard-
ware inside the disengagement area.   

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  Mission  continued  to  face  restrictions  on  its  freedom  of  movement  and  other  im-
pediments to fulfilment of its Mandate. In addition to mines and unexploded ordnance, 
members  of  the  armed  formations  restricted  the  SMM’s  freedom  of movement  on  46 
occasions and the Ukrainian Armed Forces six times.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  Targeting  of  SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAV)  has  continued.  Small-arms  fire  was 
directed  towards  SMM  UAVs  on  five  occasions.  One  mini-UAV  was  hit  by  a  bullet.  Al-
most  on  a  daily  basis,  SMM  UAVs  were  subjected  to  signal  interference  (assessed  as 
jamming).  A  long-range  UAV  was  lost  on  19  April  close  to  the  contact  line  in  Donetsk 
region. It is the third such aircraft to be lost in six months.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  On 21 April, during the second round of the presidential election, the SMM observed a 
calm  security  situation  in  Kyiv,  Kherson,  Mykolaiv,  Odessa,  Lviv,  Ivano-Frankivsk, 
Zakarpattia,  Kharkiv,  Dnipropetrovsk,  Vinnytsia,  and  Chernivtsi  regions,  as  well  as  in 
government-controlled  areas  of  Donetsk  and  Luhansk  regions,  including  at  entry-exit 
checkpoints.
