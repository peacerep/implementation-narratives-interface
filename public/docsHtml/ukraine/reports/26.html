<p><a id="0" name="0">  There  were  continued  violations  of  the  ceasefire  by  both  sides.  The  OSCE       

Special  Monitoring  Mission  to  Ukraine  (SMM)  recorded  the  most  violent    
breaches  west  of  Donetsk  city  and  around  Donetsk  airport,  in  and  around 
Horlivka – in particular, in the Svitlodarsk/Debaltseve area – and in areas north-
east of Mariupol, around Kominternove. In Luhansk region, the overall security 
situation remained relatively calm, with daily ceasefire violations numbering in 
the low double-digits – most of these were attributable to live-fire exercises.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The SMM noted a slight decrease in the use of artillery and mortars. Worryingly, 
however,  monitors  observed  a  greater  use  of  multiple  launch  rocket  systems 
and noted their presence  within the respective  withdrawal lines as defined by 
the Minsk Package of Measures.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  Mission  noted  an  increased  presence  of  other  proscribed  weapons  inside 
the security zone. The SMM also continued to record weapons as missing from 
permanent storage sites and heavy weapons holding areas. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  SMM  Forward  Patrol  Base  in  Stanytsia  Luhanska  is  temporarily  not           

operational due to security concerns.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  On 3 March the Chief Monitor of the OSCE SMM Ertugrul Apakan welcomed the 

decisions  on  mine  action  and  the  prohibition  of  live-fire  exercises  by  the         
Trilateral  Contact  Group.  See:  www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/225566.  The  SMM 
will  impartially  and  objectively  monitor  and  report  on  the  progress  made  in   
implementing these decisions.
