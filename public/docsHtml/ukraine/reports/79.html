<p><a id="0" name="0"> Despite a decrease in ceasefire violations during the period from 13 to 26 June, 
the security situation in eastern Ukraine remained volatile. The SMM recorded 
about 1,000 ceasefire violations over the weekend of 24/25 June. The violence 
resulted in a high number of civilian casualties, with five people killed and six 
injured during the reporting period. This brings the total number of civilian 
casualties confirmed by the SMM in 2017 to 285, including 52 fatalities.

<p><a id="1" name="1"> The safety and security of SMM monitors was interfered with on two 
occasions. On 20 June, as monitors were patrolling close to the so-called 
“DPR”-controlled Yasynuvata railway station, an armed man pointed an 
assault rifle at them, then tried to smash the windows of their vehicle and 
subsequently fired shots at the vehicle as it departed from the scene (see: 
www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/324391). On 23 June, in 
government-controlled Zolote, bullets, mortars and grenades were fired 
approximately 100m from SMM patrol members, with some bullets 
flying close overhead (see: www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-toukraine/325376).

<p><a id="2" name="2"> The SMM continued to note long queues of civilians waiting long hours to 
travel in both directions on the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge. On 21 June, SMM 
monitors observed additional damage to the bridge, with people falling as a 
result.

<p><a id="3" name="3"> The SMM observed water shortages in several settlements affected by damage 
to a water pumping station near Vasylivka, as well as shortage of gas supply in 
Avdiivka and Pikuzy. On 23 June, an SMM unmanned aerial vehicle located an 
extensive leakage on the South Donbas water pipeline, putting at risk water 
supply for 1.5 million people on both sides of the contact line.

<p><a id="4" name="4"> On 24 June, the SMM opened a new forward patrol base in Popasna, Luhansk 
region, allowing for sustained monitoring in the area.
