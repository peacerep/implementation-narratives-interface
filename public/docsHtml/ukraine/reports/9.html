<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  27  July  and  9  August,  the  SMM  recorded  256  ceasefire  violations,  including 
45 explosions, compared with 8,094 and 2,078, respectively, in the previous two weeks. Most 
violations were observed on 27 and 31 July – 111 and 101, respectively – followed by a calm 
security situation, with a number of days in which no ceasefire violations were recorded. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  On 27 July, the sides – as agreed at a meeting of the Trilateral Contact Group five days earlier 

– began the observance of the ceasefire based on a set of additional measures.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  Mission  corroborated  reports  of  one  civilian  casualty,  an  injury  sustained  on  27  July, 

bringing the total number since the beginning of 2020 to 61 – eight fatalities and 53 injuries. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  SMM continued  monitoring the  security  situation in  and  around  the  three pilot  disen-
gagement areas, noting in particular the presence of people within or close to former military 
and military-type positions inside the ones near Zolote and Petrivske. It recorded no ceasefire 
violations inside any of the disengagement areas. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The  SMM  continued  to  facilitate  and  monitor  adherence  to  localized  ceasefires  to  enable 
construction  and  maintenance  of  critical  civilian  infrastructure.  Notably,  the  Mission contin-
ued to facilitate the operation of the Donetsk Filtration Station, which provides potable water 
to about 380,000 civilians on both sides of the contact line in Donetsk region. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the SMM continued to note limited numbers of civilians cross-
ing the contact line at Stanytsia Luhanska bridge, with many denied entry because of residen-
cy requirements,  the operation of  a list  system or  difficulties in  downloading  a  self-isolation 
tracking application. In Donetsk region, where entry-exit checkpoints are mostly open, corre-
sponding checkpoints of the armed formations – except one, which operated only two days a 
week – remained closed, resulting in severely restricted movement and hardship for the civil-
ian population.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The  Mission’s  freedom  of movement  was  restricted  17  times  on  the  ground,  all but  one  in 
non-government-controlled  areas.  SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  experienced  signal  inter-
ference  assessed  as caused  by probable jamming  on 25 occasions while  flying near the  con-
tact line in  government-  and  non-government-controlled  areas,  including  twice over  the dis-
engagement area near Petrivske. Combined with the destruction by gunfire of the SMM cam-
era system in Petrivske on 2 June and the presence of mines along the Bohdanivka-Viktorivka
-Petrivske  road,  the  Mission’s  ability  to  effectively  monitor  in  this  disengagement  area  re-
mains severely limited.
