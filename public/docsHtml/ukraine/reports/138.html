<p><a id="0" name="0">  For  the  fourteenth  week,  the  security  situation  remains  relatively  calm  following  addi-tional  measures  to  strengthen  the  ceasefire,  which  took  effect  on  27  July.  Between  19 October  and  1  November,  the  SMM  recorded  253  ceasefire  violations,  compared  with 215 in the previous two-week period.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  Mission  continued  monitoring  the  security  situation  in  and  around  the  three  pilot disengagement areas, recording no ceasefire violations inside any of them, but noting the regular presence of people within, or close to, former military and military-type positions inside the areas near Petrivske and Zolote.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  During the past weeks, SMM unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) spotted new trenches and extensions  to  existing  trenches  in  areas  between  government-controlled  Vodiane  and non-government-controlled Uzhivka. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The SMM corroborated reports of five civilian casualties, including two fatalities. Four of the casualties were due to the detonation of explosive devices and one, occurring on 20 March in Donetsk city, due to shelling. This brings the total number of civilian casualties since the beginning of 2020 to 92: 16 fatalities and 76 injuries.

<p><a id="4" name="4"> The Mission continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to ena-ble repairs to and maintenance of critical civilian infrastructure on both sides of the con-tact line. This included repairs to water infrastructure near Pankivka and Krasnyi Lyman providing water to around 250,000 civilians, and inspection of power lines near Zolote-4/Rodina, providing electricity to several thousand civilians.  In  Luhansk  region,  the  Mission  noted  that  the  entry-exit  checkpoint  (EECP)  in  Stanytsia Luhanska  has  remained  closed  since  15  October  due  to  COVID-19  mitigation  measures while  the  corresponding  checkpoint  of  the  armed  formations  remained  partially  opera-tional. In Donetsk region, where EECPs remain operational, the only corresponding oper-ational checkpoint of the armed formations is the one near Olenivka. It is open only two days a week, resulting in severely restricted movement and hardship for the civilian pop-ulation.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The Mission’s freedom of movement was restricted seven times on the ground, all in non-government-controlled  areas.  SMM  UAVs  experienced  signal  interference  assessed  as caused  by  probable  jamming  on  22  occasions  while  flying  on  both  sides  of  the  contact line, including twice over the disengagement area near  Petrivske  and once close to the disengagement area near Stanytsia Luhanska. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  Crossing difficulties at the contact line continue to hinder the SMM’s monitoring of non-government-controlled areas. </a></p>
