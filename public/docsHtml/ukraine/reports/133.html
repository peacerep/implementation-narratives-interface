<p><a id="0" name="0"> In the past two weeks, the SMM recorded an increase in the number of ceasefire viola-
tions  in  eastern  Ukraine  as  compared  to  the  relatively  low  levels  of  violence  observed 
over and immediately after Orthodox Easter. Between 6 and 19 May, monitors recorded 
around 7,000 ceasefire violations per week (around 4,000 had been recorded the week 
before).

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The second week of May saw a  significant increase in the use of weapons that should 
have been withdrawn in accordance with the Minsk agreements (around 1,000 instanc-
es).  In  total,  from  6  to  19  May  monitors  observed  277  weapons  in  violation  of  the 
agreed withdrawal lines (216 in areas not controlled by the Government). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  Shelling and small-arms fire continued to impact civilian infrastructure. In particular, the 
SMM  observed  fresh  gunfire  damage  to  two  functioning  schools  in  Troitske  and  in 
Zolote-5/Mykhailivka. In Troitske, monitors were told that students had been at school 
when the damage occurred. The school in Zolote has been hit nine times since Decem-
ber 2018. The area around the Donetsk Filtration Station, which supplies potable water 
to  nearly  380,000  people  on  both  sides  of  the  contact  line,  continued  to  experience 
shelling. In one instance on 15 May, the SMM, while facilitating and monitoring adher-
ence to the ceasefire to enable the operation of the facility, heard three outgoing explo-
sions less than 300 metres from their position.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  Mission  confirmed  two  civilian  casualties,  bringing  the  total  number  registered  by 
the SMM in 2019 to 35 (six deaths and 29 injuries). In one instance, a man died after a 
metal object he had found in the outskirts of Velyka Novosilka exploded.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMM continued to observe people applying for passports of the Russian Federation 
in non-government-controlled areas of Donetsk region and started to observe the same 
in Luhansk region. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The SMM continued to enable repairs to critical civilian infrastructure on both sides of 
the contact line. In particular, repairs to power lines between Zolote-5/Mykhailivka and 
Yuzhna-Lomuvatka, and to almost 150 damaged houses in Marinka and Krasnohorivka.
