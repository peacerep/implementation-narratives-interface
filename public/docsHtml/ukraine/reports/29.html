<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 5 and 18 April 2021, the SMM recorded 3,828 ceasefire violations, compared 
with 3,922 in the previous two-week period. Of note, a spike of 1,745 ceasefire viola-
tions  (more  than  1,500  of  them  assessed  as  live-fire  exercises  in  non-government-
controlled areas of Donetsk region) was recorded on 15 April. This is the highest number 
of  ceasefire  violations  on  a  single  day  since  the  entry  into  force  of  the  measures  to 
strengthen the ceasefire on 27 July 2020.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  SMM  continued  to  monitor  the  disengagement  areas  near  Stanytsia  Luhanska, 
Zolote and Petrivske, recording no ceasefire violations inside any of the areas, but ob-
serving people in the latter two.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  Mission  continued  to  facilitate  and  monitor  adherence  to  localized  ceasefires  to 
enable  repairs  to  and  maintenance  and  operation  of  critical  civilian  infrastructure  on 
both  sides  of  the  contact  line,  including  maintenance  and  repairs  to  power  lines  in 
Zaitseve and near Zolote-5/Mykhailivka (altogether benefitting over 33,000 civilians). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The SMM continued to observe civilians while crossing, or attempting to cross, the con-
tact line and their challenges. It again noted that the only crossing points civilians were 
able  to  use  were  near  Stanytsia  Luhanska  (opened  daily)  and  Novotroitske/Olenivka 
(twice a week, as the armed formations’ checkpoint there is only open on Mondays and 
Fridays).  

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The Mission’s freedom of movement on the ground was restricted 20 times, all in non-
government-controlled areas, including twice when members of the armed formations 
again  conditioned  passage  through  their  checkpoints  on  the  contact  line  on  visual  in-
spection of SMM vehicles (see Spot Reports 7/2021 and 9/2021). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  SMM unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) were targeted 13 times by small-arms fire, all but 
three in non-government-controlled areas. The Mission’s UAVs experienced signal inter-
ference assessed as caused by probable jamming or jamming on 136 occasions on both 
sides of the contact line, including 12 cases when long-range UAVs were targeted, caus-
ing four flight cancellations, one inability to take off and one emergency landing of long-
range UAVs (see Spot Reports 6/2021 and 8/2021). One mini-UAV was also lost due to 
jamming.  Over  the last two  months,  82  per  cent  of  SMM  long-range  UAV flights  have 
encountered GPS signal interference. The Mission had to disable its camera system at 
the Oktiabr mine near Donetsk city on 19 April to avoid interference with its monitoring, 
after two men in camouflage-clothing had mounted two cameras on the SMM’s camera 
mast and the tower on which the mast is emplaced (see Spot Report 10/2021).
