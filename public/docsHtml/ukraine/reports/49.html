<p><a id="12" name="12"> The  SMM  continued  to  facilitate  the  daily  access  of  Voda  Donbassa  employees  to  and  from 
the  Donetsk  Filtration  Station  to  keep  the  station  operational  and  to  monitor  the  security 
situation.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">Despite explicit security guarantees in place, the SMM recorded ceasefire violations 
during  the  two-week  reporting  period,  which  posed  a  threat  to  the  employees  and  to  the 
SMM.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">On 3 May the Chief Monitor Ertugrul Apakan in his statement emphasised that ongoing 
failure to implement the Minsk agreements jeopardizes Donetsk Filtration Station’s work, puts 
at risk civilians on both sides of the contact line and the SMM monitoring officers facilitating 
their access.</a></p>
