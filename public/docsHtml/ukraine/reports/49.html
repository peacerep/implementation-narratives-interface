<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  30  April  and  13  May,  the  security  situation  along  the  contact  line  in  the  east  of 
Ukraine remained volatile. The OSCE SMM recorded almost 10,900 ceasefire violations – a 20 
per  cent  increase  since  the  previous  two-week  reporting  period.  In  one  day,  on  3  May,  the 
Mission recorded more than 2,000 ceasefire  violations  – the highest  number recorded  since 
March.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The Mission continued to observe  weapons in  violation of withdrawal lines on both sides of 
the  contact  line.  Many  weapons  in  violation  were  seen  at  military-style  parades  in  Donetsk 
and Luhansk cities on 9 May, including nine MLRS (BM-21, Grad), nine self-propelled howitzers 
(2S1) and 18 towed howitzers (nine D-30 and nine 2A65). In another instance, on 8 May, the 
SMM  saw  a  surface-to-air  missile  system  (9K35)  parked  between  two  civilian  houses  in 
Pobeda, a government-controlled area.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  From 30 April to 13 May, the SMM corroborated 1 civilian death and 4 civilian injuries. This 
brings the total number of civilian casualties confirmed by the SMM since the beginning of the 
year to 79 casualties, including 19 fatalities.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  SMM  continued  to  facilitate  the  daily  access  of  Voda  Donbassa  employees  to  and  from 
the  Donetsk  Filtration  Station  to  keep  the  station  operational  and  to  monitor  the  security 
situation. Despite explicit security guarantees in place, the SMM recorded ceasefire violations 
during  the  two-week  reporting  period,  which  posed  a  threat  to  the  employees  and  to  the 
SMM. On 3 May the Chief Monitor Ertugrul Apakan in his statement emphasised that ongoing 
failure to implement the Minsk agreements jeopardizes Donetsk Filtration Station’s work, puts 
at risk civilians on both sides of the contact line and the SMM monitoring officers facilitating 
their access. http://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/379429
