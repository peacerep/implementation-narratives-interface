<p><a id="0" name="0">  Over the last two weeks, the SMM registered a decrease in the number of ceasefire viola-tions  and  considerably  fewer  cases  of  the  use  of  weapons  that  should  have  been  with-drawn  in  accordance  with  the  Minsk  agreements.  Between  7  and  13  August,  the  SMM recorded about 15 % fewer ceasefire violations compared with the previous week. From 14 to 20 August, the number of ceasefire violations decreased by some 45 % compared with the week before.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  Violence resulted in a number of civilian casualties with two people killed and seven in-jured from 7 to 20 August. This brought the total number of civilian casualties confirmed by the SMM in 2017 to 357, including 66 fatalities.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  SMM’s  freedom  of  movement  continued  to  be  restricted  due  to  the  presence  of mines  and  unexploded  ordnance,  in  particular  at  Shchastia  Bridge  and  on  the  road  be-tween Pikuzy and Mariupol. The Joint Centre for Control and Co-ordination has, however, on  some  occasions  successfully  co-ordinated  between  the  sides  to  ensure  de-mining, notably along the Svitlodarsk-Debaltseve road.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  Continued attacks on technical monitoring equipment, namely unmanned aerial vehicles and cameras, also impacted the Mission’s ability to monitor. On 10 August, the Mission’s newly  installed  thermal  camera  at  the  Donetsk  Filtration  Station  near  Yasynuvata  was destroyed  by  small-arms  fire.  The  SMM  Chief  Monitor  condemned  the  incident  (see: www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/335046).

<p><a id="4" name="4">  Threats and intimidation – used also to undermine the Mission’s work – continued: on 13 August  an  armed  man  at  Stanytsia  Luhanska  bridge  threatened  to  shoot  SMM  patrol members (see www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/335566). Report: Spot
