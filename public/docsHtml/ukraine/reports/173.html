structure, upon which  over 100,000 people depend, near Pankivka, Holmivskyi, 
Krasnyi Lyman, Zolote-5/Mykhailivka, Kamianka and Dolomitne.

checkpoints  along  official  crossing  routes  in  Donetsk  and  Luhansk  regions  (see 
Spot  Report  17/2020, Spot  Report  18/2020, Spot  Report  19/2020 and  Spot  Re-
