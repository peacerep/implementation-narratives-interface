<p><a id="1" name="1"> The  Mission  also  registered  limited  compliance  with  the  Trilateral  Contact  Groupâ€™s  Framework       Decision on Disengagement of Forces and Hardware. As indicated by ceasefire violations, the lack of compliance  was  observed  in  all  three  disengagement  areas,  new  positions  and  reinforced  existing positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the armed formations in the Zolote disengagement area as well as new extensions of positions in the Petrivske disengagement area. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> About  three  quarters  of  all  ceasefire  violations  were  recorded  in  the  Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-Donetsk airport  area  and  areas  east  and  north-east  of  Mariupol  and  south  and  south-east  of  Svitlodarsk.  In addition to these three main hotspots, the Mission continued to note a tense and kinetic situation in and  around  Zolote  and  in  the  disengagement  area  immediately  to  its  south.  During  shelling  on 8  November,  a  man  in  his  sixties  was  killed  and  on  two  occasions,  SMM  monitoring  officers  were forced to withdraw following impacts within 500 metres of their positions.
