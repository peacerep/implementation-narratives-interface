Less than two hours later, the same patrol, while stationary in Adviivka, came under cross fire including by 152mm artillery that is proscribed under the Minsk agreements. In both cases there were no injuries.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  On 2 May the Chief Monitor of the SMM, Ambassador Ertugrul Apakan, expressed his deep concern about an increase in incidents, involving live fire near and at SMM patrols. Apakan reiterated his call for all sides to exercise maximum restraint and to do their utmost to ensure the safety and security of the SMM monitors. Patrolling in high risk areas has been reduced for the time being.
