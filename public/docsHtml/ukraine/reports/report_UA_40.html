<p><a id="2" name="2">Between  5  and  18  February,  the  security  situation  in  eastern  Ukraine  remained  volatile. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">Periods  of  relative  calm  were  interrupted  by  sudden  violent  flare-ups,  in  particular  in  the 
Svitlodarsk-Debaltseve area, in the west of Luhansk region and in areas east and north-east of 
Mariupol.</a></p>

<p><a id="7" name="7">On one particular day, 7 February, the Mission recorded 360 instances of the use of multiple

<p><a id="11" name="11"> </a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">Much  of  the  violence  occurred  in  rural  areas,  resulting  in  four  injuries.  </a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">There  were  three 
children  among  them,  who  were  injured  in  an  incident  involving  unexploded  ordnance  in 
Krasnohorivka  on  6  February.  </a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">The  failure  of  the  sides  to  remove  mines  and  other  explosive 
remnants  of  war  remains  a  constant  feature.  </a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">It  is  an  ever-present  threat  to  civilians, 
particularly children, as well as to SMM monitors.

<p><a id="16" name="16">In  addition  to  the  risk  posed  by  mines  and  unexploded  ordnance,  the  Mission  –  both  its 
monitoring  officers  and  its  equipment  –  was  targeted  or  endangered  a  number  of  times  by 
small-arms  fire.  </a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">Armed  “DPR”  members  fired  shots  close  to  SMM  monitors,  and  SMM 
unmanned aerial vehicles were fired upon four times, twice on each side of the contact line.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">In  addition  to  the  presence  of  mines,  the  Mission’s  freedom  of  movement  was  directly 
restricted  by  the  sides:</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20"> </a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">twice  in  areas  controlled  by  the  government  and  37  times  in  areas 
outside government control.</a></p>

<p><a id="25" name="25">Between 5 and 18 February, the Mission facilitated and monitored 34 “windows of silence”  – 
localized adherence to the ceasefire – which allowed for repairs and maintenance work on 12 
critical civilian infrastructure  facilities on both sides of the contact line.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">In two cases  – at the 
water  wells  near  non-government-controlled  Krasnyi  Lyman  and  at  the  Petrivske  pumping 
station near government-controlled Artema – a quarter of a million people benefited from the 
repairs.</a></p>

vandalism against a number of buildings in Kyiv associated with the Russian Federation.
