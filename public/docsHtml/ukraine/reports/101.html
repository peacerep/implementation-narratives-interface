<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  18  and  31  October,  the  SMM  recorded  an  increase  in  the  number  of  ceasefire violations – 5,523 compared with 4,193 in the previous two-week period.

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1"> In  a  joint  statement  on  20  October,  OSCE  Chairperson-in-Office  and  the  OSCE  Secretary 
General called for removal of impediments on the SMM’s freedom of movement in non-
government-controlled areas of Ukraine, and urged de-escalation.   

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  Despite the Mission’s attempts to address impediments to its freedom of movement, the 
SMM  remained  unable  to  fully  conduct  its  monitoring  activities  across  the  contact  line, 
thus  forcing  the  Mission  to  continue  acting  as  separate  operational  entities.  These  re-
strictions and measures continue to directly limit the SMM’s ability to implement its man-
date. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  Overall during the two-week period, the Mission’s freedom of  movement was restricted 
35 times, including 31 instances in non-government-controlled areas. In particular, on 27 
October, at Stanytsia Luhanska bridge, members of the armed formations delayed by 98 
minutes SMM’s exit out of non-government controlled areas (see Spot Report  23/2021). 
SMM unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were assessed as targeted by small-arms fire one 
time in non-government-controlled areas. Mission UAVs experienced signal interference, 
assessed as caused by probable jamming on 121 occasions, including 42 instances experi-
enced by long-range UAVs, while flying on both sides of the contact line.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The  Mission  continued  to  monitor  the  disengagement  areas  near  Stanytsia  Luhanska, 
Zolote and Petrivske. It again recorded ceasefire violations inside and close to the disen-
gagement areas near Zolote and Petrivske as well as close to the disengagement area near 
Stanytsia Luhanska. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The  SMM  corroborated  reports  of  three  civilian  casualties,  all  injuries  –  two  due  to  the 
impact of shelling and one due to a gunshot wound. This brings the total number of con-
firmed civilian casualties since the beginning of 2021 to 81 (15 fatalities and 66 injured).  

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The  Mission  followed  up  on  reports  of  damage  to  21  civilian  properties  and  a  working 
kindergarten, on both sides of the contact line, including in Hranitne and in Donetsk city’s 
Kuibyshevskyi  district,  Donetsk  region  as  well  as  in  Zolote-5/Mykhailivka  in  Luhansk  re-
gion. Overall since the beginning of 2021, the SMM has confirmed damage to 142 civilian 
properties and infrastructure objects. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">  The SMM continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to enable 
repairs  and  operation  of  critical  civilian  infrastructure  on  both  sides  of  the  contact  line, 
including repairs to power lines in Staromykhailivka, as well as to enable the construction 
of a road near Vodiane.
