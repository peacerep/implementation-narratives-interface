<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 1 and 14 July, the SMM confirmed that 3 civilians were killed and 13 were in-
jured. This brings the total number of civilian casualties since 1 January 2019 to 81 (10 
deaths and 71 injuries).  

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The SMM observed  damage caused by  small-arms fire and shelling to civilian  property 
and infrastructure in numerous locations along the contact line, including to a day clinic, 
a power station, residential homes and functioning schools. One school in Zolote, which 
was hit by gunfire, has sustained damage 11 times since the start of the year. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The SMM recorded over 14,000 ceasefire violations (compared with about 14,350 in the 
previous two-week period). In the Zolote disengagement area, where the Mission noted 
the continued presence of forces and hardware, the number of ceasefire violations re-
mained  high.  No  ceasefire  violations  were  recorded  in  the  Stanytsia  Luhanska  disen-
gagement area since the Mission noted the disengagement of forces and hardware from 
the area on 26 June. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The Mission observed 119 weapons in violation of the agreed withdrawal lines (109 in 
areas not controlled by the Government); and mines and unexploded ordnance, includ-
ing over 1,000 freshly-laid anti-tank mines near Veselohorivka. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  On two occasions, small-arms fire occurred close to the SMM near the Zolote disengage-ment area; on both occasions, bullets flew over the heads of SMM patrol members. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5"> In  addition  to  restrictions  posed  by  mines,  UXO  and  crossfire,  the  SMMâ€™s  freedom  of 
movement was restricted 4 times in government-controlled areas and 39 times in non-
government-controlled areas. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAV)  were  targeted  by  small-arms  fire  on  four  occa-
sions,  and  subjected  to  signal  interference,  assessed  as  jamming,  on  an  almost  daily 
basis. Twenty two of 25 mini-UAV flights conducted to search for a long-range UAV lost 
on  27  June  near  Zaichenko  experienced  GPS  signal  interference.  One  SMM  mini-UAV 
was lost while flying over Khreshchatytske. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">  On  17  July,  the  Trilateral  Contact  Group,  with  the  participation  of  representatives  of 
certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, re-affirmed its full commitment to a com-
prehensive, sustainable and unlimited ceasefire to start at 00:01 on 21 July.
