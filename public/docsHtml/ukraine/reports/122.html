<p><a id="0" name="0">  For the tenth week in a row, the security situation remains relatively calm following addi-
tional  measures  to  strengthen  the  ceasefire,  which  took  effect  on  27  July.  Between  21 
September  and  4  October,  the  SMM  recorded  429  ceasefire  violations,  compared  with 
120 in the previous two-week period. At 71 days, the Mission marked the longest period 
after  a  recommitment  to  the  ceasefire  where  ceasefire  violations  did  not  reach  pre-
recommitment levels.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The SMM continued monitoring the security situation in and around the three pilot dis-
engagement  areas,  recording  no  ceasefire  violations,  but  noting  again  the  regular  pres-
ence of people within, or close to, former military and military-type positions inside the 
areas  near  Zolote  and  Petrivske.  The  Mission’s  ability  to  access  and  monitor  the  latter 
area remains hindered due to the destruction of the SMM camera system in Petrivske by 
gunfire  on  2  June,  as  well  as  a  lack  of  demining  to  provide  access  to  the  Bohdanivka-
Viktorivka-Petrivske road.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  The Mission corroborated reports of nine civilian casualties  – including three fatalities – 
resulting from the detonation of explosive devices, two of which took place prior to the 
additional measures coming in to effect on 27 July. This brings the total number of civilian 
casualties since the beginning of 2020 to 79: 13 fatalities and 66 injuries. For the tenth 
consecutive week, the Mission received no reports of civilian casualties due to shelling or 
small-arms fire.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The SMM continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to enable 
repairs to and maintenance of critical civilian infrastructure. This included repairs to pow-
er lines near Zolote-4/Rodina, Dovhe, Zhovte, Kruta Hora, Raivka and Vesela Hora, bene-
fitting several thousand residents on both sides of the contact line. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the SMM continued to note reduced numbers of civilians 
crossing  the  contact  line  at  Stanytsia  Luhanska  bridge  and  observed  that  some  civilians 
continued  to  stay  overnight  near  the  entry-exit  checkpoint  (EECP).  On  1  October,  the 
Mission noted that the EECP was closed due to a wildfire. It reopened on 5 October. 
In Donetsk region, where EECPs remain operational, the only corresponding checkpoint 
of the armed formations that is operational is the one near Olenivka and it is open only 
two days a week, resulting in severely restricted movement and hardship for the civilian 
population.  In  some  cases,  people  had  to  stay  overnight,  some  spending  their  nights 
without shelter or adequate facilities, as they waited for permission to cross. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The Mission’s freedom of movement was restricted 16 times on the ground, all in non-
government-controlled  areas.  SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  were  twice  targeted  by 
small-arms fire and experienced signal interference assessed as caused by probable jam-
ming on 15 occasions while flying on both sides of the contact line, including twice over 
the disengagement area near Petrivske. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  Crossing difficulties at the contact line continue to hinder the SMM’s monitoring of non-

government-controlled areas.
