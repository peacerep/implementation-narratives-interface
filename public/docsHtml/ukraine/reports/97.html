<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  28  June  and  11  July  2021,  the  SMM  noted  a  decrease  in  the  number  of ceasefire violations – 3,975, compared with 4,726 recorded in the previous two-week period.  In an address to the OSCE Permanent Council, Ambassador Y. Halit Çevik, Chief Moni-tor of the SMM, stressed that the security situation in eastern Ukraine is not improv-ing and challenges are becoming acute, calling on the sides to return to a construc-tive approach.

<p><a id="1" name="1"> The Mission continued to monitor the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote and Petrivske, again recording ceasefire violations inside the latter area. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  Over the past two weeks, the SMM corroborated reports of seven civilian casualties, including a civilian who died due to an explosion in Donetsk city. This brings the total number of civilian casualties that have been confirmed since the beginning of 2021 to 46 (12 fatalities and 34 injuries).  
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  Mission’s  freedom  of  movement  was  restricted  36  times,  34  of  which  were  in non-government-controlled  areas.  SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAVs)  were  as-sessed  as  targeted  by  small-arms  fire  twice  –  once  in  government-controlled  and once  in  non-government-controlled  areas.  The  Mission’s  UAVs  experienced  signal interference assessed as caused by probable jamming or jamming on 114 occasions on both sides of the contact line, including one instance when a long-range UAV was lost  due  to  dual  GPS  signal  interference  assessed  as  jamming  (see  Spot  Report 16/2021). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMM camera at the Oktiabr mine near non-government-controlled Donetsk city was damaged due to small-arms fire (see Spot Report 17/2021). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  During the reporting period, the SMM continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to  localized  ceasefires  to  enable  the  maintenance  and  operation  of  critical  civilian infrastructure on both sides of the contact line, including the maintenance of power lines near Olenivka (providing electricity to a couple thousand civilians) and repairs to a water pipeline near Berezove (providing water to about 8,000 civilians). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The Mission continued to observe civilians while crossing, or attempting to cross, the contact line and their challenges. It again noted that the only crossing points civilians were  able  to  use  were  near  Stanytsia  Luhanska  (open  daily)  and  Novotroitske/Olenivka  (open  twice  a  week,  as  the  corresponding  checkpoint  of  the  armed  for-mations there is only open on Mondays and Fridays). </a></p>
