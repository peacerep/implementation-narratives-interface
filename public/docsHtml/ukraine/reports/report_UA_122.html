<p><a id="0" name="0">FACTS MATTER 
  For the tenth week in a row, the security situation remains relatively calm following addi-
tional  measures  to  strengthen  the  ceasefire,  which  took  effect  on  27  July.  </a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">Between  21 
September  and  4  October,  the  SMM  recorded  429  ceasefire  violations,  compared  with 
120 in the previous two-week period.</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">At 71 days, the Mission marked the longest period 
after  a  recommitment  to  the  ceasefire  where  ceasefire  violations  did  not  reach  pre-
recommitment levels.</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMM continued monitoring the security situation in and around the three pilot dis-
engagement  areas,  recording  no  ceasefire  violations,  but  noting  again  the  regular  pres-
ence of people within, or close to, former military and military-type positions inside the 
areas  near  Zolote  and  Petrivske.  </a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">The  Mission’s  ability  to  access  and  monitor  the  latter 
area remains hindered due to the destruction of the SMM camera system in Petrivske by 
gunfire  on  2  June,  as  well  as  a  lack  of  demining  to  provide  access  to  the  Bohdanivka-
Viktorivka-Petrivske road.</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">  The Mission corroborated reports of nine civilian casualties  – including three fatalities – 
resulting from the detonation of explosive devices, two of which took place prior to the 
additional measures coming in to effect on 27 July.</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">This brings the total number of civilian 
casualties since the beginning of 2020 to 79:</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">13 fatalities and 66 injuries.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">For the tenth 
consecutive week, the Mission received no reports of civilian casualties due to shelling or 
small-arms fire.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">

</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">  The SMM continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to enable 
repairs to and maintenance of critical civilian infrastructure.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">This included repairs to pow-
er lines near Zolote-4/Rodina, Dovhe, Zhovte, Kruta Hora, Raivka and Vesela Hora, bene-
fitting several thousand residents on both sides of the contact line.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">

</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">  </a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the SMM continued to note reduced numbers of civilians 
crossing  the  contact  line  at  Stanytsia  Luhanska  bridge  and  observed  that  some  civilians 
continued  to  stay  overnight  near  the  entry-exit  checkpoint  (EECP).  </a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">On  1  October,  the 
Mission noted that the EECP was closed due to a wildfire.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">It reopened on 5 October. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">In Donetsk region, where EECPs remain operational, the only corresponding checkpoint 
of the armed formations that is operational is the one near Olenivka and it is open only 
two days a week, resulting in severely restricted movement and hardship for the civilian 
population.  </a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">In  some  cases,  people  had  to  stay  overnight,  some  spending  their  nights 
without shelter or adequate facilities, as they waited for permission to cross. 

  </a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">The Mission’s freedom of movement was restricted 16 times on the ground, all in non-
government-controlled  areas.  </a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  were  twice  targeted  by 
small-arms fire and experienced signal interference assessed as caused by probable jam-
ming on 15 occasions while flying on both sides of the contact line, including twice over 
the disengagement area near Petrivske.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">

</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">  Crossing difficulties at the contact line continue to hinder the SMM’s monitoring of non-

government-controlled areas.
