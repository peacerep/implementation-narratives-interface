<p><a id="1" name="1">The security situation in eastern Ukraine during the last two weeks remained tense 
with the SMM recording 11,425 ceasefire violations in total along the contact line. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">The  Mission  noted  escalation  in  a  number  of  areas,  notably  in  the  Avdiivka-
Yasynuvata-Donetsk  airport  area  from  30  October  to  5  November  and  in  areas 
east and north-east of Mariupol from 6 to 12 November.</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4"> Factors contributing to such violence – namely the sides’ refusal to fully cease fire, 
withdraw heavy weapons, disengage forces and formations, and de-mine  – were 
evident  throughout  the  reporting  period.  </a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">The  Mission  observed  310  heavy     
weapons that should have been withdrawn according to the Minsk agreements;</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">an   
increased number of ceasefire violations within the Petrivske disengagement area 
towards the end of the reporting period;</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">and mines and unexploded ordnance in 
many areas, including in and around entry-exit checkpoints used by civilians.

<p><a id="9" name="9">The  plight  of  the  civilian  population  in  eastern  Ukraine  has  been  exacerbated  as 
winter  sets  in,  with  many  areas  without  electricity,  water  and  gas  supply.  </a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">The   
Mission  over  the  reporting  period  monitored  and  facilitated  42  “windows  of     
silence” allowing for inspection, repair and maintenance work to 12 infrastructure 
facilities on both sides of the contact line.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">For example, on 10 November the SMM 
continued  to  facilitate  and  monitor  repairs  and  maintenance  work,  co-ordinated 
by  the  Joint  Centre  for  Control  and  Co-ordination  (JCCC),  to  the  power  plant  in 
Shchastia,  high-voltage  lines  between  Troitske  and  Novozvanivka,  power  lines  
between Dovhe and Slovianoserbsk, water wells near Stanytsia Luhanska, and the 
phenol sludge reservoir near Zalizne (formerly Artemove).</a></p>
