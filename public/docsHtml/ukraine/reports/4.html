<p><a id="0" name="0"> In  keeping  with  the  regular  pattern  of  ebbs  and  flows  of  violence,  the  OSCE 
Special  Monitoring  Mission  to  Ukraine  (SMM)  observed  a  generally  high     
number  of  ceasefire  violations  –  mostly  around  Donetsk  airport,  the         
Yasynuvata-Avdiivka area, and on the Svitlodarsk-Debaltseve road. There have 
been  occasional  lulls  and  a  notable  decrease  in  the  violence  observed   
throughout Donbas from 18 to 21 June.   

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The SMM did, however, note a number of breaches of the ceasefire in areas 
that had been otherwise relatively calm, such as western Luhansk region and 
the western outskirts of Horlivka, Berezove and Volnovakha in Donetsk region. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> The SMM is closely monitoring a tense situation at Stanytsia Luhanska bridge, 
where  armed  “LPR”  members  moved  their  positions  forward  across  the       
contact line on 12 June, and the Ukrainian Armed Forces moved theirs forward 
three days later.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  SMM  observed  numerous  weapons  missing  from  storage  sites  and  the 

presence of weapons in violation of withdrawal lines. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  Freedom  of  movement  of  SMM  monitors  continued  to  be  restricted,            

particularly in areas not controlled by the government.
