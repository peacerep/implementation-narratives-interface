<p><a id="0" name="0"> The SMM recorded an approximate 20 per cent decrease in violence between 27 
March and 2 April compared with the previous week, and a calmer situation since the 
renewed commitment to adhere to the ceasefire beginning on 1 April. At the same 
time, the security situation remained volatile and unpredictable.

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1"> From 27 March to 2 April, the Mission observed an almost 90 per cent decrease in the 
use of heavy weapons. But in the preceding week, from 20 to 26 March, the SMM 
recorded the second highest use of proscribed weapons since the Addendum to 
Package of Measures came into force, including at least 3,930 explosions.

<p><a id="2" name="2"> The SMM followed up on the electricity outage at the Donetsk Water Filtration Station (DFS) and in Avdiivka on 30 March (see: www.osce.org/special-monitoringmission-to-ukraine/309051). It facilitated and monitored de-mining activities and 
repairs at the damaged power lines in the area of the DFS, which were completed on 
4 April.

<p><a id="3" name="3"> From 23 March to 5 April, the Mission faced three serious incidents involving smallarms fire. Two cases occurred in the “DPR”-controlled areas: on 28 March and 2 April 
in Kozatske and Sakhanka, respectively, where armed men opened fire close to the 
SMM patrols (see: www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/308426; 
www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/309116).

UAV (see: www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/307681). No SMM 
personnel were injured and no assets damaged.
