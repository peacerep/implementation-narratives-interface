<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  11  and  22  December  2017,  the  SMM  OSCE  recorded  over  26,000  ceasefire 
violations - a 25 percent increase compared to the previous two weeks. On 11 December 
the SMM recorded over 3,500 ceasefire violations alone. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1"> Following the recommitment to cease fire from 00:00 on 23 December the SMM recorded 
328  ceasefire  violations  throughout  the  first  24  hours.  On  24  December  the  Mission 
recorded a significant decrease – 64 ceasefire violations. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> From 11 to 24 December the violence resulted in a number of civilian casualties, with one 
person killed and 20 injured. This brings the total number of civilian casualties confirmed by 
the  SMM  from  the  beginning of  this  year as  of  24  December  2017  to 470, including 85 
fatalities. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3"> From 11 to 17 December, the Mission monitored and facilitated 30 “windows of silence” – 
localized  adherence  to  the  ceasefire  –  which  allowed  for  inspection,  repair  and 
maintenance  work  on  ten  critical  civilian  infrastructure  facilities  on  both  sides  of  the 
contact  line.  On  14  December,  the  SMM  facilitated  and  monitored  repairs  of  essential 
infrastructure near Zalizne, Artema and Vesela Hora. However, following the withdrawal of 
the  Russian  Federation  Armed  Forces  officers  of  the  Joint  Centre  for  Control  and  Co-
ordination  (JCCC) on 18 December,  no such  works  were conducted between  18 and 24 December.

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The majority of recorded ceasefire violations were concentrated in five known “hot-spots” 
along  the  contact  line;  the  violence  was  particularly  heavy  in  the  areas  of  Avdiivka, 
Yasynuvata and Donetsk airport; areas south and south-east of Svitlodarsk and the Popasna
-Pervomaisk area.
