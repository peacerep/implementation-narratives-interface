<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 27 November and 10 December, the security situation in eastern Ukraine further deteriorated.  The  SMM  recorded  close  to  19,700  ceasefire  violations  in  total  –  a  25% increase  on  the  previous  two  weeks.  The  vast  majority  of  recorded  ceasefire  violations were  concentrated  in  the  Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-Donetsk  airport  area;  areas  south-west, south, and south-east of Svitlodarsk; the Popasna-Pervomaisk area; areas east and north-east of Mariupol; and the western and northern outskirts of Horlivka.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The SMM’s freedom of movement  remained restricted on both sides of the contact line, especially  around  Travneve,  where  mines  and  unexploded  ordnance  prevented  repeated attempts to enter the village, and  close to the  border areas with the Russian Federation around  Siedove  (southern  Donetsk  region),  where  patrols  have  been  consistently  denied access by armed members of  the “DPR” since April 2017. The SMM faced impediments in the  air  as  well,  with  one  of  its  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  being  fired  upon  while  in  non-government-controlled Dovhe on 27 November.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  From 27 November to 10 December, the Mission monitored and facilitated 54 “windows of silence”  –  localized  adherence  to  the  ceasefire  –  which  allow  for  inspection,  repair,  and maintenance work on 17 critical infrastructure facilities on both sides of the contact line. On 9 December, the SMM facilitated and monitored adherence to the ceasefire in order to carry  out  long  overdue  repairs  to  the  wooden  ramps  at  the  Stanytsia  Luhanska  bridge, which will bring greater safety to thousands of people who pass through the nearby entry-exit checkpoint on a daily basis.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  As part  of the “16 Days of Activism Against  Gender-Based Violence” campaign, the SMM organized  a  number  of  activities,  including  OSCE  Cafés  throughout  Ukraine,  focus  group discussions,  and  presentations  at  educational  institutions  featuring  a  range  of  guest speakers and interlocutors aiming to jointly raise awareness of the impact of gender-based violence, particularly in the context of armed conflict situations.</a></p>
