mations inside the disengagement area near Petrivske.

<p><a id="5" name="5"> Over  the  past  two  weeks,  the  SMM  corroborated  nine  civilian  casualties,  including  two 
fatalities.</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">This brings the total number of civilian casualties since the beginning of 2021 to 
33 (11 fatalities and 22 injuries).

<p><a id="7" name="7"> During a five-day official visit to Ukraine, Secretary General Helga Maria Schmid stressed 
that “the SMM must be able to work safely, securely, and unhindered on both sides of the 
contact line.”</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">She also noted the continuing  impact of landmines on the civilian popula-
tion, as highlighted by the Mission’s latest thematic report.</a></p>

<p><a id="10" name="10"> The  Mission’s  freedom  of  movement  was  restricted  28  times,  27  of  which  in  non-
government-controlled  areas,  including  once  when  members  of  the  armed  formations 
denied the SMM passage at a checkpoint near Olenivka, Donetsk region (see Spot Report 
15/2021).

<p><a id="12" name="12"> SMM unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were targeted by small-arms fire, five times in non
-government-controlled  areas  and  once  in  government-controlled  areas.  </a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">The  Mission’s 
UAVs  experienced  signal  interference  assessed  as  caused  by  probable  jamming  or  jam-
ming on 133 occasions on both sides of the contact line, including 30 instances when long-
range UAVs were affected (forcing one emergency landing during which the aircraft sus-
tained damage, see the Mission’s Spot Report 14/2021). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14"> The SMM continued to observe civilians crossing, or attempting to cross, the contact line 
and  the  challenges  they  face.  </a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">It  again  noted  that  the  only  crossing  points  civilians  were 
able  to  use  were  near  Stanytsia  Luhanska  (open  daily)  and  Novotroitske/Olenivka  (open 
twice a week, as the armed formations’ corresponding checkpoint there is only open on 
Mondays and Fridays).
