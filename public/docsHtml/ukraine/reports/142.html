<p><a id="0" name="0">  The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM) observed a  high  level 
of ceasefire violations in Donetsk region with violence concentrated around the 
usual hotspots: the  Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-Donetsk  airport  triangle; the  western 
and northern outskirts of Horlivka; areas around Shyrokyne and Kominternove; 
and the Svitlodarsk-Debaltseve road.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  Since  9  July  the  SMM  have  seen  a  sharp  increase  of  ceasefire  violations  in 
Luhansk  region. A major rise in violence was noted in Stanytsia Luhanska  – at 
the  only  authorized  route  for  crossing  the  contact  line  in  the  entire  Luhansk 
region. Violence also erupted around Shchastia where significant clashes were 
recorded on the night of 16-17-July.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  SMM  observed  numerous  weapons  missing  from  storage  sites  and  the 
presence  of  weapons  in  violation  of  withdrawal  lines,  quite  often  in  or  near 
residential areas.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  Freedom  of  movement  of  SMM  monitors  continued  to  be  restricted,             

particularly  in  areas  not  controlled  by  the  Government.  The  restrictions         
included: denial of access, jamming of SMM Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, a lack 
of security guarantees from the sides, and direct threats to monitors’ security 
through the positioning and firing of weapons close to an SMM forward patrol 
base.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  On  12  July  OSCE  SMM  Chief  Monitor  Ertugrul  Apakan  called  for  a  full  and      

sustainable ceasefire. See: www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/253131

<p><a id="5" name="5">  On  the  second  anniversary  of  the  MH17  tragedy  on  17  July,  Apakan  said  the 
disaster  is  a  reminder  that  civilians  pay  a  heavy  toll  in  armed  conflict.  See:
