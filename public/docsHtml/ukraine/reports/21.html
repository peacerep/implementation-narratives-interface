<p><a id="0" name="0">  The  OSCE  Special  Monitoring  Mission  (SMM)  to  Ukraine  observed  increased violence,  in  particular  in  the  Donetsk  region.  More  than  half  of  all  ceasefire    violations  registered  in  Donetsk  region  were  recorded  in  the  Yasynuvata-Avdiivka area. Significant fighting was also observed in Svitlodarsk, areas north-west  of  Donetsk  city  and  at  Donetsk  airport.  The  SMM  also  noted  a  rise  in    ceasefire violations in southern Donetsk region.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The situation in Luhansk region remained relatively calm with the exception of a spike in violence on 31 March–1 April in the areas of Pervomaisk and Stakhanov. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The SMM continued to note the presence and use of proscribed weapons within the security zone. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  presence  of  unexploded  ordnance  and  mines  remains  a  problem.  The    deadline agreed in Minsk for completing the marking, fencing off and mapping of areas close to entry-exit civilian checkpoints along the contact line expired on 31  March.  So  far  the  SMM  has  seen  no  systematic  efforts  by  the  sides  to       complete these actions.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  On  31  March,  the  SMM  monitored  the  situation  affecting  stranded  civilians  at checkpoints  in  Zolote.  Ukrainian  Armed  Forces  had  earlier  announced  the    opening  of  a  new  checkpoint  enabling  civilians  to  cross  the  contact  line  but armed “LPR” members, citing security concerns, denied them passage. This left over 300 civilians stranded on the road between the two checkpoints. The SMM   liaised  with  Ukrainian  authorities  to  transport  the  civilians,  many  of  them      elderly, back to government-controlled areas. </a></p>
