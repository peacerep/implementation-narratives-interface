gagement areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">While it observed a calm situation inside the disengagement area near 
Stanytsia  Luhanska,  it  spotted  the  presence  of  people  inside  the  disengagement  areas

</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">The  SMM  observed  instances  when  civilians  were  denied  entry  into  government-
controlled  and  non-government  controlled  areas,  thus  finding  themselves  stranded  in 
the area between forward checkpoints.</a></p>

armed  formations  near  non-government-controlled  Olenivka  opened  to  civilians  cross-
