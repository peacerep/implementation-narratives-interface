<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 19 April and 2 May 2021, the SMM noted a reduction in the number of ceasefire violations – recording 3,135 of them, compared with 3,828 in the previous two-week peri-od. In an address to the OSCE Permanent Council on 22 April, the SMM Chief Monitor stated that the Mission had over the previous few months observed intensification and “a broad-ening of kinetic activities along the contact line,” and increased numbers of civilian casual-ties and damaged or destroyed civilian infrastructure. As these developments unfold, the Mission is facing near-unprecedented restrictions and impediments to its ability to oper-ate, many of which appear both deliberate and targeted.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  Over the past two weeks, the SMM corroborated seven civilian casualties, including three fatalities due to the detonation of hand grenades in Donetsk region. This brings the total number of civilian casualties that occurred since the beginning of 2021 to 16 (seven fatali-ties and nine injuries).

<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  Mission’s  freedom  of  movement  on  the  ground  was  restricted  14  times,  11  in  non-government-controlled  areas,  including  once  when  members  of  the  armed  formations again conditioned passage through their checkpoints on the contact line on visual inspec-tion of SMM vehicles (see Spot Report 12/2021). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAV)  were  targeted  12  times  by  small-arms  fire,  seven times in government-controlled areas, four times in non-government-controlled areas and once  over  a  contested  area  near  Zaitseve  (50km  north-east  of  Donetsk).  The  Mission’s UAVs  experienced  signal  interference  assessed  as  caused  by  probable  jamming  or  jam-ming  on  146  occasions,  including  10  instances  when  long-range  UAVs  were  affected (forcing one cancelled flight and one emergency landing (see Spot Report 11/2021)).  
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote and Petrivske, observing people in the latter two areas and recording one ceasefire viola-tion inside the disengagement area near Zolote and 12 inside the one near Petrivske. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The SMM continued to observe civilians while crossing, or attempting to cross, the contact line and their challenges. It again noted that the only crossing points civilians were able to use  were  near  Stanytsia  Luhanska  (opened  daily)  and  Novotroitske/Olenivka  (twice  a week, as the armed formations’ checkpoint there is only open on Mondays and Fridays).  
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The Mission continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to ena-ble  repairs  to  and  maintenance  and  operation  of  critical  civilian  infrastructure  on  both sides  of  the  contact  line,  including  maintenance  of  the  phenol  sludge  reservoir  near Zalizne  (formerly  Artemove)  and  emergency  repairs  to  a  water  installation  near  Yasyn-uvata. </a></p>
