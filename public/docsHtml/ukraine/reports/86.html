<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  20  May  and  2  June,  the  SMM  recorded  almost  11,000  ceasefire  violations 
(around 14,000 in the previous two-week period); and observed 60 weapons in violation 
of the agreed withdrawal lines. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The Mission also recorded almost 70 instances in which weapons that should have been 
withdrawn  were  used  (mostly  mortars  and  artillery  in  the  vicinity  of  Svitlodarsk  and 
Popasna).  

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> In the past two weeks, the SMM confirmed that five civilians were injured. In Horlivka, a 
woman  sustained  shrapnel  injuries.  Her  five-year-old  granddaughter  was  admitted  to 
hospital with incident-related shock. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  Near  the  border  with  the  Russian  Federation  in  non-government-controlled  areas  of 
Luhansk, where there are no border crossing facilities, an SMM long-range UAV spotted 
trucks travelling west on a dirt track on two occasions.   

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4"> In areas close to the contact line, the SMM continued to note humanitarian problems, 
now exacerbated by high summer temperatures. In several settlements, including Oboz-
ne,  Khrystove,  Svitle,  Zoria,  and  Petrivka,  residents  told  the  SMM  about  a  shortage  or 
absence of running water. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The SMM continued to enable repairs to infrastructure on both sides of the contact line, 
including  the  pumping  station  near  Artema,  a  gas  pipeline  in  Vesela  Hora,  the  phenol 
sludge reservoir near Zalizne, a gas distribution station near Sakhanka, and power lines 
in Zaitseve.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The Mission monitored adherence to the ceasefire during a transfer of persons convict-
ed before the conflict from non-government-controlled areas, as well as facilitated and 
monitored  a  transfer  of  human  remains  across  the  contact  line  of  a  member  of  the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces and a civilian.
