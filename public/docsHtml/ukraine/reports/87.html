<p><a id="0" name="0"> The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM) reported that the 
levels of ceasefire violations fluctuated but remained high, with hundreds of 
violations recorded on a daily basis. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1"> Around half of all ceasefire violations recorded by the SMM were registered in 
the Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-Donetsk airport area. The remainder were spread 
among four other hotspots: areas east and north-east of Mariupol; the western 
and northern outskirts of Horlivka; in the western part of Luhansk region and 
along the Svitlodarsk-Debaltseve road. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> Starting from 18 December the SMM observed an increase in ceasefire 
violations in the areas around Svitlodarsk and Debaltseve.

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3"> In the week of 12-18 December the use of the weapons proscribed by the 
Minsk agreements tripled compared with the previous week.

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4"> Freedom of movement of SMM monitors continued to be restricted, in 
particular in and around disengagement areas – where the sides refuse to 
remove mines and unexploded ordnance – and sometimes at weapons storage 
sites. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5"> Civilians continued to be endangered as the sides placed positions close to 
residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, exposing them to shelling. 
Passing checkpoints along the contact line also remained dangerous for 
civilians who had to wait for lengthy periods in areas that often lack adequate 
shelter, water or sanitary resources, and occasionally come under fire.
