<p><a id="0" name="0">  The  OSCE  Special  Monitoring  Mission  to  Ukraine  (SMM)  observed  a  significant 
increase  in  the  number  of  ceasefire  violations  in  both  Donetsk  and  Luhansk   
regions. Most violence occurred around Donetsk airport; government-controlled 
Avdiivka,  “DPR”-controlled  Yasynuvata;  on  the  road  between  “DPR”-controlled 
Debaltseve  and  government-controlled  Svitlodarsk;  and  in  the  area  around  the 
bridge south of government-controlled Stanytsia Luhanska.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  SMM  continued  to  note  a  tense  situation  in  the  Berezove-Dokuchaievsk  
area, approximately 30km south-west of Donetsk. Eight thousand people in the 
area  –  on  both  sides  of  the  contact  line  –  are  without  potable  water  since  15 
April.  Near  government-controlled  Berezove,  repair  work  required  to  fix          
electricity  lines  downed  by  shelling  is  impossible  because  the  area  is  heavily 
mined.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  SMM  observed  numerous  weapons  missing  from  storage  sites  and  the    

presence of weapons in violation of withdrawal lines.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  Freedom of movement of SMM monitors continued to be restricted, particularly 

in areas not controlled by the government.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  On  27  May  SMM  monitors  were  fired  upon (See spot report: www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/243366).  In  the  reporting  period  two  SMM  long-range  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  were lost  over  “DPR”-controlled  areas 
(see Spot Reports: www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/244576 and www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/243361 ).
