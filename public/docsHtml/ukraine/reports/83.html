The  majority  of  explosions  have  been  attributed  to  demining  and  most firing  incidents  to  training  activities.  Nonetheless,  there  were  a  number  of      serious  incidents  mostly  at  and  around  the  Donetsk  airport  that  could  not  be attributed to such activities, some involving fatalities.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  On  22-26  October  OSCE  SMM  Deputy  Chief  Monitor  Alexander  Hug  visited    Donetsk  region.  He  and  the  SMM  team  there  met  with  internally  displaced    persons  from  Pisky.  Moreover,  for  the  first  time  in  the  past  two  and  half  months, the SMM was able to access “DPR“-controlled Debaltseve, where local   residents appeared to be maintaining a very basic existence. Hug also met with interlocutors  to  solicit  support  for  opening  additional  SMM  Forward  Patrol   Bases  and  evaluated  several  potential  locations  for  these  bases  in  Donetsk    region.
