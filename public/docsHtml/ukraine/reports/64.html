<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 4 and 17 October, the SMM recorded a slight decrease in the number of cease-

fire violations – 4,193 compared with 4,324 in the previous two-week period. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The SMM issued a statement regarding the incident which took place in the disengage-

ment area near Zolote on 13 October. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  From the morning of 15 to 18 October (and continuing outside the reporting period), in 
front of the hotel where Mission members reside in the central part of non-government-
controlled Donetsk city, the SMM observed a round-the-clock gathering of between ten 
and  350  people.  As  a  result  of  this  protest,  the  SMM  was  unable  to  deploy  its  regular 
patrols from that location to conduct its mandated tasks.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  Members of the armed formations prevented the SMM from leaving its Forward Patrol 
Base  in  non-government-controlled  Horlivka,  Donetsk  region,  from  17  to  18  October 
(outside  of  the  reporting  period).  Since  18  October,  the  SMM  resumed  patrolling  (see 
Spot Reports 20/2021 and 22/2021). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The patrolling from other SMM locations continued as normal. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  Overall during the two-week period, the Mission’s freedom of movement was restricted 
33 times, including 29 instances in non-government-controlled areas. In particular, on 17 
October, at a checkpoint near Kreminets, members of the armed formations denied the 
SMM  passage  towards  government-controlled  areas  (see  Spot  Report  21/2021).  SMM 
unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAVs)  were  assessed  as  targeted  by  small-arms  fire  twice: 
once  in  government-controlled  and  once  in  non-government-controlled  areas.  Mission 
UAVs experienced signal interference, assessed as caused by probable jamming on 144 
occasions, including 39 instances experienced by long-range UAVs, while flying on both 
sides of the contact line.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The  Mission  continued  to  monitor  the  disengagement  areas  near  Stanytsia  Luhanska, 
Zolote and Petrivske. It again recorded ceasefire violations inside and close to the disen-
gagement  areas  near  Zolote  and  Petrivske  as  well  as  close  to  the  disengagement  area 
near Stanytsia Luhanska. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">  The SMM corroborated reports of six civilian casualties  – four due to the detonation of 
explosive  objects  and  two  due  to  shelling.  This  brings  the  total  number  of  confirmed 
civilian casualties since the beginning of 2021 to 78 (15 fatalities and 63 injured).  

</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">  The SMM continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to enable 
repairs and operation of critical civilian infrastructure on both sides of the contact line, 
including  repairs  to  power  lines near  Luhanske  and  to  a  power substation  in  Pikuzy,  as 
well as repairs to water infrastructure in Zolote-5/Mykhailivka and Katerynivka.
