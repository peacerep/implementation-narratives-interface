<p><a id="0" name="0">  The  OSCE  SMM  continued  to  monitor  the  security  situation,  registering  a  high number  of  ceasefire  violations  along  the  contact  line  in  eastern  Ukraine.            Violations  include  the  use  of  weapons  proscribed  by  the  Minsk  agreements, namely mortars, artillery, tanks and multiple launch rocket systems.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The violence was concentrated around well-known hotspots, particularly in the Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-Donetsk  airport  area  and  in  areas  east  and  north-east  of Mariupol.  The  situation  in  Luhansk  region  was  relatively  calm  with  limited     violence  in  and  around  Stanytsia  Luhanska,  and  in  areas  in  the  west  of  the     region. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  humanitarian  situation  of  the  civilian  population  remains  dire,  with  water and  electricity  shortages  particularly  evident  in  areas  of  Luhansk  region  not   controlled by the Government. This is the result of the failure to resolve utility bill payment issues.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  With  the  sides  continuing  to  position  and  use  hardware  in  and  around              residential  areas,  civilians  invariably  bear  the  brunt  of  continued  shelling  and other  ceasefire  violations.  As  well  as  causing  civilian  casualties  and  damaging homes  and  schools,  critical  civilian  infrastructure  has  been  badly  affected,     resulting in further disruptions to utility supplies.
