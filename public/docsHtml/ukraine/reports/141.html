<p><a id="0" name="0">  The security situation in eastern Ukraine has slowly but steadily deteriorated despite the 
sides’  recommitment  to  the  ceasefire  in  late  August.  Notably,  during  the  week  of  23  to  
29  October  the  SMM  recorded  more  than  5,000  ceasefire  violations,  an  increase  of          
80  per  cent  over  the  previous  week.  Most  violations  were  recorded  in  the  areas  of      
Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-Donetsk airport and Svitlodarsk-Debaltseve.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  At the same time, the Mission recorded a decrease of more than 50 per cent in the use of 

Minsk-proscribed  weapons  in  the  week  of  23  to  29  October,  compared  to  the  week     
before.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  From  16  to  29  October,  the  Mission  confirmed  nine  civilian  casualties,  including  one    

fatality.  A  25-year-old  man  died  from  a  bullet  wound,  which  he  had  sustained  in  the 
Trudivski area of Donetsk city. This brings the total number of civilian casualties recorded 
this year to 411.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  SMM,  in  co-ordination  with  the  Joint  Centre  for  Control  and  Co-ordination,  also contributed  to  the  improvement  of  the  humanitarian  situation  by  facilitating  and        
monitoring localized adherence to the ceasefire. From 16 to 29 October, these “windows 
of  silence”  allowed  for  inspection,  repair  and  maintenance  work  to  15  infrastructure      
facilities.   

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4"> In the past two weeks the SMM facilitated and monitored repairs and maintenance work 
to the water wells near Krasnyi Lyman, the power lines in Druzhba, the Donetsk Filtration 
Station, the thermal power plant in Shchastia, the Petrivske water pumping station, and 
other essential civilian infrastructure. In total, the Mission conducted at least 32 patrols in 
support of repairs and maintenance of infrastructure facilities. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The SMM’s access remained restricted in multiple locations on both sides of the contact 
line,  in  particular  in  areas  outside  of  government  control  close  to  the  border  with  the 
Russian  Federation.  At  a  “DPR”-controlled  checkpoint  near  Verkhnoshyrokivske  armed 
men  in  military-style  clothing  pointed  a  heavy  machine-gun  at  an  SMM  patrol:

<p><a id="6" name="6">  The SMM has also monitored public gatherings across the country, including one in front 

of the national parliament building in Kyiv.
