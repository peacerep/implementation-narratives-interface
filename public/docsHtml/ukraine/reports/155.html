<p><a id="0" name="0">  On 29 September participants of the Trilateral Contact Group’s working group on 
security issues finalized their work on a long-awaited Addendum to the  February 
Package  of  Measures.  The  Addendum  is  a  plan  for  withdrawal  to  a  distance  of 
15km  for  tanks,  artillery  pieces  up  to  100mm  in  calibre,  and  mortars  up  to  and 
including 120mm. SMM Chief Monitor Ertugrul Apakan welcomed the agreement 
in a statement the following day.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  On 1-3 October OSCE SMM Deputy Chief Monitor Alexander Hug visited Luhansk 
to  assess  the  general  security  situation  in  the  region  and  meet  with  the  SMM 
team. The SMM patrol with  Hug attempted to reach the international border but 
was  prevented  from  proceeding  by  “LPR”  “border  guards”.  Hug  also  met  with         
interlocutors to solicit support for opening the SMM Forward Patrol Bases in the 
Luhansk region.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  On  4  October  the  SMM  started  to  monitor  the  withdrawal  of  weapons  as         

required under the Addendum to the Package of Measures.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  ceasefire  largely  continued  to  hold,  with  few  incidents  recorded,  most  of 
which  were  assessed  to  have  involved  the  use  of  small-arms  or  to  have  likely 
been part of training or demining activities. Heavy weapons, however, remained 
ever-present, constituting a risk of escalation.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMM held a workshop for its newly-established Kyiv Youth Contact Group on 
26-28  September.  As  a  result  of  the  workshop the  participants  presented  two 
projects to foster dialogue in Kyiv and in eastern Ukraine. In the coming months 
they  will  work  together  with  SMM  members  to  implement  their  ideas.  Learn
