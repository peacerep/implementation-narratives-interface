<p><a id="0" name="0"> Between 28 January and 10 February, the SMM recorded over 10,400 ceasefire violations (compared with almost 9,500 in the previous two-week period); and observed 130 weap-ons in violation of the agreed withdrawal lines (53 in areas not controlled by the Govern-ment). In a number of incidents, civilians were directly impacted. School children in Zolote were  sent  home  following  shelling  in  the  area;  workers  preparing  for  a  funeral  in  Cher-malyk came under small-arms fire and required SMM facilitation before reaching safety; and a truck driver delivering humanitarian aid near Kadiivka was subjected to small-arms fire.

<p><a id="1" name="1"> The SMM corroborated the deaths of two elderly people attempting to cross the contact line, taking the number of cases to 14 since late December 2018. The Mission continued to  observe  long  queues  of  civilians  at  entry-exit  checkpoints.  Separately,  the  Ukrainian State Border Guard Service told the SMM that about 37,000 crossings of the contact line had  been  made  by  civilians  every  day  in  2018,  amounting  to  over  13  million  crossings throughout the year.

<p><a id="2" name="2"> The  Mission  facilitated  and  monitored  localized  adherence  to  the  ceasefire  on  47  occa-sions  to  enable  repairs  to  15  civilian  infrastructure  facilities  along  the  contact  line  and continued  to  facilitate  the  operation  of  the  Donetsk  Filtration  Station.  Within  the  re-porting period, repair work was completed to a water pipeline near Berezove, which pro-vides potable water to around 10,000 civilians on both sides of the contact line, and pow-er lines in Katerynivka, allowing for the restoration of electricity to about 500 residents.
