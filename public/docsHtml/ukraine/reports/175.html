<p><a id="0" name="0"> Between 6 and 19 August, the SMM noted continued violence along the 
contact line, in particular in areas east and north-east of Mariupol. In all, the 
Mission recorded over 12,500 ceasefire violations. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1"> The SMM continued to observe weapons in violation of agreed withdrawal 
lines (155 over the two-week period (61 in areas not controlled by the 
Government)). It also noted large amounts of hardware being routed through 
government-controlled Kostiantynivka, and convoys of trucks entering and 
exiting Ukraine via a dirt track where there are no border crossing facilities in a 
non-government-controlled area of Donetsk region. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> In addition to the ongoing threats posed by the presence of mines and 
unexploded ordnance – which the sides are obliged to remove – SMM 
monitors faced other threats, including one incident involving shots being fired 
and explosions occurring in their vicinity (Spot Report, www.osce.org/specialmonitoring-mission-to-ukraine/390878). In another incident, a member of the 
armed formations, having first disengaged the safety of his assault rifle, 
pointed the weapon at SMM monitors (Spot Report, www.osce.org/specialmonitoring-mission-to-ukraine/390287).

<p><a id="3" name="3"> On 19 August the SMM monitored the “Odessa Pride March” organized by the 
lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender (LGBT) community in Odessa. The 
Mission is following up on a number of alleged hate crimes that occurred 
during the reporting period involving members of the LGBT community in Lviv 
and Mariupol.</a></p>
