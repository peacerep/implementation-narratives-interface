<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 15 and 28 June, the SMM recorded about 8,700 ceasefire violations, including 
about 4,700 explosions, compared with approximate 6,850 and about 2,750 in the previ-
ous two-week period, respectively. The Pervomaisk-Popasna-Zolote area was one of the 
main hotspots (about 60 per cent of the bi-weekly total of ceasefire violations).

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The Mission continued monitoring the security situation in and around the three disen-
gagement areas. While it observed a calm situation inside the disengagement area near 
Stanytsia  Luhanska,  it  spotted  the  presence  of  people  inside  the  disengagement  areas 
near  Zolote  and  Petrivske,  as  well  as  recent  extensions  of  positions  of  the  armed  for-
mations inside the disengagement area near Petrivske.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  On 22 June, the SMM lost the video feed from its daylight camera located 1km south-
west of Shyrokyne and about 3km from the contact line (see Spot Report 33/2020). The 
SMM ground patrols assessed the damage as caused by a round from an undetermined 
weapon.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The Mission corroborated reports of three civilian casualties, including a case of a man 
who died from shrapnel injuries in Oleksandrivka. This brings the total since the begin-
ning of 2020 to 54 (7 fatalities and 47 injuries).  

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMM continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to ena-
ble repairs to, and construction and maintenance of, critical civilian infrastructure. This 
included  repairs  to  water  infrastructure  near  Maiorsk,  Shumy  and  near  Zolote-5/
Mykhailivka, benefitting over 3 million civilians on both sides of the contact line.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The  Mission  continued  to  monitor  the  situation  of  civilians  at  entry-exit  checkpoints 
(EECP) along the contact line as a result of measures taken amid the COVID-19 outbreak. 
The  SMM  observed  instances  when  civilians  were  denied  entry  into  government-
controlled  and  non-government  controlled  areas,  thus  finding  themselves  stranded  in 
the area between forward checkpoints. On 22 June, the corresponding checkpoint of the 
armed  formations  near  non-government-controlled  Olenivka  opened  to  civilians  cross-
ing into government-controlled areas. However, on 28 June, the EECP was closed until 
further notice. The SMM observed Stanytsia Luhanska EECP open to civilians travelling in 
both directions.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  On 24 June, the SMM monitored military-style parades marking Victory Day in Donetsk 

and Luhansk cities, reporting 3,000 to 5,000 onlookers in both.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">  Members of the armed formations continued to deny the SMM passage at checkpoints 
along official crossing routes  in the Donetsk and the Luhansk  regions (see  Spot Report 
32/2020  and  Spot  Report  34/2020).  Overall,  the  Missionâ€™s  freedom  of  movement  was 
restricted  40  times  (all  in  non-government-controlled  areas).  SMM  unmanned  aerial 
vehicles  were  subjected  to  signal  interference  on  both  sides  of  the  contact  line  on  27 
occasions,  and  were  targeted  by  small-arms  fire  three  times  (all  in  non-government-
controlled areas).
