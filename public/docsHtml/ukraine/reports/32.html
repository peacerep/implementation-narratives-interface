<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  14  and  27  October,  the  SMM  recorded  about  16,200  ceasefire  violations,  in-
cluding  about  3,500  explosions.  This  compares  with  about  17,000  ceasefire  violations,

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  Mission  confirmed  reports  of  14  civilian  casualties,  all  injuries,  including  five  boys 
and  two  girls  injured  by  mines  and  unexploded  ordnance  (UXO).  Children,  especially 
boys, are often drawn to mines  and UXO, mistaking  them for toys or objects of value. 
Since  the  beginning  of  2019,  the  SMM  has  confirmed  137  civilian  casualties  (16  killed, 
121 injured).

<p><a id="2" name="2">  The SMM saw damage caused by small-arms fire to two functioning schools in Oleksan-
drivka and Zolote. Since the beginning of the year, the SMM has observed damage to 14 
operational educational facilities, including 11 schools and three kindergartens, on both 
sides of the contact line due to shelling and small-arms fire. Other civilian properties in 
settlements  located  along  the  contact  line  also  continue  to  be  exposed,  including  in 
Dokuchaievsk, where  in 2019, the SMM has  seen damage from shelling and gunfire to 
50 civilian properties. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  SMM  continued  facilitating  the  repair  and  maintenance  of  essential  civilian  infra-
structure on both sides of the contact line, including repairs ensuring the supply of wa-
ter to more than 150,000 civilians.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  The  SMM  recorded  no  ceasefire  violations  inside  or  within  the  5km  periphery  of  the 
Stanytsia Luhanska  disengagement area. Inside  the area, the Mission continued to ob-
serve  workers  from  government-controlled  areas  repairing  the  broken  section  of  the 
Stanytsia Luhanska bridge.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  On 29 October (outside the reporting period), the SMM  saw that disengagement from 
the  Zolote  disengagement  area  had  begun.  Additional  SMM  patrols,  assisted  by  static 
cameras and unmanned aerial vehicles, observed the launch of flares by the Ukrainian 
Armed Forces and the armed formations, signalling both sidesâ€™ readiness to disengage, 
and  subsequently  Ukrainian  Armed  Forces  personnel  and  members  of  the  armed  for-
mations exiting the disengagement area, together with their weapons. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  On 25 October, in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa and Zaporizhzhia, the SMM observed peaceful 
gatherings  of  about  80-150  people  (mostly  men),  expressing  messages  critical  of  the 
recent developments concerning certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
