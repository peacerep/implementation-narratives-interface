<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  19  March  and  1  April  2018,  the  security  situation  in  the  east  of  Ukraine  remained tense  and  continued  to  gradually  deteriorate.  Overall,  the  number  of  ceasefire  violations  in the two-week reporting period reached almost 10,000 (compared to 4,300 in the previous two weeks). This number includes more than 1,000 ceasefire violations recorded in the three days following a renewed commitment to the ceasefire that took effect at 00:01 (Kyiv time) on 30 March.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  OSCE  SMM’s  freedom  of  movement  remained  restricted  due  to  the  presence  of  mines and  unexploded  ordnance  on  both  sides  of  the  contact  line,  as  well  as  due  to  the  denial  of access by the sides (mainly in areas not  controlled by the Government). For instance,  on 23 March,  small  arms  were  fired  near  an  SMM  patrol  in  Pikuzy  and  the  SMM  heard  impacts assessed  as  ricochets  of  two  bullets  5-10m  north  of  its  position.  On  30  March,  three  SMM unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) were fired at over non-government-controlled areas.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  On  28  March,  the  Mission  re-introduced  the  use  of  long-range  UAVs.  With  a  range  of  over 160km, the SMM’s long-range UAVs will operate over Donetsk and Luhansk regions equally on both  sides  of  the  contact  line,  including  at night  when  ground  patrolling  is  restricted  due  to security considerations.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  Violence in the east of Ukraine resulted in a number of civilian casualties. From the beginning of 2018 to 1 April the Mission corroborated 37 civilian casualties, including 8 killed.
