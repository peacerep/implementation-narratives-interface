<p><a id="0" name="0">  The  OSCE  Special  Monitoring  Mission  to  Ukraine  (SMM)  continued  to  observe 
violence  in  many  parts  of  Donbas.  Reflecting  a  high  degree  of  volatility  and   
unpredictability,  the  SMM  on  some  days  recorded  fewer  than  ten  explosions 
whilst on others, over 100.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  Yasynuvata-Avdiivka  area  north  of  Donetsk  city  and  areas  south-east  of  

Svitlodarsk  remained  hotspots,  with  areas  around  Donetsk  airport  again         
becoming more tense. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  Luhansk region remained relatively calm, with sporadic violence in the region’s 

west and occasional intense fighting immediately south of Stanytsia Luhanska. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  Weapons continued to be observed in the security zone. Significant numbers of 

weapons were still missing from holding areas and permanent storage sites.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  On 20 May in violation of the Package of Measures for the Implementation of 
the  Minsk  Agreements,  armed  “DPR”  members  cut  the  power  supply  to  an 
SMM  repeater  device  in  Donetsk  city,  thereby  incapacitating  SMM  remote   
monitoring  equipment  at  “DPR”-controlled  Oktiabr  mine  and  in  government-
controlled Avdiivka.
