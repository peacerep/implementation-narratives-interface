<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  5  and  18  February,  the  security  situation  in  eastern  Ukraine  remained  volatile. 
Periods  of  relative  calm  were  interrupted  by  sudden  violent  flare-ups,  in  particular  in  the 
Svitlodarsk-Debaltseve area, in the west of Luhansk region and in areas east and north-east of 
Mariupol. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  On one particular day, 7 February, the Mission recorded 360 instances of the use of multiple 

launch rocket systems: the highest number observed on a single day since March 2017. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  Much  of  the  violence  occurred  in  rural  areas,  resulting  in  four  injuries.  There  were  three 
children  among  them,  who  were  injured  in  an  incident  involving  unexploded  ordnance  in 
Krasnohorivka  on  6  February.  The  failure  of  the  sides  to  remove  mines  and  other  explosive 
remnants  of  war  remains  a  constant  feature.  It  is  an  ever-present  threat  to  civilians, 
particularly children, as well as to SMM monitors.

<p><a id="3" name="3"> In  addition  to  the  risk  posed  by  mines  and  unexploded  ordnance,  the  Mission  –  both  its 
monitoring  officers  and  its  equipment  –  was  targeted  or  endangered  a  number  of  times  by 
small-arms  fire.  Armed  “DPR”  members  fired  shots  close  to  SMM  monitors,  and  SMM 
unmanned aerial vehicles were fired upon four times, twice on each side of the contact line.  
In  addition  to  the  presence  of  mines,  the  Mission’s  freedom  of  movement  was  directly 
restricted  by  the  sides:  twice  in  areas  controlled  by  the  government  and  37  times  in  areas 
outside government control. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  Between 5 and 18 February, the Mission facilitated and monitored 34 “windows of silence”  – 
localized adherence to the ceasefire – which allowed for repairs and maintenance work on 12 
critical civilian infrastructure  facilities on both sides of the contact line. In two cases  – at the 
water  wells  near  non-government-controlled  Krasnyi  Lyman  and  at  the  Petrivske  pumping 
station near government-controlled Artema – a quarter of a million people benefited from the 
repairs.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  Multiple  public  gatherings,  demonstrations  and  protests  took  place  on  17  and  18  February 
throughout Ukraine. One of them, involving approximately 70 participants, resulted in acts of 
vandalism against a number of buildings in Kyiv associated with the Russian Federation.
