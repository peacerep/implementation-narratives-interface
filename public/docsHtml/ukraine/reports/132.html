Repeatedly,  the  Mission  was  also  denied  access  to  locations    in  the  southern  areas  of  the  Donetsk  region.  The  SMM’s remote  observation  capabilities  were  also  impeded.  On  two  separate  occasions,        on  26  and  30  August  in  Yasynuvata,  armed  persons  prevented  the  SMM  from         conducting  an  unmanned  aerial  vehicle  (UAV)  flight  over  the  Donetsk  Filtration      Station,  threatening  to  shoot  down  the  UAV  and  citing  orders  from  superiors.  Aerial imagery  on  20  August  revealed  the  extension  of  a  trench  line  south-south-east  of     the Donetsk Filtration Station.</a></p>
