<p><a id="0" name="0">  For the eighteenth consecutive week, the security situation remained relatively calm 
following additional measures to strengthen the ceasefire that took effect on 27 July. 
Between  16  and  29  November,  the  SMM  recorded  341  ceasefire  violations,  com-
pared with 468 in the previous two-week period.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The Mission continued monitoring the security situation in and around the three pilot 
disengagement areas, recording no ceasefire violations inside any of them. Inside the 
area near Petrivske, on one occasion, SMM unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) spotted 
people near and inside former military-type positions of the armed formations. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The SMM corroborated reports of 13 civilian casualties, including three fatalities due 
to  the  detonation  of  an  explosive  device,  assessed  as  accidental,  on  30  October  in 
Horlivka. Seven of the 13 casualties were due to the detonation of explosive devices. 
Four casualties, all injuries, occurred prior to the additional measures that took effect 
on 27 July. The total number of civilian casualties since the beginning of 2020 stands 
at 116: 21 fatalities and 95 injuries.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The Mission  continued  seeing  anti-tank  mines  on  both sides  of  the  contact  line,  in-
cluding  near  roads  it  frequently  uses.  In  Donetsk  region,  the  SMM  saw  for  the  first 
time about 32 anti-tank mines in a field near the road between Pikuzy and Zaichenko, 
which it assessed as not recently laid, and again observed about 50 anti-tank mines in 
a field near Troitske. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The Mission continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to 
enable  repairs  to  and  maintenance  and  operation  of  critical  civilian  infrastructure, 
including to water infrastructure near Zolote-5/Mykhailivka, Pankivka, Slovianoserbsk 
and Krasnyi Lyman (benefitting over 300,000 civilians), and gas infrastructure in Loba-
cheve (which provides gas to around 200 people).  

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The  Mission  continued  to  observe  civilians  facing  challenges  when  crossing,  or 
attempting to cross the contact line in both directions. The SMM again noted that the 
only  crossing  points  where  civilians  were  able  to  use  continued  to  be  Stanytsia 
Luhanska  and  Novotroitske/Olenivka.  In  each  location,  limited  numbers  of  civilians 
were observed travelling in both directions.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The Missionâ€™s freedom of movement was restricted 18 times on the ground, all but 
three  times  in  non-government-controlled  areas.  SMM  UAVs  experienced  signal  in-
terference assessed as caused by probable jamming on 19 occasions while flying on 
both sides of the contact line.
