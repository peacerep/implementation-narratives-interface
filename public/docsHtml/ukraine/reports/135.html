<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 22 February and 7 March, the SMM noted a 54% reduction in the number  of  ceasefire  violations,  recording  944,  compared  with  2,048  in  the previous two-week period. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  On  7  March,  an  SMM  long-range  unmanned  aerial  vehicle  (UAV)  crashed near  Romanivka,  Donetsk  region.  The  aircraft  had  experienced  dual  GPS technical failure about an hour before crashing (see Spot Report 2/2021).  
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  SMM  continued  to  monitor  the  disengagement  areas  near  Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote and Petrivske, observing people in the latter two areas dur-ing  daytime.  Inside  the  area  near  Petrivske,  it  observed  previously  seen mines and recorded two ceasefire violations.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  During  the  two-week  reporting  period,  the  SMM  corroborated  no  civilian casualties; it has recorded only one injury that occurred since the beginning of 2021 (on 3 January). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The  Mission  continued  to  facilitate  and  monitor  adherence  to  localized ceasefires  to  enable  repairs  to  and  maintenance  and  operation  of  critical civilian  infrastructure  on both  sides  of  the  contact  line,  including  repairs  to power  lines  near  Shchastia,  Stepanivka  and  Almazna,  altogether  providing electricity for several hundred thousand civilians. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The SMM continued to observe civilians facing challenges when crossing, or attempting  to  cross,  the  contact  line.  It  again  noted  that  the  only  crossing points civilians were able to use were near Stanytsia Luhanska (operational daily)  and  Novotroitske/Olenivka  (twice  a  week  as  the  armed  formations’ checkpoint there is only operational on Mondays and Fridays).  
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The  Mission’s  freedom  of  movement  on  the  ground  was  restricted  nine times, all in  non-government-controlled  areas.  SMM  UAVs  experienced  sig-nal  interference  assessed  as  caused  by  probable  jamming  on  35  occasions while flying on both sides of the contact line. </a></p>
