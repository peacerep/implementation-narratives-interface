  Between 22 January and 4 February, the security situation in eastern Ukraine remained tense. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">In  terms  of  the  overall  number  of  ceasefire  violations  recorded  by  the  OSCE  SMM  along  the 
contact line, little changed between 19 February and 4 March 2018 compared with the previous 
two-week reporting period.</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The Mission did, however, observe localized upsurges in violence, in particular in the Popasna-
Pervomaisk area of western Luhansk region.</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">In the first week of the reporting period, almost 90 
percent of all explosions caused by weapons that should have been withdrawn according to the 
Minsk  agreements  were  recorded  in  this  area.  </a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">The  following  week,  the  majority  of  such 
explosions were recorded in areas south and south-east of Svitlodarsk, a change possibly due to 
the  fact  that  the  Mission’s  night-time  monitoring  capacity  in  and  around  Popasna  was 
compromised during this time.</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">  On  23  February,  the  SMM  from  its  forward  patrol  base  near  Popasna  heard  ten  explosions 
assessed as outgoing 120mm mortar rounds, thereby temporarily relocating its monitors from 
the  base,  which  has remained unstaffed then.</a></p>

  </a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">Armed  men  in  areas  close  to  the  border  with  the  Russian  Federation  in  non-government-
controlled areas of Luhansk  region repeatedly denied access to four specific locations.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">One of 
them,  near  Voznesenivka,  has  been  unreachable  for  the  Mission  since  15  February,  while 
another  town  in  southern  Donetsk  region  –  Siedove  –  has  been  similarly  closed  off  by  armed 
men  since  April  2017.  </a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">Furthermore,  since  the  beginning  of  the  year,  SMM  unmanned  aerial 
vehicles have been targeted by small-arms fire on ten occasions, including two times during the 
reporting period.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">In one incident on 26 February, prior to the unmanned aerial vehicle coming 
under  fire,  the  camera  on  board  recorded  the  presence  of  four  self-propelled  howitzers  in 
violation of the withdrawal lines in non-government-controlled Sarabash in Donetsk region.</a></p>

reflected in SMM daily reports, available in three languages (English, Ukrainian and Russian) on
