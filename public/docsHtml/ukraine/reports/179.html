<p><a id="0" name="0">  The  SMM  continued  to  monitor  the  situation  at  three  crossing  points  at  the       

administrative  boundary  line  between  the  mainland  and  Crimea.  The  Mission    
monitors  observed  that  the  situation  was  calm  and  all  three  crossing  points  at   
Kalanchak,  Chaplynka  and  Chonhar  had  re-opened.  The  SMM  did  not  observe  
increased military movements at the three crossing points and in adjacent areas.

Shyrokyne  and  Pikuzy  (formerly  Kominternove);  and  the  Svitlodarsk-Debaltseve
