<p><a id="1" name="1"> The  SMM  observed  mines  on  both  sides  of  the  contact  line,  including  an  anti-vehicle  mine 

(TM-83) near a road between Styla and Petrivske, and 46 anti-tank mines near Popasna.

<p><a id="2" name="2"> The Mission confirmed one civilian casualty – a 25-year-old woman killed in shelling in Shy-
roka Balka on 9 April – bringing the total since the beginning of 2020 to 29 (five fatalities and 
24 injuries).

<p><a id="3" name="3"> The  Mission  continued  to  register  ceasefire  violations  inside  the  Petrivske  disengagement 
area, and, for the first time since 3 October 2019, it registered ceasefire violations inside the 
disengagement area near Stanytsia Luhanska: two on 8 April. Inside the disengagement are-
as near Petrivske and Zolote, SMM long-range unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) spotted peo-

<p><a id="4" name="4"> The  SMM  continued  to  facilitate  and  monitor  adherence  to  localized  ceasefires  to  enable 
repairs to, and construction and maintenance of, critical civilian infrastructure on both sides 
of  the  contact  line.  This  includes  repairs  to  water  infrastructure  in  Zaitseve,  Krasnyi  Lyman 
and Horlivka, and the construction of a power line near Maiorsk. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5"> On 13 April, while monitoring adherence to a localized ceasefire to facilitate the operation of 
the Donetsk Filtration Station, an SMM patrol in Yasynuvata came under fire, with bullets or 
pieces of shrapnel flying overhead and three rounds from undetermined weapons impacting 
nearby (see Spot Report 12/2020). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6"> Members  of  the  armed  formations  continued  to  deny  the  SMM  passage  at  checkpoints 
along official crossing routes in Donetsk and Luhansk regions (see  Spot Report 9/2020, Spot 
Report  10/2020,  Spot  Report  11/2020,  Spot  Report  13/2020  and  Spot  Report  14/2020).  In 
total, the Mission’s freedom of movement on the ground was restricted 50 times (all in areas 
not  controlled  by  the  Government).  SMM  UAVs  were  subjected  to  signal  interference  on 
both  sides  of  the  contact  line  on  26  occasions,  and  were  targeted  by  small-arms  fire  three 
times (once in government- and twice in non-government-controlled areas).
