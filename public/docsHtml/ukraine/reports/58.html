<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  Mission  continued  to  monitor  the  disengagement  areas  near  Stanytsia Luhanska,  Zolote  and  Petrivske,  recording  ceasefire  violations  inside  and  near  the disengagement area near Zolote and Petrivske.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  The SMM corroborated reports of six civilian casualties – four injured and two killed, five of which due to shelling and gunfire and one due to mines, UXOs and other ex-plosive  objects.  This  brings  the  total  number  of  confirmed  civilian  casualties  since the beginning of 2021 to 57 (14 fatalities and 43 injuries). Thirty-six casualties were due to mines, unexploded ordnance and other explosive objects, nine were caused by small-arms fire and 12 were a result of shelling.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The Mission’s freedom of movement was restricted 27 times, including 24 instances in  non-government-controlled  areas.  SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAVs)  were assessed as targeted by small-arms fire five times, four of which in non-government-controlled areas. SMM UAVs experienced signal interference assessed as caused by probable jamming on 46 occasions, while flying on both sides of the contact line.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  The  Mission  continued  to  observe  civilians  while  crossing,  or  attempting  to  cross, the contact  line and the challenges they face. The SMM again noted that the only crossing points civilians were able to use were near Stanytsia Luhanska, open daily, and Novotroitske/Olenivka, open twice a week, as the corresponding checkpoint of the armed formations is open for crossing only on Mondays and Fridays.

<p><a id="5" name="5">  The  SMM  continued  to  facilitate  and  monitor  adherence  to  localized  ceasefires  to enable the maintenance and operation of critical civilian infrastructure. This activity included enabling repairs to the phenol reservoir pipeline near Nelipivka, to a water pipeline near Kamianka, and to power lines in and near Vodiane, near Lebedynske and near NovoLuhanske.
