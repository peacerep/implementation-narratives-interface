<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 8 and 21 January 2018, the OSCE SMM recorded around 13,000 ceasefire violations 

– a 55 per cent increase compared with the previous two-week reporting period.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The majority of ceasefire violations were recorded in areas east and north-east of Mariupol; 
in the western and northern outskirts of Horlivka; in areas south-east and east of Svitlodarsk; 
and  in  the  Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-Donetsk  Airport  area.  The  latter  two  areas  were  the  most 
affected,  with  72  percent  of  all  ceasefire  violations  recorded  there  during  the  reporting 
period.   

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  Armed violence between 8 and 21 January resulted in civilian casualties, leaving three people 

killed and two injured.   

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  Between 8 and 21 January, the Mission facilitated and monitored six ‘windows of silence’  – 
localized adherence to the ceasefire – which allowed for inspection, repair and maintenance 
work  on  three  critical  civilian  infrastructure  facilities  on  both  sides  of  the  contact  line:  one 
near  Shchastia  on  19  January  notably  resulted in  the  restoration  of  all  mobile 
telecommunications  services  across  the  contact  line  and  within  non-government-controlled 
areas of Luhansk region. Disruption to services  – also affecting Donetsk region – had started 
on 11 January. Services remain severed across the contact line in Donetsk region and within 
non-government-controlled areas of the region, where security guarantees have not yet been 
provided to enable repairs to the damaged link in Olenivka.
