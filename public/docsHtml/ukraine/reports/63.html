<p><a id="0" name="0">  The  security  situation  in  eastern  Ukraine  continued  to  be  volatile  and  tense.   Although  the  SMM  recorded  an  increase  in  the  number  of  ceasefire  violations during the week of 9-15 January, the mission observed a decline in violations at all main hotspots the following week. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  vast  majority  of  recorded  ceasefire  violations  occurred  to  the  east  and   south-east  of  Svitlodarsk,  the  Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-Donetsk  airport  area,  to  the north-east  and  east  of  Mariupol,  in  areas  west  and  north  of  Horlivka,  and  in western  Luhansk  region.  Stanytsia  Luhanska,  which  was  previously  relatively quiet, saw a rise in violence in the second week, accounting for five per cent of all recorded ceasefire violations.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  disengagement  process  remained  stalled.  The  SMMâ€™s  access  to  the  three disengagement  areas  continued  to  be  restricted  due  to  mines  and  unexploded ordnance (UXO), though the SMM was able to partially monitor them, including through remote observation. The SMM observed ceasefire violations in or near the three disengagement areas.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  In  his  address  to  the  OSCE  Permanent  Council  on  19  January,  the  SMM  Chief Monitor  Ambassador  Ertugrul  Apakan  warned  that  failure  to  implement  Minsk agreements  meant  that  the  risk  of  further  escalation  remained.
