<p><a id="19" name="19">The  SMM  continued  to  facilitate  and  monitor  adherence  to  localized  ceasefires  to  enable 
construction  and  maintenance  of  critical  civilian  infrastructure.  </a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">Notably,  the  Mission contin-

<p><a id="24" name="24">Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the SMM continued to note limited numbers of civilians cross-
ing the contact line at Stanytsia Luhanska bridge, with many denied entry because of residen-
cy requirements,  the operation of  a list  system or  difficulties in  downloading  a  self-isolation 
tracking application.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">In Donetsk region, where entry-exit checkpoints are mostly open, corre-
sponding checkpoints of the armed formations – except one, which operated only two days a 
week – remained closed, resulting in severely restricted movement and hardship for the civil-
ian population.</a></p>

<p><a id="29" name="29">The  Mission’s  freedom  of movement  was  restricted  17  times  on  the  ground,  all but  one  in 
non-government-controlled  areas.  </a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  experienced  signal  inter-
ference  assessed  as caused  by probable jamming  on 25 occasions while  flying near the  con-
tact line in  government-  and  non-government-controlled  areas,  including  twice over  the dis-
engagement area near Petrivske.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">Combined with the destruction by gunfire of the SMM cam-
era system in Petrivske on 2 June and the presence of mines along the Bohdanivka-Viktorivka
-Petrivske  road,  the  Mission’s  ability  to  effectively  monitor  in  this  disengagement  area  re-
mains severely limited.
