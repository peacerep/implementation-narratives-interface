<p><a id="0" name="0"> The security situation in eastern Ukraine has slowly but steadily deteriorated 
following an initial decrease in the number of ceasefire violations when the 
sides recommitted to the ceasefire in late August. During the week of 9 to 
15 October in the areas between Avdiivka, Yasynuvata and the Donetsk 
airport area and around Horlivka, the levels of armed violence reached the 
daily number of ceasefire violations recorded before the recommitment.

<p><a id="1" name="1"> The SMM also recorded the use of weapons that should have been withdrawn 
under the Minsk agreements – 351 times over the period from 2 to 
15 October. On 10 October, for the first time in two months, the SMM 
recorded the use of multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS).

<p><a id="2" name="2"> From 2 to 15 October, the mission confirmed three civilian casualties, 
including one injured, a sixteen year-old boy. This brings the total number of 
civilian casualties recorded this year to 400.

<p><a id="3" name="3"> SMM monitors, in co-ordination with the Joint Centre for Control and 
Co-ordination, contributed to improving of the humanitarian situation by 
facilitating and monitoring localized adherence to the ceasefire. From 2 to 15 
October, these “windows of silence” allowed for inspection, repair and 
maintenance work to more than ten infrastructure facilities, including 
powerlines, water pipelines, a pumping station, and water wells. On 
12 October the SMM facilitated and monitored demining activities in the area 
around a gas distribution station near Marinka to restore local gas distribution. 
An engineer and a technician were able to enter the station for the first time 
since April 2015. In total, the Mission conducted at least 86 patrols in support 
of repairs and maintenance of essential infrastructure facilities on both sides 
of the contact line.
