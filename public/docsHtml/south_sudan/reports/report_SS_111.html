Executive Summary 

</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">This Report of the Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (RJMEC) on 
the status of implementation of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in 
the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) covers the period from 1st January to 31st March 2019. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">It  highlights  the  prevailing  political,  security,  humanitarian,  and  economic  situation  in  the 
country while paying close attention to the progress being made by the Agreement institutions 
and mechanisms to implement their mandate as envisaged during the Pre-Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">
 
 In addition, it identifies incidents of compliance or lack thereof with the terms of the R-ARCSS. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">At the same time the Report underscores the engagement of the RJMEC leadership with the 
Parties,  regional  guarantors  and  stakeholders  of  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">Finally,  it  offers  some  key 
observations and recommendations for remedial action to ensure effective implementation of 
the Peace Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">The general political and security situation in the Republic of South Sudan continues to offer 
hope for a successful implementation of the R-ARCSS, underpinned by a commendable show 
of commitment and cooperation exhibited by all the Parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">There are also signs of economic 
normalcy returning.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">For the most part, there has been very few reports of fighting or active 
conflict in the country, except for heightened tensions around the Yei River area, and an upsurge 
in incidents of cattle rustling around Wau.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">There has also been reports of Sexual and Gender 
Based Violence (SGBV) in a few areas of the country, which has prompted action on the part 
of the authorities to address the issue.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45"> 

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">Notwithstanding  the  generally  favourable  atmosphere,  CTSAMVM  continues  to  encounter 
denial of access by some of the Parties as it attempts to investigate alleged incidents of violations 
of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">Humanitarian access impediments, although on the decline, also continue to 
occur in a situation where more than three-quarters of the population are reported to be food 
insecure  and  in  need  of  humanitarian  assistance.  </a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">Importantly  the  United  Nations  Security 
Council  (UNSC)  renewed  the  UN  Mission  (UNMISS)  mandate,  which  remain  focused  on 
protecting  civilians,  creating  the  conditions  conducive  to  the  delivery  of  humanitarian 
assistance, monitoring and investigating human rights, and supporting the peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49"> 

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">During the current reporting period the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) 
successfully  established  the  Technical  Boundary  Committee  (TBC)  and  the  Independent 
Boundaries Commission (IBC).</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">The TBC completed its work of listing, describing and mapping 
tribal  boundary  areas  of  1st  January  1956  currently  in  dispute  as  a  consequence  of  the 
establishment of 32 States in South Sudan, and submitted its report to the IGAD mediation.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">

 

 </a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">In the same period, the IBC began working on its mandate to consider the number of States of 
the Republic of South Sudan, their boundaries, the composition and restructuring of the Council 
of States and to make recommendations on the same.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">With the establishment of the IBC only 
one, the Disarmament Demobilization and  Reintegration (DDR) Commission remains to be 
reconstituted under the terms of the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">Regarding  progress  in  implementing  the  prescribed  pre-transitional  tasks  by  the  various 
Agreement institutions and implementation mechanisms, the RJMEC made very good progress 
in the dissemination of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">It reprinted sixteen thousand copies of the R-ARCSS, 
and produced seventeen thousand six hundred copies of the summarized version, which have 

 

  
 iii 

also been translated into some local languages, and Arabic, and these have been recorded for 
broadcast as public service announcements.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">The National Pre-Transitional Committee (NPTC) has played a critical role in coordinating 
implementation of the activities of the Pre-Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">It’s leadership and support were 
instrumental in the activities of most agreement institutions and mechanisms and in facilitating 
the return of opposition representatives to Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">The NPTC developed a budget and solicited 
financial  and  other  resources  from  the  incumbent  TGoNU  and  partners,  which  has  enabled 
implementation of key activities.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">The security mechanisms after a delayed start have begun implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">In particular, the 
Joint Defence Board (JDB) after a series of confidence building measures in potential hotspots 
have  put  in  place  plans,  together  with  the  Joint  Military  Ceasefire  Committee  (JMCC),  for 
cantonment and the unification of forces. 

 

 </a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">Phase  One  of  the  process  entails  twenty-five  (25)  sites  dedicated  to  the  Sudan  Peoples' 
Liberation Army - In Opposition (SPLA-IO) and the South Sudan Opposition Alliance (SSOA), 
and ten (10) major barracks assigned for the South Sudanese Peoples’ Defence Forces (SSPDF). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Each of the 25 sites is planned to hold a maximum of 3,750 troops.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">SPLA-IO and SSOA troops 
are reportedly moving to locations closer to the proposed cantonment sites.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">The JDB has also 
developed a plan to identify and train a force of three thousand (3,000) South Sudan National 
Police Forces to assume the role of internal security of Juba. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">The RJMEC leadership continues to support the IGAD Special Envoy for South Sudan in the 
quest to engage non-signatories to join in implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">RJMEC seconded 
advisors to develop a strategy for engagement of non-signatories and the RJMEC leadership 
accompanied the Special Envoy in talks with General Thomas Cirillo on two separate occasions 
in Addis Ababa and once with General Paul Malong in Nairobi. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">This in efforts to ensure the uninterrupted and smooth implementation of the peace process. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">Other engagements included meeting with the leadership of the NPTC and the other Agreement 
institutions and mechanisms, holding discussions with the State Minister of Foreign Affairs of 
Ethiopia, the diplomatic community, and the leadership of the Parties to the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73"> 

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">Overall, the R-ARCSS provides the best available opportunity to ending the cycle of violence 
in South Sudan and building lasting peace.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">RJMEC is encouraged with the political will and 
commitment  being  demonstrated  by  the  leadership  of  the  Parties  to  the  peace  agreement. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">Admittedly, there has been a slow start and some critical timelines have been missed, but all 
indications are that the Parties, with support from the partners, will be positioned to expedite 
and implement all pending and requisite tasks.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">These may all not be possible within the prescribed Pre-Transitional Period but what is critical 
is to lay a firm foundation upon which the Revitalised Transitional Government of National 
Unity (R-TGoNU) can be formed to take forward implementation of the peace agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">In light of the above the RJMEC encourages the Parties to proactively engage one another and 
together agree on the best way forward to expedite formation of the unity government;</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">explore 
and avail additional resources to the NPTC and all agreement mechanisms;</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81"> </a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">and adopt a unified 

 

  
 iv 

and coordinated awareness campaign to send a strong message of unity of purpose to the people 
of South Sudan.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">Also, the JDB should expedite the cantonment, training and deployment of unified forces;</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">and   
the Parties should immediately reconstitute the DDR Commission, a key mechanism for dealing 
with former combatants who do not qualify to join the unified forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">Lastly, the RJMEC renews 
its call to the Parties to adhere to their obligations to refrain from acts and forms of SGBV and 
ensure protection and safety of women in areas under their control.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">Finally, IGAD should expedite and conclude its engagements with the non-signatories before 
the  end  of  the  Pre-Transitional  Period  and  prior  to  the  formation  of  the  unity  government. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">RJMEC further recommends that IGAD convene a meeting of the Council of Ministers and a 
Summit to take stock of the status of implementation of the pre transitional tasks and make a 
determination on the way forward.

<p><a id="90" name="90">This Report is submitted pursuant to Chapter VII, Article 7.9 of the Revitalised Agreement on 

I. Introduction 

the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) and covers the 
period 1st January to 31st March 2019.  </a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">The end of the first quarter of 2019 marks more than 
six months of Pre-Transitional activities and less than two months before the start of the 
Transitional Period, as indicated in the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">2.  </a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">Overall, relatively good progress has been made in accomplishing the Pre-Transitional tasks. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">However,  two  critical  activities  anticipated  to  have  been  completed  by  the  end  of  the  Pre-
Transitional Period only started during this quarter.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">This relates to the cantonment and training 
of a unified army and the tasks of the Independent Boundaries Commission (IBC), linked to 
considering the number of states of South Sudan, their boundaries, and the restructuring of the 
Council of States.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">The Disarmament Demobilization and Reintegration  (DDR) Commission 
remains the only implementation mechanism yet to be reconstituted.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">3.  </a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">Notwithstanding the delay in getting the IBC established the Technical Boundary Committee 
(TBC) has completed its work and presented its Report to the Intergovernmental Authority on 
Development (IGAD) Mediation.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">The TBC was charged with defining and demarcating the 
tribal areas of South Sudan as they stood on 1st January 1956, and the tribal boundaries that 
were violated by the 32 states.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">Their report will inform the IBC in making its recommendations 
on the number and boundaries of states.  
 

4.  </a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">The political and security situation remains relatively stable with most of the country considered 
to be calm.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">However, tensions remain in the Yei River area where fighting previously took place 
between forces allied to General Thomas Cirillo of the National Salvation Front (NAS) and 
those  of  the  South  Sudanese  Peoples’  Defence  Forces  (SSPDF)  and  the  Sudan  Peoples' 
Liberation Army - In Opposition (SPLA-IO).  </a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">The NAS faction led by Gen. Thomas Cirillo has 
rejected  the  R-ARCSS  and  considers  itself  not  bound  by  the  Permanent  Ceasefire  and 
Transitional Security Arrangements being implemented by the Agreement Parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">There has 
also been an upsurge in incidents of cattle rustling, particularly in the area East of Wau, often 
resulting in violence.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">Confidence building efforts between the various parties to the Agreement 
have continued apace, and the work of the institutions and implementation mechanisms, for the 
most part has been progressing well.  

 

5.  </a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">During the period under review the IGAD Special Envoy for South Sudan Ambassador Ismail 
Wais  with  the  support  of  the  Reconstituted  Joint  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Commission 
(RJMEC) leadership launched a diplomatic effort to reach out to the non-signatories to the R-
ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">To date talks with General Thomas Cirillo have not yielded much result while those 
with General Paul Malong have generally been more encouraging.  

 

6.  </a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">The  RJMEC  has  embarked  on  a  rigorous  dissemination  exercise  as  it  seeks  to  distribute 
information on the Agreement to as wide a segment of the population as possible.</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">This include 

translating a summary of the peace agreement into Juba Arabic, Dinka and Nuer, which have 
also  been  recorded  and  broadcast  as  public  service  announcements  and  making  available 
English copies of the Agreement across South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">In addition, efforts necessary to produce 
the summary in Bari, Zande and Shilluk have also been taken, and will be completed shortly. 

 

7.  </a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">Section II of the Report highlights the prevailing political, security, humanitarian and economic 
situation in the Republic of South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">At the same time Section III reports on the progress 
made  in  implementing  various  activities  by  the  Agreement  institutions  and  implementation 
mechanisms, during the reporting period.</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">This is augmented by a detailed list and update of the 
activities pursued since the signing of the R-ARCSS, in Annex A.

<p><a id="116" name="116">The Report also highlights some key activities of the RJMEC Secretariat in Section IV.</a></p>

Overview 
 

9.  </a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">In general, the political situation in South Sudan during the reporting period has been calm and 
stable.</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">Many key opposition members who have been in Juba since December report continued 
favourable political conditions conducive to carry out their work within the various Agreement 
institutions  and  implementation  mechanisms.1  That  notwithstanding,  the  internal  leadership 
wrangles observed during the last quarter within the South Sudan Opposition Alliance (SSOA) 
and the Other Political Parties (OPP) remain unresolved and pose a threat to their cohesiveness 
within the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">2  
 

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">With regards to security, for the most part, there has been very few reports of fighting or active 
conflict in the country, except for heightened tensions around the Yei River area, and an upsurge 
in incidents of cattle rustling around Wau.</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">In addition, there have been disturbing incidents of 
Sexual Gender Based Violence (SGBV) in some areas of the country (See Box 1).</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126"> 

 

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">On several occasions the Ceasefire and Transitional Security  Arrangements and Monitoring 
Verification Mechanism (CTSAMVM) was denied access by some of the Parties as it sought to 
investigate alleged reports of violations of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">Humanitarian access impediments, 
although on the decline, also continue to occur in a situation where more than three-quarters of 
the population are reported to be food insecure and in need of humanitarian assistance.</a></p>
<p><a id="129" name="129">

                                                           
</a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">1 For a while this situation was threatened by the non-payment of hotel bills for the opposition members, as 
NPTC struggled to secure financial resources.</a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">However, this has been regularised and the bills cleared thus 
allowing the members to remain in Juba. 
 
2</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">The SSOA is the third largest of the five Parties and signatories to the R-ARCSS while the OPP is the fourth. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">SSOA is comprised of eight opposition political parties and the OPP is made up of six.

Box 1:</a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">Reports of Sexual and Gender Based Violence  

Despite an apparent reduction in reported cases, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) remains a 
serious concern and needs to be addressed.</a></p>
<p><a id="136" name="136">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="137" name="137">In its report on SGBV cases in the Bentiu area, released in March, CTSAMVM confirmed that there had been 
widespread incidents going as far back as early 2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="138" name="138">For instance, in November 2018, CTSAMVM received 
allegations from the UNMISS Human Rights Department and other Humanitarian partners of SGBV incidents 
which were reported to have occurred in what is known as Northern Liech State between 19 and 29 November

<p><a id="179" name="179">In addition, data from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)

level at end-2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="180" name="180">A recent report from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees

<p><a id="201" name="201">Oil fields in Unity that had been closed 
during the fighting are now being reopened, which boosted total production by 33,000 barrels

<p><a id="203" name="203">There was a jump in the overall prices in January reflecting to a large 
extent the extreme price hikes on a few food commodities (especially bread and cereals) in parts

<p><a id="211" name="211">However, the budget estimates were not 
based  on  realistic  assumptions  on  the  repayment  of  advances  for  future  oil  deliveries. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="212" name="212">Consequently, the cash flow available to finance the budget proved to be significantly lower 
than budgeted.

<p><a id="213" name="213">On the financing side of the budget the National Revenue Authority has reported significant 
improvements in non-oil revenue collection through the first 8 months of FY2018/19.  </a></p>
<p><a id="214" name="214">However,

revenues will remain the dominant source of income for the Government in many years to come. 

 

27.</a></p>
<p><a id="216" name="216">In that regard, the development of the oil price and production will be the main determinants of 
the resources that the government can allocate to implement the Peace Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="217" name="217">For instance, 
a sustained increase in the oil price of US $10 may increase annual revenues by more than US 
$ 250M at present production levels;</a></p>
<p><a id="218" name="218">and a sustained increase in production of 10 000 barrels 
per day will increase net oil revenues by around  US$  60M. Since 2015, part of the net oil 
revenues has been allocated to pay transfer payments arrears to Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="219" name="219">These arrears have now 
been cleared, and the cash flow from oil available for financing the budget will increase in the 
coming budget years.

The Technical Boundary Committee (TBC) 

39.</a></p>
<p><a id="278" name="278">The TBC was officially established on 9th January 2019 in Juba by the IGAD Special Envoy for 
South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="279" name="279">The TBC’s mandate as provided for in Article 1.15.18 of the R-ARCSS was to 
“define and demarcate the tribal areas of South Sudan as they stood on 1st January 1956, and 
the tribal areas in dispute in the country”.</a></p>
<p><a id="280" name="280">When this article is read together with Annex E 
(p.122), the TBC’s mandate specifically involved drawing “a list of tribal boundaries in dispute 
as a consequence of introducing the 32 states” in the Republic of South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="281" name="281">
  

40.</a></p>
<p><a id="282" name="282">Accordingly, the TBC’s work was restricted to addressing the tribal boundaries violated as a 
consequence of the establishment of the 32 States (See Box 2).</a></p>
<p><a id="283" name="283">In effect, the TBC was not 
required to list or map tribal boundaries not affected by the establishment of the 32 States (see 
par.1 of Annex E).</a></p>
<p><a id="284" name="284">At the time of its establishment the TBC consisted of eight (8) members, one 
of whom was a woman10  – six from IGAD member states (Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti, Somalia, 
Sudan and Uganda) and two jointly nominated by the Troika countries (See Annex B).</a></p>

Box 2:</a></p>
<p><a id="287" name="287">Summary of the Key Points on the TBC Report 

The  Technical  Boundary  Committee  (TBC),  through  its  three  Sub-committees,  simultaneously  collected, 
collated, analysed and triangulated the requisite data from various sources, and prepared a detailed mission 
report as per its mandate of listing, describing and mapping tribal boundary areas of 1 January 1956 currently 
in disputes as a consequence of establishment of 32 States in the Republic of South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="288" name="288">The Report was 
submitted to the IGAD Mediation, in line with article 1.15.18.5 of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="289" name="289">Attached to the report are 
maps produced by the TBC depicting 32 States as described in the Establishment Orders No.</a></p>
<p><a id="290" name="290">36/2015 and 
2/2017 for the creation of 28 States and 32 States respectively and maps depicting approximate tribal areas in 
dispute as per the mandate of the TBC. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="291" name="291">The TBC could not undertake the ‘demarcation’ component of its mandate.</a></p>
<p><a id="292" name="292">This is due to the fact that the 
actual task of internal boundaries demarcation is not an easy one;</a></p>
<p><a id="293" name="293">it is labour intensive and a time-consuming 
exercise, requiring adequate financial and requisite expertise to be at the disposal of those to engage in the 
process.</a></p>
<p><a id="294" name="294">A specific recommendation was offered on how the government of South Sudan can undertake such 
a huge task in the future.</a></p>
<p><a id="295" name="295">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="296" name="296">Upon completion of its task, the TBC briefed the IGAD Special Envoy for South Sudan on the main findings. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="297" name="297">It also briefed the Independent Boundaries Commission on the same.</a></p>
<p><a id="298" name="298">A common thread of view among the 
majority of the South Sudanese stakeholders consulted is the assertation that they are able and willing to 
resolve the internal ethnic boundary disputes amongst themselves should they be facilitated to do so by a 
neutral body.</a></p>
<p><a id="299" name="299">This also resonates with one of the findings of the South Sudan National Dialogue Committee 
in 2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="300" name="300">This means the resolution of the internal boundary disputes between and/within ethnic communities 
is not a technical issue, but political. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="301" name="301">Throughout its work, the TBC was ably supported by the RJMEC Secretariat through a dedicated Advisor 
who was the Head of the Secretariat.</a></p>
<p><a id="302" name="302">With support from the IGAD communication expert, the Head of TBC 
Secretariat has digitalized all the submissions of the South Sudanese stakeholders to the TBC for ease of 
future reference.   
 
                                                           
   
</a></p>
<p><a id="303" name="303">10 The TBC established its leadership structure as follows:</a></p>

such as Yei, Wau, and parts of Jonglei.</a></p>
<p><a id="344" name="344">The three Chiefs of Defence Staff, that is SSPDF, SPLA-
IO,  and  SSOA  conducted  joint  visits  during  which  they  disseminated  Chapter  II  of  the 
Agreement that covers security matters and resolved some problems on the ground.</a></p>
<p><a id="345" name="345">In addition, 
they  issued  orders  to  field  commanders  to  disengage  and  redeploy  forces  to  barracks  and 
cantonments as well as allow CTSAMVM to verify forces in these locations.  
 

46.</a></p>
<p><a id="346" name="346">These actions by the JDB contributed to the reduction in armed combat among the various

<p><a id="423" name="423">In January the RJMEC leadership continued with its round of consultations with the leadership 
of the various Agreement institutions and implementation mechanisms.</a></p>
<p><a id="424" name="424">This time it met with 
Madam Angelina Teny, Hon Gen. Malek Rueben Riak and Denay Jock Chagor the Chairperson 
and  Co-Chairs  respectively  of  the  SDSRB.  </a></p>
<p><a id="425" name="425">Discussions  revolved  around:</a></p>
<p><a id="426" name="426"> </a></p>
<p><a id="427" name="427">(i)  the  challenges 
faced by the SDSRB;</a></p>

<p><a id="429" name="429">and (iii) a request to the RJMEC 
for assistance to their Secretariat. 
 

62.</a></p>
<p><a id="430" name="430">The  SDSRB  Chairperson  pointed  to  the  lack  of  funding  for  the  cantonment  of  forces  and 
government’s limited resources as a key challenge to accomplishing the goal of having one 
unified army at the end of the Pre-Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="431" name="431">The security concerns of the opposition 
returning to Juba were also noted and RJMEC was assured that everything possible was being 
done by the government to allay their fears.  </a></p>
<p><a id="432" name="432">A decision was also taken to return to opposition 
members homes that were previously seized by the security forces following the events of July 
2016. 
 

63.</a></p>
<p><a id="433" name="433">The RJMEC  leadership  met with that of the Parties to the Agreement14 to discuss an issue 
relating to the governance structure that would obtain during the Pre-Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="434" name="434">It was 
decided that the proper description of the system of government envisaged by the R-ARCSS for 
the Pre-Transitional and Transitional periods remain a decentralized system of government as 
provided for under Article 1 (4) of the TCRSS 2011 (as amended).</a></p>
<p><a id="435" name="435">Furthermore, the R-ARCSS 
explicitly mandates the revitalized TGoNU to devolve more powers and resources to the States 
and lower levels of government.  
 

64.</a></p>
<p><a id="436" name="436">As  part  of  its  continuing  efforts  to  reconcile  various  factions  of  the  SSOA,  the  RJMEC 
leadership met with Gabriel Changson its current Chairman.</a></p>
<p><a id="437" name="437">SSOA has been caught up in a 
dispute  over  the  naming  of  a  Chairman  for  the  organization.  </a></p>
<p><a id="438" name="438">The  party  attempted  to  hold 
elections in November 2018, but these were interrupted and since then the party has been split 
between groups loyal to Changson and those loyal to Peter Gadette.</a></p>
<p><a id="439" name="439">After meeting with leaders 
of three of the eight parties the RJMEC leadership referred the matter to Ambassador Wais for 
further mediation.</a></p>
<p><a id="440" name="440"> 

 

65.</a></p>
<p><a id="441" name="441">In a similar manner the RJMEC leadership held discussions with the Chairmen of the six parties 
that constitute the OPP, one of the five Parties to the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="442" name="442">There continues to be major 
disagreement and lack of cohesiveness of the parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="443" name="443">Discussions centered around the need for 
the OPP to remain united in the face of competing pressures within their organizations.</a></p>
<p><a id="444" name="444">It was 
made very clear to the OPP representatives that going forward the IGAD and RJMEC would 
only recognize the OPP as a group and not the individual parties constituting the OPP.</a></p>
<p><a id="445" name="445">In that 
regard it was important to get consensus on a focal point for the parties.</a></p>

<p><a id="448" name="448">In  early  February  the  RJMEC  leadership  conducted  a  series  of  consultations  with  several 
members of the diplomatic corps in Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="449" name="449">The meetings were requested by the RJMEC Interim 
Chairman to get their views on the progress of implementation of the Peace Agreement and 
feedback on various issues of concern to the leadership15.</a></p>
<p><a id="450" name="450">On the question of progress, it was 
agreed that it was not too early to think about the start of the Transitional Period and how this 
may be impacted by current events.</a></p>
<p><a id="451" name="451">Should consideration for example be given on how to stretch 
or adjust the start without breaking the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="452" name="452">

67.</a></p>
<p><a id="453" name="453">Serious concern was expressed about possible military action against Cirillo and how this could 
impact the Peace implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="454" name="454">There appears to be a willingness to provide resources to the 
implementation  process,  if  there  is  a  clear  commitment  from  TGoNU  and  a  roadmap  to 
implementation as well as transparency, particularly with the handling of available oil revenues. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="455" name="455">Finally, support was expressed for the work of the RJMEC and its continued role in monitoring 
and evaluating the Peace Agreement.</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="457" name="457">68.</a></p>
<p><a id="458" name="458">The RJMEC leadership consulted with the Chairman of CTSAMVM on issues ranging from the 
current situation in the Yei River area to the holding of technical committee meetings in Juba,

investigation of the rapes in Bentiu and the Luri incident.</a></p>

<p><a id="460" name="460">As  part  of  its  ongoing  efforts  to  more  actively  engage  the  public  on  issues  surrounding 
implementation of the Peace Agreement, the RJMEC issued three press releases16 focused on a 
condemnation of the military build-up in Yei River, the need for soldiers to be disciplined and 
not interfere with politics, and an upbeat analysis of the overall security situation.</a></p>
<p><a id="461" name="461">

<p><a id="462" name="462">Discussions took place between the State Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Democratic

<p><a id="473" name="473">Prior to the meetings the Special Envoy laid out several principles to guide the discussions:</a></p>
<p><a id="474" name="474">(i) 
there will be no re-negotiation or reopening of the R-ARCSS;</a></p>
<p><a id="475" name="475">(ii) IGAD recognizes the old 
groups/parties as at the HLRF;</a></p>
<p><a id="476" name="476">(iii) the R-ARCSS and its PCTSA has subsumed the CoHA 
2017, and therefore no party can claim adherence to CoHA without being bound by the R-
ARCSS;</a></p>
<p><a id="477" name="477">(iv) a non-signatory to the R-ARCSS cannot claim adherence or protection by CoHA, 
in  as  far  as  the  actions  are  inconsistent  with  the  PCTSA  under  R-ARCSS;</a></p>
<p><a id="478" name="478"> </a></p>
<p><a id="479" name="479">(v)  any  group 
unwilling  to  join  R-ARCSS  and  whose  activities  impede  its  full  implementation  shall  be 
considered as a spoiler and held accountable;</a></p>
<p><a id="480" name="480">and (vi) any activity attributable to forces allied 
to a non-signatory group shall be deemed duly authorized by the leadership of that group.</a></p>
<p><a id="481" name="481">

72.</a></p>
<p><a id="482" name="482">Following the first meeting in Addis it was agreed that General Cirillo would give a formal 
written response to the proposals on 14th March at the other scheduled meeting with the team in 
Addis.</a></p>
<p><a id="483" name="483">General Cirillo did not show up to the meeting but instead sent his proposals to the team. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="484" name="484">No further action has to date been undertaken by the IGAD Special Envoy. 18 

73.</a></p>
<p><a id="485" name="485">The RJMEC Leadership met with a visiting delegation of the African Union Peace and Security 
Council headed by Ambassador Catherine Muigai Mwangi.  </a></p>
<p><a id="486" name="486">Issues discussed ranged from a 
closer involvement of the AU in liaising with the international community in support of the 
peace  agreement;</a></p>
<p><a id="487" name="487"> </a></p>
<p><a id="488" name="488">and  AU  countries  stepping  up  their  financial  and  other  support  for  the

<p><a id="489" name="489">

74.</a></p>
<p><a id="490" name="490">Discussions were also held with a visiting  IMF delegation and revolved around the lack of 
transparency in the reporting and recording of oil revenues and its negative impact on the donor 
community and their willingness to provide funding to implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="491" name="491">It was agreed that the 
authorities must do more to inspire confidence in their management of this critical resource. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="492" name="492">Other aspects of the discussion focused on the dire state of the economy, political developments 
around implementation, and the potential timing of the return of the IMF to South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="493" name="493">On 
the latter the delegation informed RJMEC that they are still in a wait and see posture before 
committing to a full return.</a></p>

<p><a id="496" name="496">In accordance with the implementation matrix of the R-ARCSS some of the key tasks completed 
to date are:</a></p>

<p><a id="498" name="498">i) the establishment or reconstituting of all except one of the Agreement institutions

<p><a id="510" name="510">(</a></p>
<p><a id="511" name="511">1) re-opening of R-ARCSS for inclusive discussion and conclusion in a 
conducive secure environment accessible to all;</a></p>
<p><a id="512" name="512">(2) coercing of the Non-Signatories to sign R-ARCSS and 
labelling them as ‘’Spoilers’’ would not achieve the desired result for a comprehensive agreement in the 
Republic South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="513" name="513">(3) the office of the IGAD Special Envoy to South Sudan should adhere to its Terms of 
Reference (TOR) as directed by the IGAD Council of Ministers at its 66th Extraordinary Session in Addis 
Ababa, to engage with all the parties who didn’t sign the R-ARCSS, 2018 rather than being selective in its 
engagements.

</a></p>
<p><a id="515" name="515">76.</a></p>
<p><a id="516" name="516">The main tasks that are ongoing during the Pre-Transitional Period include dissemination of the 
R-ARCSS,  the  work  of  the  IBC,  delivery  of  humanitarian  assistance,  release  of  political 
prisoners and detainees, and disengagement of forces, and the beginning of a process of national 
healing and reconciliation. 
 

77.</a></p>
<p><a id="517" name="517">However, some Pre-Transitional tasks are pending including:</a></p>
<p><a id="518" name="518">(i) cantonment and training of

<p><a id="519" name="519">(iii) security issues related to new

78.</a></p>
<p><a id="522" name="522">After a prolonged delay the JDB has started the proceess of cantonment and training of forces. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="523" name="523">RJMEC stresses the critical importance of this engagement in determining the way forward. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="524" name="524">The unification of forces, which involves the process of cantonment and training, should be 
expedited by all parties involved.</a></p>
<p><a id="525" name="525">In particular, the forces of  SSOA and SPLM-A/IO should 
report to the cantonment sites and the SSPDF to the assigned barracks.</a></p>
<p><a id="526" name="526">At the same time the 
NPTC  should  make  available  the  required  resources,  while  CTSAMVM  undertakes  the 
necessary verification.</a></p>

<p><a id="528" name="528">RJMEC applauds the establishment of both the TBC and IBC, and welcomes the final report of 
the TBC, which will inform the work of the IBC.</a></p>
<p><a id="529" name="529">RJMEC therefore urges the IBC to expedite 
their work during the available time period.   
 

80.</a></p>
<p><a id="530" name="530">Despite an apparent reduction in reported cases, sexual and gender-based violence remains a 
serious concern and needs to be urgently addressed.</a></p>
<p><a id="531" name="531">RJMEC renews its call to the Parties to 
adhere to their obligations to refrain from all acts and forms of SGBV and ensure protection and 
safety of women in areas under their control.</a></p>
<p><a id="532" name="532">It also recommends that the fight against SGBV 
be made a priority.</a></p>
<p><a id="533" name="533">RJMEC also welcomes the launching of the SSPDF’s Action Plan to counter 
SGBV and encourages other parties to do the same. 

 

81.</a></p>
<p><a id="534" name="534">RJMEC recommends the promotion and dissemination of the Peace Agreement to be  sustained 
into the future.</a></p>
<p><a id="535" name="535">In particular, political leaders need to adopt a unified and coordinated awareness 
campaign to send a strong message of unity to the people of South Sudan and to demonstrate 
their continued commitment to the implementation of the R-ARCSS in letter and spirit.  
 

82.</a></p>
<p><a id="536" name="536">RJMEC welcomes the UNSC Resolution 2459, which accepted IGAD’s recommendation to 
expand  the  troop  contributing  countries  to  include  Djibouti,  Kenya,  Somalia,  Sudan  and 
Uganda, in order to fill the deficit in the RPF.</a></p>
<p><a id="537" name="537">RJMEC therefore urges the said troop contributing

<p><a id="539" name="539">The tensions reported in the Yei River area and the continued rise in cattle rustling incidents 
pose a serious threat to the stability of that region, notwithstanding the relative peace that is 
evident across most of the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="540" name="540">The RJMEC commends the efforts of the IGAD Special 
Envoy in engaging General Cirillo to re-join the peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="541" name="541">In the same vein RJMEC calls 
on the international partners to assist in these efforts.</a></p>

<p><a id="544" name="544">Chapter IV of the R-ARCSS recommend policies geared at economic stability and sustainability 
of government finances.</a></p>
<p><a id="545" name="545">This will require that some of the petroleum revenues are set aside to 
preserve economic stability and for long-term investments.</a></p>
<p><a id="546" name="546">Consequently, a medium-term fiscal 
framework incorporating policy targets, including R-ARCSS commitments will constitute the 
best starting point for discussions with international partners. 

 

85.</a></p>
<p><a id="547" name="547">Further, the I-TGoNU and its successor RTGoNU have to ensure that appropriate institutions, 
mechanisms and systems are in place to bring about accountability and  transparency in the 
management of oil and non-oil revenues.</a></p>
<p><a id="548" name="548">RJMEC believes that this is vital to promote trust and 
confidence between the government of South Sudan its people and the development partners. 

 

86.</a></p>
<p><a id="549" name="549">At this important stage of the Pre-Transitional Period, the RJMEC urges the leadership of all 
the Parties to the Agreement to meet urgently in order to review progress in the implementation 
of the RARCSS, and come up with a roadmap on the way forward.  

 

87.</a></p>
<p><a id="550" name="550">Finally, RJMEC recommends that IGAD convene a meeting of the Council of Ministers and a 
Summit to take stock of the status of implementation of the pre transitional tasks and make a 
determination on the way forward.</a></p>

<p><a id="552" name="552">Conclusion 

88.</a></p>
<p><a id="553" name="553">With less than two months to go to the end of the Pre-Transitional Period stipulated in the R-
ARCSS attention is rightly focused on the work of the IBC and the JDB’s attempt to canton and 
train forces i.e. to determine the number of states and set up unified forces respectively.</a></p>
<p><a id="554" name="554">While 
both activities started later than anticipated they remain important considerations that need to 
be taken into account as the Parties deliberate on the way forward. 
 

89.</a></p>
<p><a id="555" name="555">In RJMEC’s considered opinion, commendable progress has already been in the last months of 
the Pre-Transitional Period and the Parties appear determined to make even better progress in 
the weeks and months ahead, which is very encouraging.  </a></p>
<p><a id="556" name="556">The renewed efforts and momentum 
will be accelerated by the availability of financial resources, if made available by the NPTC. 

 

90.</a></p>
<p><a id="557" name="557">Unlike in the past, there is demonstrable political will among the Parties to implement the R-
ARCSS and for this, the parties must be commended and encouraged.</a></p>
<p><a id="558" name="558">This bodes well for a 
favourable outcome and for the delivery of lasting peace to South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="559" name="559"> 

 

 

  
 18 

91.</a></p>
<p><a id="560" name="560">Lastly, the current progress can be further bolstered by the authorities granting complete access 
to the humanitarian organizations and allowing unfettered access to CTSAMVM to conduct its 
activities  and  with  the  support  of  the  regional  partners  and  the  international  community 
extending  financial  and  other  support-moral  and  political.  </a></p>
<p><a id="561" name="561">The  steps  already  taken,  and 
commitment expressed by the Parties to address the prevalence of SGBV is also worthy of note 
even  though  much  remains  to  be  done.  </a></p>
<p><a id="562" name="562">Undoubtedly  success  in  those  areas  will  lay  the 
groundwork for the heightened pace of return for the internally displaced and the refugees and 
help set the stage for an improved economy and a better future for the people of South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="563" name="563">

 

92.</a></p>
<p><a id="564" name="564">RJMEC on its part shall continue to impartially monitor, evaluate and report as it vigorously 
carries out its oversight responsibilities with regards to the R-ARCSS, and make interventions 
when necessary.</a></p>
<p><a id="565" name="565">It will also continue regular reporting in writing to the incumbent TGoNU, the

<p><a id="886" name="886">Note:</a></p>
<p><a id="887" name="887">From the Implementation Matrix as provided by the R-ARCSS, a series of important tasks were required 
to be implemented during the eight (8) months Pre-Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="888" name="888">The above table summarises fifty-
seven (57) key activities which were to be implemented.</a></p>
<p><a id="889" name="889"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="890" name="890">The above tasks were categorised into three broad categories and assessed to determine their current status 
of implementation i.e. completed, pending or ongoing.  

▪  Completed tasks are one-time action required to produce results.</a></p>
<p><a id="891" name="891"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="892" name="892">▪  Pending tasks denotes where no action has been taken and no result is available.  
▪  Ongoing denotes some process have begun or partially undertaken but further actions are required 

in order to deliver the expected results or ensure full compliance.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="893" name="893">Observations  

From the above table, 27 out of 59 tasks have been completed.</a></p>
<p><a id="894" name="894">This represents approximately 44% of the 
overall tasks.</a></p>
<p><a id="895" name="895">Fifteen (17) out of 57 have started but still ongoing with different levels and timelines to 
expected completion.</a></p>
<p><a id="896" name="896">This accounts for approximately 26%.</a></p>
<p><a id="897" name="897">Seventeen (15) out of 57 tasks are yet to begin 
or be undertaken representing 30% of the required tasks.</a></p>
<p><a id="898" name="898">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="899" name="899">However, the few unimplemented tasks are very critical for the formation of the RTGoNU and effective 
implementation of the R-ARCSS going forward.</a></p>
<p><a id="900" name="900">The completed tasks relate largely to the establishment or 
reconstitution of institutions and mechanisms of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="901" name="901">Even though these have been established 
or reconstituted accordingly, their functionality has been a big challenge.</a></p>

 </a></p>
<p><a id="903" name="903">26 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

Most of the institutions and mechanisms have not been able to implement their assigned tasks effectively 
due to resource constraints and other impediments.</a></p>
<p><a id="904" name="904">These gaps have serious ramifications for the transition 
from Pre-Transitional Period into the Transitional Period.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="905" name="905">Some of the tasks, including the unification of forces and determination of number of States and boundaries 
issues by IBC are critical for the formation of the RTGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="906" name="906">Lack of coordination and evidence of close 
cooperation  amongst  the  key  principles  at  the  highest  level  continue  to  cast  doubts  and  undermine 
confidence in the peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="907" name="907">

</a></p>
<p><a id="908" name="908">There has been inadequate support from partners to the NPTC which partly accounts for the lagging behind. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="909" name="909">The Pre-Transitional Period tasks were expected to be funded by the incumbent TGoNU with support of 
international  partners.  </a></p>
<p><a id="910" name="910">Even  though  some  support  has  been  provided,  the  partners’  contribution  has 
generally not been forth coming.</a></p>
<p><a id="911" name="911">There is need to match words with action if the R-ARCSS is to be fully 
implemented.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="912" name="912">Conclusion  
Therefore, even though the Transitional Period is expected to commence immediately at the end of the 
eight (8) months after the signing of this Agreement (Art.</a></p>
<p><a id="913" name="913">1.1.2;</a></p>
<p><a id="914" name="914">Art.2.2.1 and Art.</a></p>
<p><a id="915" name="915">2.3.1 of the R-ARCSS), 
the decision to be taken in the next couple of weeks as we near the end of the Pre-Transitional Period is to 
determine to what extent, these critical pending tasks can be expedited to enable timely formation of the 
RTGoNU, at all levels, and whether or not the tasks can be done concurrently into the Transitional Period 
by the RTGoNU without jeopardising full implementation of the peace agreement.</a></p>
