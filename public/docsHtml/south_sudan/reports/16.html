CTSAMM REPORT NUMBER 039
KILLING OF CIVILIANS IN WAU
Executive Summary
Due to unresolved inter-ethnic issues which pre-date the current conflict the situation in
and around Wau has been unpredictable and tense for several years, and within the
last 12 months there have been ongoing clashes between Government and opposition
forces.
</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">On  April 2017 Government Forces mounted offensive operations against SPLM/A-IO
forces to the south and south-west of Wau.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">The following day during ongoing operations
two senior Government Forces officers and several soldiers were killed in an ambush,
allegedly by the SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">One of the officers was brother to the governor in Rumbek.
</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">On  April groups of armed men, some in uniform and some in civilian clothes, shot
and killed at least 29 and wounded at least  civilians in several areas of Wau town.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">Those targeted were from local ethnic groups, specifically those who did not speak the
Dinka language.
</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">It is the opinion of JTC that Government Forces were in blatant violation of the PCTSA
by failing to protect civilians in Wau on  April.

<p><a id="15" name="15">KILLING OF CIVILIANS IN WAU
1.0  Introduction
1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">There have long been tensions in the area to the south-west of Wau and in
Wau itself involving various ‘Fertit’ ethnic groups opposed to what they
perceive as a takeover of their traditional areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">These tensions led to
violence a year before the start of the current conflict, and subsequent to
December 2013 localised opposition to the government became associated
with the SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">Clashes between SPLM/A-IO and Government Forces
developed in early 2016 and CTSAMM recorded a violation  against
Government Forces in March 2016.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">June 2016 saw tensions in Wau break out into violent clashes between
Government Forces and local armed youths, and since then there have been
regular incidents and clashes:</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">Government Forces  reportedly mounted
offensive operations to the south and south-west of Wau in December 2016,
and reports were received in January of clashes between local people and
armed cattle keepers from Warrap and Lakes States as well as alleged
attacks by opposition groups against both military and civilian targets.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">There
were several killings in and around Wau which could have been ethnically or
politically motivated.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">On 20 March 2017 there was an alleged attack on a
Government Forces outpost at Natabu  Km to the south-west of Wau.

1.2  Incident:</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">The incident covered by this report is the killing of civilians in Wau on

the morning of  April 2017.

1.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">Aim</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">:</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The purpose of this report is to describe what happened and to attribute
responsibility for violations of the PCTSA where appropriate.
</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">1.4  Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">The MVT based in Wau reported the incidents as soon as they happened and
were immediately ordered by CTSAMM HQ to carry out an investigation.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">During the investigation the MVT was able to interview a large number of
witnesses to the killing of civilians in Wau, including some of those injured.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">In
order to do this they visited the hospital, the IDP site at the Catholic Church
and those areas of Wau affected by the violence.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">The MVT also met with and interviewed members of other international
organisations and the UN who were able to provide information.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The commander of and officers from !"</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">Division SPLA refused to discuss
events with the MVT, stating that permission would have to be obtained from
SPLA General Headquarters in Juba.  </a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">However, the MVT was able to meet
with the Police Commissioner and representatives of the local authorities.

2.0  Investigation - findings
2.1  Timeline:</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">The timeline of events is as follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40"> April:</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">Government Forces (5 Division SPLA) launched offensive operation
to clear opposition forces from areas to the south and south-west of Wau.
</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">Civilians displaced by the fighting started to enter the POC site.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43"> April:</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">At about 17.0  Hrs Government Forces vehicles were ambushed
about  Km south of Wau at Karukia on the Bazia road.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">Two senior officers
from " Division SPLA were killed together with a reported three soldiers.
</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">One of the officers was the chief of operations, and the other the head of
logistics, Major Bol Dut Dhuol who was brother of the Governor of what is
known as South-Western Lakes State based in Rumbek.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47"> April:</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">At about 6.0  Hrs groups of armed men, some in uniform and some
in civilian clothes, started shooting civilians in several areas of Wau town.
</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">This shooting went on until about 7.0  Hrs, by which time police and security
forces restored order.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">About 17000 people sought refuge in the POC area
by the UNMISS camp and with the Catholic Church.

2.0  Killing of civilians:</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">The MVT was able to gain first-hand witness statements
concerning the killing of civilians in Wau on  April.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">The evidence they gathered
is summarised as follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">At least 29 people were killed and at least  wounded on  April (figures
from the Police Commissioner in Wau).</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">None of those killed were Dinka. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">were police officers.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Some of those who did the killing were in uniform and some in civilian clothes.
</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">They were armed with AK47’s and PKM machine guns.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Numerous witnesses
testified that they called to people in the Dinka language and shot at those
who could not reply in that language.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">Some of the survivors described them
as ‘Gulweng’ IE armed cattle keepers.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">The killings took place in several residential area of Wau.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">Some reports
Suggest there were two main groups involved in the killing, one which started
shooting in the Nazareth area of the town and the other in the Hai Sikahdit
and Hai Bafara areas.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Some of those murdered had been killed in their houses, others killed in the
street.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">Several had been shot in the back whilst trying to escape.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">Witnessed described the town as being “full of soldiers” at the time of the
shooting.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">The Police Commissioner confirmed he had 29 open murder cases.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">At the
time of writing and to the knowledge of CTSAMM there have been no arrests
in connection with these murders.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">On 14 April National Security and 5th
Division SPLA personnel carried out a search for illegal weapons in several
areas of Wau and also at the Cattle Camp at New Site (about  Km south of
Wau).  </a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">cattle keepers were arrested for possession of illegal weapons but
later released due to lack of evidence.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">A committee was formed by the local
authorities to investigate the events of  April.

2.1  Displacement of civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">About 17,000 civilians took refuge in the two UNMISS
POC areas and with the three IDP sites at the Catholic Churches as a result of
the shooting.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">This added a significant burden to those providing shelter and
protection to an already large number of IDP’s.

3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">

3.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">A large number of citizens were murdered in Wau on the morning of  April.
</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">Some of those who did the killing were in military uniform.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">All the evidence
indicates there was an ethnic dimension to the killing, and that it is likely it was
in revenge for the killing of Government Forces officers on the ambush of  April.

3.2  Wau is firmly under control of the Government.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">There is a large SPLA garrison
within it.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">Witnesses and victims clearly identified many of those involved in the
deliberate killing of civilians as being “soldiers in uniform’.

3.3  At the very least Government Forces were in violation of the PCTSA in that they
clearly failed to protect those citizens in Wau who were of local Fertit ethnic

groups.

4.0  Conclusion:</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">

4.1      By so obviously failing to protect those citizens killed and wounded in Wau on
 April, Government Forces were in clear violation of the COHA, particularly:</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">
Article 3.0  of the COHA:</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">“The parties shall refrain from attacks on the civilian
population and commit to the protection of human rights, life and property...”

5.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">

5.1  The murder of 29 citizens took place in a town which is under the firm control of
Government Forces, the seat of a State Governor and home to an SPLA Division.
</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">Some of the perpetrators were in military uniform.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">At the  very least the
government is responsible for a gross failure of its commitment under the ARCSS
and COHA to protect civilians.

5.2.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">There was without doubt an ethnic dimension to the killings.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">This must be
acknowledged and addressed if there is ever to be peace in the area.

5.3  The underlying causes of conflict in the Wau area pre-date the current conflict.
</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">There cannot be peace until these issues are addressed at the political level, and
CTSAMM calls on JMEC to work with all parties to find solutions.
