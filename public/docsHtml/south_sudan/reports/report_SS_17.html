EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">On  September 2016 an SSPS officer was killed near to POC  in Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">On 
September there was an armed attack against an SSPS checkpoint again near to
POC  which resulted in the wounding of an SSPS officer.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">The Government alleged
that both these incidents were perpetrated by SPLM/A-IO personnel operating from
within POC 3.
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">After an extensive investigation the JTC concluded that the incidents did take place as
described, but there was no evidence that identified the attackers.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">It was therefore
not possible to conclude whether or not the incidents constituted violations of the
PCTSA.
</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">There are sporadic outbreaks of violence in or near the POC sites in Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">CTSAMM
recommends that all stakeholders examine ways or reducing tensions in and around
these POC sites.

attacks.
