CTSAMM VIOLATION REPORT NUMBER 006
PCTSE VIOLATIONS IN WESTERN EQUATORIA STATE

Executive Summary

On  and 11 February 2016 Government Forces in Western Equatoria State mounted
two operations.</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">The first in Mundi West County was directed against Bari and Gariya
and involved troops based in Mundri.</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">The second in Mundri East involved troops based
in Lanyi who advanced to and attacked the village of Lozoh.

</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">The civilian populations fled as soon as Government Forces arrived, and so there were
few casualties, although many houses  and crops burnt, and  agricultural produce,
livestock and valuable equipment such as grinding mills, clinic supplies and solar panels
were looted.

It is the opinion of CTSAMM that in mounting these operations Government Forces were

in clear violation of the PCTSA

months, with ongoing incidents between Government Forces and those of the
SPLM/A-IO and other armed groups.

1.2  Allegations:</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">The allegations covered by this report were in SPLM/A-IO letter
‘Report of Permanent Ceasefire Violations by GRSS' dated 14 Feb 2016 and

Garia.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">The attack on Bari has impeded the distribution of food to the IDP’s
and once again massive displacement of civilians has occurred.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">As a result
the WFP has moved the trucks carrying food to UNMISS compound in
Mundri.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">Mundri East County:</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">On 11 Feb GRSS Forces moved from their base in

people, government  officials and military officers,  and SPLM/A-IO civil
leaders and soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">All information was corroborated.
</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">•</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">The team also observed at first hand destruction wrought by the fighting, and

2.0  VIOLATIONS OF THE PCTSA
21     Government Forces operations in Bari and Gariya:</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">Onabout  February Government Forces troops moved south from Mundri
and attacked Bari.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">The MVT saw clear signs of fighting, including mortar
impacts, unexploded mortar shells and signs of heavy machinegun fire.
</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">There were also burnt tukuls and signs of looting:</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">for example the solar
panels and other items had been taken from the clinic.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">Witnesses said there were some hundreds of soldiers in eleven vehicles
including trucks and land cruisers, armed with AK47’s, heavy machineguns,
RPG's and mortars.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">When the attack started all the civilians fled into the
bush.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">Sounds of fighting were heard for about  days.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">When the MVT
visited there were only a few civilians in Bari, but there were soldiers who
claimed to be members of the SPLM/A-IO and under the command of
General Wesley Welbe.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">Government Forces moved on from Bari to Gariya and Bangolo.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">When the
MVT visited Gariya there were about 30 civilians who had apparently come
out of the bush to meet the team.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">There were no soldiers observed in Gariya.
</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">Those interviewed by the MVT confirmed that Government Forces had
moved from Bari and attacked Gariya, looting and burning houses.  </a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">The MVT
observed a large number of burnt tukuls (up to 150), and saw at first hand

burnt crops, food stores what was left at the looted clinic, which, like the clinic
at Bari had solar panels and other equipment taken.
</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">•</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">Displacement of civilians:</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50"> Government Forces operations in Bari and Gariya
have led to displacement of the civilian population, as observed by the MVT.
</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">•</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">Casualties:</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">
o Apart from one woman injured in the arm, no casualties were reported
by either the civilians or military in Bari.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">No casualties were reported in
Gariya;</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">there were also no reports of conflict-related sexual violence.
</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">The reason given for this was that everyone fled when the Government
Forces arrived.
</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">o Theallegation mentions 67 children being killed.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">There was no evidence
found or mention of any children being killed.
</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">•</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">Food distribution:</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">The fighting in the Bari and Gariya areas had disrupted
the distribution of food by UN agencies.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">However, the MVT found no
———————_=
evidence that Government Forces had deliberately impeded the distribution
of humanitarian aid.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Indeed, after the visit by the MVT to the area distribution
was continued.

22 Government Forces operations in Lozoh:</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">

* On 11 February Government Forces based in Lanyi moved out and attacked
the village of Lozoh.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">Witnesses stated about 100 troops were involved
travelling in about ten land cruisers and  APC.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Government officials and
SPLA officers in Lanyi freely admitted the attack had taken place.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">A significant number of houses were burnt and agricultural produce and
livestock looted.  </a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">grinding mills were also taken.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">The population fled into
the bush:</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">community leaders reported they heard gunshots at about 11.0 
Hrs and ran away.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">Buildings allegedly used by SPLM/A-IO elements in Lozoh had been burnt
down.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">The village appeared to have been prepared for defence:</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">the MVT
observed 28 foxholes (fighting positions) in the village.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">Local civilians
reported the use of tear gas by Government Forces, but the MVT found no
evidence of this.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">One UXO (a 66mm mortar round) was seen.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">Casualties:</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">

o 2men were burnt in their houses.</a></p>

alive but in a bad way.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">The MVT interviewed the injured man.

o A young girl with a condition which meant she could not be moved
easily was reportedly burnt to death.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">The MVT was shown her grave
next to the remains of the tukul in which she died.

o No other casualties were witnessed or reported by the team.

3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">

3.1  Itis the assessment of the JTC that Government Forces did carry out offensive
operations in Mundri West and East Counties as described in the allegations
received from the SPLM/A-IO and outlined in paragraph 1.0  above, and that
these operations have resulted in the displacement of the civilian population.

3.0  Witness statements, corroborated by the first hand observations of the MVT,
indicate that Government Forces indulged in significant looting and also the

emma
destruction of crops and agricultural produce, thus denying the civilian population
the means to support themselves.

3.1  The number of casualties was  grossly exaggerated in  the allegations.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">No
children — or indeed any civilians - were killed in Bari/Gariya.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">However, the MVT
was satisfied that two people had lost their lives as a result of the attack on Lozoh.

4.0  Conclusion

4.1__ Itis the opinion of CTSAMM that by mounting offensive operations against Bari,
Gariya and Lozoh Government Forces were in clear violation of article 1.0  of the

PCTSA, specifically:</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">
•</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">Article 1.1  of the COHA:</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">“The Parties hereby agree to cease all military
actions aimed at each other...”
•</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">Article 1.2.5:</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">“Acts of hostility, intimidation, violence or attacks against the
civilian population......”.
</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">5.0  Recommendations and observations:</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">
5.1  It is recommended by CTSAMM that JMEC does all in its power to encourage
dialogue between the Parties in order to limit tension and stop any further conflict.
</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">This would be facilitated by the early deployment of an AJMCC to the area.
</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">5.2  Incidents such as these would not happen if the military forces from both Parties
implemented the agreement and occupied their designated cantonment areas.
