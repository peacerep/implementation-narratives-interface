INVESTIGATIONS INTO VIOLATIONS OF THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES

AGREEMENT IN NASSIR, UPPER NILE STATE

1.0  Introduction

1.1  Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">Government Forces have been involved in burning grass around Nassir since the
start of the dry season on November 2014, resulting in the burning of tukuls which
have been ignited by the burning grass.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">The Government Forces commander, Brigadier General Peter Yuwal, has never
denied the burning of grass.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">Government Forces claim that the burning of grass is
a defensive measure so they can see any approaching SPLM/A-IO forces, and that
any tukuls that get burnt are ignited by accident.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">Brigadier Yual has, however,
admitted that some tukuls have been burnt by errant soldiers against his
instructions.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">At a routine meeting with Brigadier Yuwal on 14 January 2015 the issue of the
burning of tukuls was raised.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The Government Forces Military Intelligence (Ml)
officer Lt Paul Mabior said that tukuls were burnt because the SPLM/A-IO used
them as hideouts.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">He also expressed a lot of bitterness about the SPLM/A-IO who
he claimed “were attacking them”.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">The tukuls burnt belong to local Nuer people, who moved from Nassir as a result of
the fighting which started in December 2013.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">Since the incidents of 29 December
2014 to  January 2015 (V022) local people and SPLM/A-IO forces have moved
further away from Nassir and Government Forces have continued to burn grass
(and tukuls).

1.2       Incident:</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">On 19 January 2015 Government Forces carrying out maintenance work at the
Nassir airstrip set light to a mosque.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">When returning to their barracks, they also set fire
to several buildings in the area of the market and on 21 January burnt another building
in the market place.

1.3     Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">The aim of this report is to provide IGAD Special Envoys with a summary of the
incident that took place in Nassir on 19 and 21 January 2015, and apportion
responsibility for violations of the COHA.

<p><a id="27" name="27">IGAD JTC MVM

1.4         Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">Following initial reports received on 19 January 2015 from the MVT based at the
UNMISS camp at Nassir and employing Monitoring and Verification Mechanism
(MVM) Standard Operating Procedures, the JTC initiated the investigation /
verification sequence on by issuing an investigation order to the MVT on 20 January
2015.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">The MVT conducted investigations in accordance with the orders.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">They visited and
re-visited the sites of the burning and accessed information from a variety of sources,
especially the UNMISS MLO.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">They also discussed the issue with the Government
Forces commander.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">An Investigation and Verification report was submitted on the
evening of 22 January 2015.

2.0  Violations of COHA — NASSIR

19 January 2015

2.1       On 19 January 2015 at about 10.0  Hrs the Nassir MVT was involved with a joint patrol
of the Nassir area with UNMISS MLO.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">They visited the airstrip where they found about
two companies of Government Forces maintaining the airstrip.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">They found the
Government Forces Commander, Brigadier General Peter Yuwal, and his MI officer at
the site supervising the soldiers and took the opportunity to meet them.

22      The MVT left the airstrip at about 10.1  Hrs and proceeded with their patrol.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">After about
45 minutes they saw smoke rising from a building 10m away from where the Government
Forces soldiers were working at the airstrip.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">They moved towards the smoke as the
Government Forces were leaving.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">They found that the building that was on fire was a
mosque;</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">it was a substantial brick building with the roof and all combustible parts of it
on fire.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">They took photographs of it.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">At this point the Government Forces were passing
through the market place on their way back to their camp.

2.0      When the MVT returned to the UNMISS camp they climbed a watchtower and observed
a lot of smoke that appeared to be coming from buildings in the market place.

21 January 2015

2.1     On 21 January at 10.0  Hrs the MVT patrolled Nassir and the airstrip area in order to
further investigate the issue of the burning buildings.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">What they found was as follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">Inthe market place (N 08° 35’ 51.0” E 33° 03’ 36.0’):
o Two buildings — both shops — had been burned to the ground.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">The ash was
fresh, and the buildings were certainly those that the team had witnessed burning


IGAD JTC MVM
on 19 January.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">The exact location of the two buildings is:</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">

o A further building — which also looked like a shop — was on fire near a group of
Government Forces soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">There were several groups of soldiers in the town
collecting firewood and pumpkins and also burning grass, protected by a cordon
of small patrols stationed outside the town itself.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">The team took photographs.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">Atthe mosque (N 08° 37’ 5.0” E 33° 03’ 55.0’):</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">The MVT re-visited the site of the
mosque and took more photographs.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">Conversation with the Government Forces commander:</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">The MVT telephoned Brigadier
General Peter Yuwal and asked him about the burning of the mosque and shops.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">He
said that this was done without his orders and he would punish those responsible.

2.0      Assessment

•</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">Although Nassir town and its environs are under the control of Government Forces, all
the buildings and tukuls belong to members of the local Nuer community who support
the SPLM/A-IO.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">There is no doubt that Government Forces were responsible for deliberately burning the
mosque by the airstrip.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">This was witnessed by the MVT.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">It was a substantial brick-built
building that would need to have been set alight rather than caught fire accidentally.
</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Also, had it been set alight by accident the Government Forces responsible should have
tried to extinguish the fire.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">It is beyond any reasonable doubt that the two shops burnt in the market place on 19
January were set alight by Government Forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">It is also beyond reasonable doubt that
the building witnessed by the MVT burning on 21 January was also set alight by
Government Forces, who were in the area and made no attempt to save it.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">Despite previous assurances by the Government Forces commander that buildings were
only burnt by accident and against his orders, it is apparent that deliberate arson
continues.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">As already stated in V021 and V022 the burning of buildings is provocative
behavior that can only increase tensions in the area.
