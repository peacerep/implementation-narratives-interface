                                                        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">The NAS activities in Central Equatoria State created tension and fear causing most

|            civilians to flee to neighbouring countries and others to IDP Camps.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">While
conducting operations against NAS, the SSPDF blames most civilians in Central
Equatoria State especially the returnees to be either NAS forces or NAS supporters.
</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">This has created mistrust between the SSPDF forces operating in Central Equatoria
State and the civilians.
</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">On 19 May 22, an SSPDF soldier known as Cpl Keat Gatkuoth Keat based at Abaya
Barracks left his unit on foot heading to SSPDF  Bde Mundari Barracks which is
about 27 kms away from his Barracks, but he did not reach his destination and
therefore went missing for  days.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">He was later discovered dead and his
decomposing dead body was found tied to a tree on 26 May 22, in ltorege village,
Kiri Boma.
</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">The community informed the police officer in-charge of Leikor Police post who in turn
informed the SSPDF Mundari Barracks Commander, Col Kamilo, who subsequently
sent SSPDF soldiers to the scene.
</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">Police and SSPDF soldiers arrested four suspects namely Mr. Justine Leju, Mr.
Saviour Yamba, Ms. Jesca Kabang and Mr. Tahah Yiiga an immediate neighbour to
the three persons.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">When SSPDF soldiers from Mundari Barracks arrived at the
scene, their commander Maj Deng Makwuach told the soldiers who were
interrogating the suspects that, “there was no need to speak to rebels who had killed
their fellow soldier, that they were also looking for the Community Chief who
according to them was harbouring rebels who are killing soldiers’.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">Maj Deng
Makwuach instructed the five soldiers to shoot the three male suspects, which they
did, killing them instantly.
</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">The actions of the SSPDF soldiers were unlawful and further severed the already
strained relations between the residents of Kajo Keji and the SSPDF in Mundari
Barracks.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">The killing of the civilians contravenes article  (a) of ACOH 2017 and
articles 2.1.10.0.1  and 2.0.10.0.4  of R-ARCSS 2018, among others.

<p><a id="78" name="78">The arrest and torture of the suspects was on

suspects for the murder of their colleague.
</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">f.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">The Military Intelligence Officer of Jalei Barracks informed Col Kamilo the
commander of SSPDF  Bde, that the body had badly decomposed to be

<p><a id="84" name="84">The soldiers arrested the two (2) civilians, bundled them into the
vehicle and drove with them to Kiri Centre.
</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">|                h.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">Upon reaching Kiri Centre, the SSPDF soldiers informed the community
that they had come to carry their colleague’s body and therefore asked the
civilians to lead them to the scene.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">While still at Kiri Centre, they released
Mr. Tilaing Frances after the police men were able to identify him as a
known civilian.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">However, at the same Centre the SSPDF soldiers identified
and recognized among the crowd a man called Yogo, an alleged deserter
from SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">They arrested and detained him together with Mr.
Shadrack Taban and locked them in one of the empty shops at Kiri Boma
Centre guarded by one soldier, after which the SSPDF vehicle proceeded
to scene.
</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">i.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">When they arrived at the scene, the Commander of the soldiers Major
Deng Makuach vowed that if the suspects did not reveal who killed the
soldier, his soldiers would shoot them.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">He further told the soldiers who
were interrogating the suspects that, “there was no need to speak to
rebels who had killed their fellow soldier, that they were also looking for
the Community Chief who according to them was harboring rebels who are
akin to killing soldiers”.
</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">j. The suspects maintained that they did not know who killed the soldier and
that they did not know the owner of the clothes that were found near the
                dead body.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">At this point Major Deng Makuach ordered the soldiers to
shoot the suspects.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">The five soldiers shot the three male suspects killing
them instantly sparing the girl.

<p><a id="96" name="96">|                  k. Leaving the dead bodies of the three civilians on the scene, the soldiers

<p><a id="97" name="97">They
|                        drove through Kiri Centre and collected the other two (2) suspects namely
Mr. Shadrack Taban and Mr. Yogo and took them along to their Barracks

<p><a id="104" name="104">On 31 May 2022, the SSPDF- Chief of Defence Forces, Gen Santino Deng
Wol Chok raised concern to the Governor of Central Equatoria State, Hon
Emmanuel Adil Anthony about the persistence of such same incidents in Kajo
Keji areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">He proposed to the Hon Governor to form a “fact finding
committee” comprised of members from Central Equatoria State, SSPDF-MI,

<p><a id="108" name="108">The Commissioner of Yei County together with the Commander of the SSPDF

<p><a id="109" name="109">Assessment
          8.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">The actions of the SSPDF soldiers were unlawful and further severed the
already strained relations between the residents of Kajo Keji and the SSPDF in
Mundari Barracks.</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">The actions are detrimental to the efforts of the peace
process and erodes the gains already made towards a safer, secure and
peaceful County that attracts the return of the refugees and IDPs to their homes.
</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">|              9.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">The SSPDF acts of intimidation, the tying and beating of the four (4) suspects
namely Justine Leju, Saviour Yamba, Jesca Kabang and Tahah Yiiga amounts

|               to torture, inhuman and degrading treatment to civilians which is contrary to

|             article  (c) of ACoH and articles 2.0.9, 2.1.10.0  and 2.0.10.0.4  of the R-
ARCSS.

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">Further, Article  (1) of ACoH requires the military to protect civilians from any
forms of attack from other armed actors.</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">The killing of the suspects namely
Justine Leju, Saviour Yamba and Tahah Yiiga contravenes article  (a) of ACoH
and articles 2.0.10.0.1  and 2.0.10.0.4  of RRARCSS among others.

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">It is very clear that the three civilians Justine Leju, Saviour Yamba and Tahah
Yiiga were killed by the SSPDF soldiers from Mundari Barracks in the presence
of their family members and Kiri Community.

12.</a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">According to the statements made by Maj Deng Makuach, the killing of the
three civilians was in revenge for their dead soldier whom he unjustifiably
concluded that he was killed by the deceased civilians, R-ARCSS 2.0.9.</a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">The civilians in Kiri Boma of Kongapo1 in Kajo Keji County are generally living
in fear due to the continuous mistreatment by the SSPDF soldiers some of
whom walk in villages armed and drunk posing a danger to the residents.</a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">This
situation has resulted to many of the population to run back to the IDP camps in
Uganda which possibly scares away those who were planning to return.

</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">Conclusions

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">It is the conclusion CTSAMVM that Mr. Saviour Yamba, Mr. Justine Leju and
Mr. Tahah Yiiga were killed in cold blood by the SSPDF soldiers of Mundari
Barracks, after a body of a soldier was found within a distance of about 150
meters from their homesteads.</a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">It is apparent that the three civilians were not
given an opportunity to be heard and hence the SSPDF soldiers took the law
in their hands.

<p><a id="125" name="125">Maj Deng</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">Makuach should be held responsible for issuing unlawful orders to

shoot and kill the three (3) civilians namely Justine Leju, Saviour Yamba and

<p><a id="127" name="127">The five (5) SSPDF soldiers who shot and killed the three (3) civilians are
                  equally liable for their actions of executing an unlawful order by their
|                  Commander.

17.SSPDF High command should ensure that commanders at all levels enforce

discipline in the ranks and exercise proper command and control of their
|                        soldiers plus the weapons entrusted to them.
</a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">|               18.SSPDF leadership should ensure that the Commanders are properly guided
