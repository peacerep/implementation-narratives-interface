<p><a id="17" name="17">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
During October and November 2021 in Yambio County, SPLM/A-IO military forces
conducted what was termed a ‘mobilisation exercise’ to round up SPLM/A-IO
deserters.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">During the course of the activity forced recruitment took place after which
civilians were taken to the SPLM/A-IO camp at Li-Rangu and onwards to the Maridi
Training Centre.
</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">In the course of the recruitment a young girl was taken to Li -Rangu SPLM/A-IO
camp and forced to become a ‘wife’ of an officer.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">SPLM/A-IO took money from the
families of the recruited civilians in order to facilitate their release.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">Amongst the
individuals recruited by the SPLM/A-IO were child soldiers.
</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that:</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">
</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">By recruiting civilians in the Yambio County area in October and November
2021, the SPLM/A-IO acted in violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically article
2.1.8.
</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">By abducting civilians and extorting money for their release the SPLM/A-IO
acted in violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically 2.2.10. 7.0.
</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">By abducting and placing a vulnerable person, a girl, into the hands of
SPLM/A-IO officers the SPLM/A-IO acted in violation of the R-ARCSS,
specifically 2.0.10.0.
</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">By recruiting civilians under the age of 18 the SPLM/A-lO acted in violation of
the R-ARCSS, specifically 2.0.10.0.
</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">Throughout the investigation the SPLM/A-IO provided complete access to
CTSAMVM and co-operated in every possible way.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">The co-operation demonstrated
by SPLM/A-IO Div 9B should be used as a model for all parties when CTSAMVM
conduct investigations of serious allegations.

the SPLM/A-IO that they intended to collect soldiers who had “deserted”
Cantonment Sites and were living amongst the civilian population.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">This move
was welcomed by the County Commissioner because some of these SPLM/A-
 soldiers were allegedly becoming involved in criminal activities and causing
problems.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">

Solomon, commander of SPLM/A-IO Div 9B. He said that the girl had “been

their soldier since 2016 and that the Deputy Governor's actions were purely
political shenanigans”.</a></p>

Hon.</a></p>
<p><a id="178" name="178">Alfred Futiyo, who again said that the girl had been with him in 2016, she
was not a minor and had willingly re-joined the SPLM/A-lO.

c. CTSAMVM was unable to interview the girl in question, but has been told by
the Deputy Governor that she is with her parents who deny she was ever a
soldier.

</a></p>
<p><a id="194" name="194">i. The Chairman, the Deputy Governor of WES (Hon Dr Kennedy Goaniko)
reminded the meeting that alleged recruitment by the SPLM/A-IO was the
key agenda issue.</a></p>
<p><a id="195" name="195">He said that the WES Governor, Hon. Alfred Futiyo,
had admitted that there was forceful recruitment, and that 120 people
were arrested and taken to R-Rangu.</a></p>

be civilians and that he (the Governor) had directed  they should be
released.

ii.</a></p>

from Maridi Training Centre (see para  above).

ili.</a></p>
<p><a id="198" name="198">Maj Gen Simon Ali Solomon SPLM/A-IO refuted the claims of recruitment
and insisted the SPLM/A-IO were just “mobilising their soldiers who had
deserted from their Cantonment Sites”.

<p><a id="199" name="199">The State Security Committee agreed that all forms of recruitment should
Stop forthwith.</a></p>

made to the Yambio County Commissioner, who would share them with
CTSAMVM.</a></p>
<p><a id="203" name="203">Further the SPLM/A-IO should liaise with organised security
forces to address the issue of armed soldiers hiding in communities.

<p><a id="250" name="250">Forcible recruitment:</a></p>
<p><a id="251" name="251">The mobilisation conducted by SPLM/A-IO Division 6B of
Sector  based in Ri-Rangu was intended to round up SPLM/A-IO deserters.
</a></p>
<p><a id="252" name="252">However, the activity also resulted in forcible recruitment in the Yambio County
12       M
area in October and November 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="253" name="253">This is evidenced by victim statements and
by information given by citizens and local authorities/traditional leaders.</a></p>
<p><a id="254" name="254">Further
evidence is provided by the Acting Chief Instructor of Maridi Training Centre who
Said he had to release two members of fire and wildlife services who had been
“abducted on the way</a></p>
<p><a id="255" name="255">[to the Training Centre]”.</a></p>
<p><a id="256" name="256">In addition, CTSAMVM identified
two other individuals who were recruited but subsequently released, one of whom
was released after his family paid money to SPLM/A-IO Div 9B.

<p><a id="257" name="257">Scale of Recruitment.  </a></p>
<p><a id="258" name="258">Allegations were made that there was large scale forced
recruitment underway in Yambio County.</a></p>
<p><a id="259" name="259">CTSAMVM is not able to verify the scale
of recruitment, there are  conflicting accounts on the numbers  involved.</a></p>
<p><a id="260" name="260">The
statement made by the Deputy Governor at the State Security Committee meeting
that 60 forcefully recruited civilians had been taken to Li-Rangu could not be
substantiated.</a></p>
<p><a id="261" name="261">However CTSAMVM   conducted extensive  engagements with
Boma chiefs, village headmen, and youth leaders and it is assessed that the
recruitment was greater than the Specified cases outlined in Para 13.

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="262" name="262">Duration of recruitment:</a></p>
<p><a id="263" name="263">The “mobilisation exercise” carried out by the SPLM/A-IO
did not finish at the end of October as claimed by the commander of SPLM/A-IO
Division 9B. This is evidenced by victim and witness statements, and also by the
fact that the release letters held by CTSAMVM are dated 20 and 22 November.

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="264" name="264">Extortion:</a></p>
<p><a id="265" name="265">The SPLM/A-IO has been extorting money from civilians abducted in
Yambio County.</a></p>
<p><a id="266" name="266">This is evidenced by statements made by witnesses and victims,
and also by the statement by Maj Gen Simon Samuel Ali Solomon, who admitted
that “some of his officers might have extorted money from victim’s families”.</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="268" name="268">17.Fear:</a></p>
<p><a id="269" name="269">People in Yambio County are scared of being forcibly recruited.</a></p>
<p><a id="270" name="270">This is
evidenced not only by statements recorded by CTSAMVM, but also CTSAMVM's
observations on the ground.</a></p>
<p><a id="271" name="271">

18.</a></p>
<p><a id="272" name="272">SGBV:</a></p>
<p><a id="273" name="273">The case of the young girl allegedly forcibly taken to and held at Ri-Rangu
(paragraphs 7a) is a strong indicator of SGBV, in particular forced marriage.</a></p>
<p><a id="274" name="274">The
evidence for this is that she clearly said that she had been given as a “wife” to an
SPLM/A-IO officer.</a></p>
<p><a id="275" name="275">It is of concern that, according to her statement, she was
abducted along with two other girls.</a></p>
<p><a id="276" name="276">The case of the 15 year-old girl at Maridi
Training Centre (paragraph 8) is also of concern.</a></p>

<p><a id="278" name="278">Underage trainees at Maridi Training Centre:</a></p>

old.

</a></p>
<p><a id="280" name="280">Conclusions

20.CTSAMVM concludes that
a. By forcefully recruiting civilians, including minors, in the Yambio County area

in October and November 2021, the SPLM/A-IO acted in violation of the R-
ARCSS, specifically articles 2.0.8, 2.1.10.0  and 2.0.10.0.</a></p>
<p><a id="281" name="281">

</a></p>
<p><a id="282" name="282">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="283" name="283">By abducting civilians and extorting money for their release the SPLM/A-IO
acted in violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically 2.0.10.</a></p>
<p><a id="284" name="284">7.0.

c. By abducting and placing a vulnerable female minor into the hands of an
SPLM/A-lO officer in a form of forced marriage the SPLM/A-IO acted in
violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically 2.0.10.0.</a></p>

<p><a id="286" name="286">Observations and Recommendations

21.</a></p>
<p><a id="287" name="287">General:</a></p>
<p><a id="288" name="288">It is apparent that an agreed exercise by the SPLM/A-IO to “mobilise”
“deserters” in order to remove them from communities and return them to
Cantonment Sites, turned into forced recruitment of civilians who had no military
training and had not been in the SPLM/A-IO.

<p><a id="289" name="289">Follow-up information from  Saura Boma:</a></p>
<p><a id="290" name="290">On 20 December 2021  CTSAMVM
conducted a follow-up visit to Saura Boma, where they spoke toa traditional leader
who told CTSAMVM that:</a></p>
<p><a id="291" name="291">

</a></p>
<p><a id="292" name="292">a. That the situation in his Boma is returning to normal.</a></p>
<p><a id="293" name="293">Ever since CTSAMVM
moved around the area making inquiries, there have been no further cases of
forced recruitment.</a></p>
<p><a id="294" name="294">The Youths are slowly gaining confidence and returning
back to their villages.

</a></p>
<p><a id="295" name="295">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="296" name="296">That two weeks previously an escapee from Maridi Training Centre returned
to the area.</a></p>
<p><a id="297" name="297">He had never been a member of the SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="298" name="298">He reported

<p><a id="301" name="301">Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="302" name="302">CTSAMVM recommends that:</a></p>
<p><a id="303" name="303">

</a></p>
<p><a id="304" name="304">a. Action is taken by JDB to Stop recruitment throughout the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="305" name="305">

</a></p>
<p><a id="306" name="306">b. The SPLM/A-IO takes the necessary measures to instil discipline in Division
9b, and ensures that those guilty of recruitment are held accountable.</a></p>
<p><a id="307" name="307">

</a></p>
<p><a id="308" name="308">c. That the SPLM/A-IO investigates the case of the young girl allegedly given as
a “wife” to an officer at Li-Rangu (paragraph 7a).

</a></p>
<p><a id="309" name="309">d. The WES security committee is congratulated for highlighting the concerns
raised over recruitment and for its pro-active stance to stop the recruitment and
mobilisation.

€.</a></p>
<p><a id="310" name="310">The investigation into the circumstances of recruitment in Yambio County was
complex and covered a number of  sensitive areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="311" name="311">Throughout the
investigation state officials and the leadership of SPLMA/IO Div 9B and the
Maridi Training Centre cooperated fully with CTSAMVM.</a></p>
<p><a id="312" name="312">Access to conduct

<p><a id="313" name="313">CTSAMVM believes the behaviour and action of those
being investigated is a model of how parties should assist CTSAMVM in
fulfilling its mandate.</a></p>
<p><a id="314" name="314">It is regrettable that some other parties do not render the
