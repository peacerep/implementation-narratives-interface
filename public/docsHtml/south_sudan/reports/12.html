Executive Summary 

This report on the status of implementation of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution 
of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) has been prepared pursuant to article 
7.9 of Chapter VII of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">The report covers the period from 1 April 2021 to 30 June 
2021  and  builds  on  the  previous  quarterly  Report  No.  010/21.  </a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">It  provides  a  status  update  on 
progress or lack thereof in the implementation of the tasks of the R-ARCSS during the reporting 
period, highlight challenges facing the implementation, provide observations and concludes with 
recommendations for remedial measures.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">

The  quarterly  report  benefitted  from  information  from  various  data  sources,  including 
periodic reports from Agreement institutions and mechanisms, participatory peer-reviews by the 
RJMEC  thematic  Working  Committees,  Reconstituted  Joint  Monitoring  and  Evaluation 
Commission  (RJMEC)  monthly  plenary  meetings,  and  consultative  meetings  with  various  R-
ARCSS  stakeholders.  </a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">The  information  from  various  sources  including  field  visits  were  then 
triangulated to ensure accuracy of this report.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">

Accordingly, the report highlights the tasks which have been accomplished to include, inter 
alia,  the  dissolution  of  the  Transitional  National  Legislature  (TNL),  comprising  the  National 
Transitional  Legislative  Assembly  (TNLA)  and  the  Council  of  States;</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26"> reconstitution  and 
appointment of the TNLA;</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">steps undertaken to establish an ad-hoc Judicial Reform Committee 
(JRC)  with  the  mandate  to  study  and  recommend  appropriate  judicial  reforms;</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28"> a  roadmap 
developed for the establishment of the three transitional justice mechanisms;</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">establishment of a 
Technical  Committee  for  the  National  Consultative  Process  on  the  Establishment  of  the 
Commission  for  Truth,  Reconciliation  and  Healing  (CTRH);</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30"> and  successful  completion  of  a 
workshop  for  the  Parties  to  the  R-ARCSS,  which  enabled  them  to  agree  on  the  details  of 
conducting the permanent constitution-making process as mandated in the R-ARCSS.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">Notwithstanding  the  positive  progress  made  in  the  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS 
highlighted above, the report nevertheless shows that some key tasks of the R-ARCSS still remain 
outstanding.  </a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">These  include,  among  others,  the  swearing  in  of  the  reconstituted  TNLA;</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">
reconstitution of the Council of States, the States Legislature, and restructuring and reconstitution 
of Institutions and Commissions at the national level;</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">completion of all tasks related to Phase I of 
the Necessary Unified Forces (NUF), including graduation, harmonization of ranks as well as the 
unified  command  structure  and  redeployment  of  the  trained  NUF;</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35"> operationalization  of  DDR 
processes;</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36"> establishment  of  the  Special  Reconstruction  Fund  and  Board;</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37"> and  establishment  of 
Agreement institutions such as the Economic Financial Management Authority (EFMA), and the 
three  Transitional  Justice  institutions  being  the  CTRH,  the  Compensation  and  Reparation 
Authority (CRA) and Hybrid Court for South Sudan (HCSS), among others.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">

Furthermore, the report observes the main impediments to effective implementation of the 
peace  process  that  need  to  be  tackled.  </a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">They  include,  among  others,  insufficiency  of  funds  and 
requisite  resources  for  effective  and  efficient  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS;</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40"> relational 
challenges arising from trust deficit and lack of sufficient confidence between some elements of 
the Parties to the R-ARCSS;</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">the stalled implementation of the Transitional Security Arrangements 
including the establishment of the NUF;</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">recurrence of community-based violence and insecurity 
in  some  parts  of  the  country;</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43"> institutional  capacity  gaps  in  some  Agreement  institutions  and 

 

iv 

mechanisms;</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">negative impact of the activities of holdout groups in some areas of Equatoria and 
the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the overall peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">

To ensure that the main impediments to implementation of the R-ARCSS are addressed in a 
timely manner, and that the peace process remains on track, the RJMEC leadership continued with 
high-level  diplomatic  engagements  with  various  stakeholders  during  the  reporting  period.  </a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">The 
RJMEC Interim Chairperson held meetings with the RTGoNU Presidency, Ministers, Parties to 
the R-ARCSS, various stakeholders, regional and international guarantors.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">RJMEC also regularly 
briefed the Chairperson of the Assembly of IGAD Heads of State and Government, Chairperson 
of the IGAD Council of Ministers, regional and international Special Envoys.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">He also briefed the 
72nd Extraordinary Session of the IGAD Council of Ministers on the status of implementation, 
challenges and recommended remedial actions.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">The report therefore concludes with the following recommendations to various stakeholders, 
including  the  RTGoNU,  the  regional  and  international  guarantors,  and  the  international

<p><a id="148" name="148">On  8  May  2021,  H.E.  Salva  Kiir  Mayardit,  President  of  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan 
dissolved  the  TNL  comprising  the  TNLA  and  the  CoS.  Two  days  later,  the  President 
reconstituted  the  TNLA  from  332  members  to  550  based  on  the  responsibility-sharing 
arrangement provided for under article 1.14.2 of  the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="149" name="149">By the end of the reporting 
period, the CoS was yet to be reconstituted. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="150" name="150">10.  </a></p>
<p><a id="151" name="151">RJMEC’s preliminary gender analysis of the appointments to the reconstituted TNLA 
suggests that, overall, women constitute 33% of its members, falling short of the 35% minimum 
threshold the R-ARCSS requires the Parties to adhere to, and the gender disaggregation of the 
appointments remains a concern.</a></p>
<p><a id="152" name="152">That notwithstanding, the appointment of the RTNLA is a 
welcome development insofar as implementation of the governance aspects of the Agreement 
under Chapter 1 is concerned.</a></p>
<p><a id="153" name="153">However, it is critical that the RTNLA is sworn in to commence 
its  business,  including  passage  of  the  national  budget  and  ratification  of  important  pending 
legislations, such as all the amended security bills and the Constitutional Amendment Bill No.

<p><a id="161" name="161">With regard to Judicial Reforms under Article 1.17 of the R-ARCSS, the following tasks 
were expected to have been completed within the first twelve months of the Transitional Period 
namely:</a></p>
<p><a id="162" name="162">establishment of the ad-hoc JRC and completion of its activities.</a></p>
<p><a id="163" name="163">Once established and

<p><a id="165" name="165">The 
MoJCA, working together with RJMEC and IGAD advisors developed and adopted a Terms 
of Reference for the establishment of the JRC, and plans are underway to invite the Parties to 
the  R-ARCSS  to  nominate  their  representatives  to  the  JRC,  and  for  IGAD  to  secure  its

<p><a id="170" name="170">During  the  reporting  period,  H.E.  Rebecca  Nyandeng  de  Mabior,  Vice  President  and 
Head of the Gender and Youth Cluster launched the South Sudanese Women Leadership Forum 
under the theme:</a></p>
<p><a id="171" name="171">‘Strengthening Women's Participation in Peace and Nation-Building’.</a></p>
<p><a id="172" name="172">The 
Forum  brought  together  South  Sudanese  women  leaders  from  political,  faith-based  groups, 
civil society, private sector, business sector, security sector, justice institutions, academia, and

<p><a id="173" name="173"> 
16.  </a></p>
<p><a id="174" name="174">The Forum is established as a platform to assist women in addressing multiple issues 
that prevent  gender equality  and women empowerment  in  various fields, and to  engage and 
hold political and government leaders accountable with regards to promoting and implementing 
all gender related commitments made by the signatories, stakeholders as well as the guarantors 
under the R-ARCSS and the Transitional Constitution of the Republic of South Sudan (TRCSS)

<p><a id="176" name="176">Under  Article  1.18  of  the  R-ARCSS,  the  National  Constitutional  Amendment 
Committee  (NCAC)  was  expected  to  have  completed  drafting,  review  and  amendment  of 
several legislations, including the National Elections Act, the NGO Act, Bank of South Sudan 
Act,  Anti-Corruption  Act,  National  Audit  Chambers  Act,  National  Petroleum  Act  amongst 
other, and to incorporate any reforms relevant to the Agreement or international best practices, 
within twelve months into the Transitional Period. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="177" name="177">18.  </a></p>
<p><a id="178" name="178">By  22  February  2021,  when  the  NCAC’s  mandate  expired,  it  was  in  the  process  of 
reviewing the Public Finance Management Act and the National Audit Chambers Act, but these 
were yet to be finalised and handed over to the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="179" name="179">The  NCAC  had  also  started  the  review  of  the  Petroleum  Act  and  Petroleum  Revenue 
Management Act.

</a></p>
<p><a id="180" name="180">In  order  to  complete  these  pending  laws,  as  well  as  review  and  amend  the  National 
Elections Act and the NGO Act, the NCAC requested for extension of its mandate for another 
twelve (12) months.</a></p>
<p><a id="181" name="181">All the Parties to the R-ARCSS endorsed the request for an extension of 
the NCAC working period.</a></p>
<p><a id="182" name="182">However, due to financial challenges, the IGAD office has not yet 
reconvened  the  NCAC.  </a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="187" name="187">This, despite the volatile security situation in parts of Central and Western Equatoria due to

the end of May 2021 in Lainya County, Central Equatoria with the abduction from a church, 
and the subsequent summary execution of a 9-year-old boy, a pastor, and two other men by 
allegedly SSPDF personnel.</a></p>
<p><a id="189" name="189">Both the SSPDF and NAS denied responsibility for the incidents, 
but the SSPDF issued a statement stating that they were going to launch an investigation into 
the matter.</a></p>
<p><a id="190" name="190">RJMEC has recommended that CTSAMVM also investigate the incident.</a></p>
<p><a id="191" name="191"> 
21.  </a></p>
<p><a id="192" name="192">Community-based  violence  persisted  throughout  the  reporting  period,  across  the 
Equatorias.</a></p>
<p><a id="193" name="193">Most incidents involved cattle raiding and revenge attacks between the Bor Dinka 
and  Mundari  tribes.  </a></p>
<p><a id="194" name="194">Also,  communal  violence  between  the  Buya  and  Toposa  tribes,  youth 
harassment  of  humanitarian  workers,  as  well  as  ambushes  on  civilian  vehicles  by  criminal 
groups  worsened  the  security  situation  in  Eastern  Equatoria.  </a></p>
<p><a id="195" name="195">On  31  May  in  Torit,  Eastern 
Equatoria, vehicles belonging to the UNDP and the International Community of the Red Cross 
(ICRC) were looted and personnel robbed by local youth.</a></p>
<p><a id="196" name="196">Of much concern is the major threat 
to peace posed by inter-communal violence, which has negatively impacted the implementation 
of  the  Agreement  as  some  Cantonment  Sites  have  been  attacked  by  local  youths,  leading 
Cantonment personnel to rearm themselves in self-defence. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="197" name="197">22.  </a></p>
<p><a id="198" name="198">Between  the  areas  of  Bunj  and  Maban  in  Upper  Nile  state,  the  Bantaween  militia 
attacked the Beneshowa community and also the Liang cantonment site.</a></p>
<p><a id="199" name="199">However, the South 
Sudan Liberation Army in Opposition (SPLA)-IO in the area successfully repelled the militia 
attacks.  </a></p>
<p><a id="200" name="200">Also in Jonglei an attack in May 2021 by the Gawar Nuer and the Dinka youth on 
Gumuruk and Likungole was reported to have killed 105 men and 28 women, whilst 72 women 
and 84 children were abducted.</a></p>
<p><a id="201" name="201">On 28 May 2021, community-based violence in Ulang County 
resulted  in  43  civilian  deaths.  </a></p>
<p><a id="202" name="202">In  addition,  on  24  May  2021,  a  humanitarian  warehouse  was 
attacked in Koch County, Unity State by an unknown armed group and over 500 tons of food 
was stolen or destroyed. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="203" name="203">23.  </a></p>
<p><a id="204" name="204">During  the  reporting  period,  National  Monitors  boycotted  participation  in  the 
CTSAMVM structures after financial support from the government of Japan ended in March. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="205" name="205">During  the  boycott,  the  National  Monitors  intentionally  prevented  the  regional  and 
international monitors from deploying, monitoring or investigating incidents in all their areas 
of responsibility.</a></p>
<p><a id="206" name="206">Direct threats were made to CTSAMVM personnel by the National Monitors, 
and in some cases with the support of government security agencies.</a></p>
<p><a id="207" name="207"> 
24.  </a></p>
<p><a id="208" name="208">These  actions  consequently  significantly  undermined  CTSAMVM’s  operational 
capability  and  performance.  </a></p>
<p><a id="209" name="209">Consequently,  the  RJMEC  Chairperson  wrote  to  the  President 
requesting his intervention in the matter.  </a></p>
<p><a id="210" name="210">During the last week of June 2021,  funds were made 
available to CTSAMVM by the Chairperson of the National Transitional Committee (NTC), 
for  the  specific  purpose  of  providing  salaries    for  the  National  Monitors,  thus  successfully 
resolving the issue.</a></p>
<p><a id="211" name="211">The National Monitors  resumed work on 22 June 2021. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="212" name="212">25.  </a></p>
<p><a id="213" name="213">The  SSPDF  leadership  established  a  Military  Mobile  Court  in  Malual  Chat,  Jonglei 
State, and a General Court Martial in Warrap State to deal with crimes committed by soldiers. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="214" name="214">These are very positive developments similar to the District Field Court Martial established by 
the SSPDF in Yei in mid-2020, which prosecuted several soldiers for crimes committed against 
both  the  military  and  civilians.  </a></p>
<p><a id="215" name="215">At  the  time,  the  actions  of  the  Court  significantly  improved

this period, CTSAMVM reported on incidents of SPLM/A-IO soldiers who allegedly assaulted 
two girls in Wau IDP camp on 14 June 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="219" name="219">Local police confirmed that there were two other

<p><a id="220" name="220">With regards to accountability, SSPDF established 
military justice mechanisms mentioned above to deal with both military discipline cases as well 
as crimes against civilians in Jonglei and Warrap State.</a></p>
<p><a id="221" name="221">The Court’s jurisdiction includes cases

<p><a id="225" name="225">As a result, morale has deteriorated.</a></p>
<p><a id="226" name="226">A significant number of personnel have left the

34.  </a></p>
<p><a id="260" name="260">Overall, there has been some improvements in the status of provision of humanitarian 
assistance  to  those  in  need,  including  the  gradual  returns  by  previously  internally  displaced 
persons (IDPs) and refugees.</a></p>
<p><a id="261" name="261">However, UNOCHA estimates suggest that 7.2 million people in 
South  Sudan  continue  to  be  acutely  food  insecure  between  April  and  July  and  the  need  for 
relief remains high.</a></p>
<p><a id="262" name="262"> 
35.  </a></p>
<p><a id="263" name="263">Compounding  the  humanitarian  challenge  is  the  concerns  regarding  the  state  of 
insecurity  in  some  parts  of  the  country,  which  continue  to  undermine  current  progress,

including the slowing down of voluntary returns thus  increasing  the risks of reversing some 
of the gains already made.</a></p>
<p><a id="264" name="264">Around the country, there are reported incidences of violence such 
as the clashes between the SSPDF and NAS in Central Equatoria, community-based violence 
in Jonglei, Lakes, Warrap, and Unity States which resulted in many civilian casualties.</a></p>
<p><a id="265" name="265">Taken 
together,  all  these  amount  to  a  worrying  composite  security  picture  of  the  country  and  the 
context in which humanitarian agencies operate 
36.  </a></p>
<p><a id="266" name="266">This year, four aid workers have been killed, including one on 12 May2 and two on 7 
June 2021 in  Lakes State, highlighting the continued dangers faced by aid  workers in  some 
parts of the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="267" name="267">The safety and security of humanitarian workers therefore continues to be 
threatened  by  the  ongoing  violence.  </a></p>
<p><a id="268" name="268">There  have  been  recent  compound  intrusions  and  the 
physical assault of aid workers in Upper Nile state, Unity State and Eastern Equatoria.</a></p>
<p><a id="269" name="269">Further, 
concerns on road security, notably in Lakes, Jonglei, and the Equatorias, continue to impede 
the delivery of aid to those who most need it.</a></p>
<p><a id="270" name="270">Some youths have reportedly been demonstrating 
in Torit, Eastern Equatoria and have been demanding for employment of locals in international 
organizations.</a></p>
<p><a id="271" name="271">They reportedly issued threats to  undermine the work of such organizations if 
their demands are not met.</a></p>

<p><a id="273" name="273">The Special Reconstruction Fund (SRF) and its Board which is mandated to assess the 
reconstruction needs and raise the necessary funds are vital aspects of the Peace Agreement. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="274" name="274">This body was supposed to be established during the first month of the Transitional Period, 
and, upon its establishment, a donors’ conference is to be convened to coordinate support to 
the  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="275" name="275">To  date,  neither  the  Fund  nor  the  Board    have    been 
established.</a></p>
<p><a id="276" name="276">This calls for urgency in the part of the RTGoNU to prioritise their establishment 
and the eventual convening of the donors’ conference.</a></p>
<p><a id="277" name="277">The RTGoNU, as required by the R-
ARCSS, is expected to provide initial funding of USD 100 million per annum for the duration

at the end of June, compared to an average of around USD 42 in 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="282" name="282">Also, the IMF transferred 
more  than  USD  174  million  under  the  Rapid  Credit  Facility,  against  the  background  of  the

have  been  conducted.  </a></p>
<p><a id="293" name="293">These  reports  have  still  to  be  made  public,  but  from  what  has  been 
reported from the Ministry of Petroleum, the audits confirm that the central government has 
withheld significant  parts of the transfers  and has thereby accumulated large arears in  these 
transfers.</a></p>
<p><a id="294" name="294">Audits of cost recovery (deductions by the oil companies for investment and other 
costs  related  to  oil  production)  since  (2012)  show,  according  government  officials  that  oil 
companies have been overcompensated for costs they have incurred, which thereby has reduced 
profits and the government’s share of oil production.</a></p>

important against the background of environmental damage from oil spills and for putting in 
place  policies  to  protect  health  and  the  environment.  </a></p>
<p><a id="298" name="298">According  to  the  Petroleum  Ministry,

<p><a id="304" name="304">The gap 
between  the  official  and  the  parallel  market  rate  has  constituted  a  window  for  fraud  and

Conclusion 

63. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="421" name="421">The report shows that whereas some provisions of the R-ARCSS were implemented 
during the period under  review, overall, its critical  aspects  such as operationalization of the 
TNL to enable them to enact laws, completion of Phase I of the unification of forces, including 
operationalization  of  the  DDR  processes,  were  not  given  the  attention  they  deserve  by  the 
RTGoNU.  </a></p>
<p><a id="422" name="422">Consequently,  the  expected  changes  from  the  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS 
during the quarter did not positively impact the lives of ordinary citizens, particularly at the 
subnational level.</a></p>
<p><a id="423" name="423">It is therefore critical that the RTGoNU focuses its attention more to ensure 
effective and efficient implementation of the outstanding tasks on governance and Transitional 
Security Arrangements, as they are the bedrocks of the R-ARCSS.  
64. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="424" name="424">Furthermore,  the  RTGoNU  needs  to  take  steps  to  ensure  that  all  the  Agreement 
institutions  mechanisms  are  established,  the  necessary  institutional  reform  processes  are 
undertaken  in  a  time  fashion,  financial  and  in-kind  resources  mobilized,  and  the  permanent 
constitution-making process progresses as planned.</a></p>
<p><a id="425" name="425">With only 20 months remaining to the end 
of the Transitional Period, there is need to ensure that the outstanding tasks of the R-ARCSS 
are simultaneously implemented.</a></p>
<p><a id="426" name="426">For this to happen, it requires the requisite political will of 
the RTGoNU, continued support from the regional and international guarantors, as well as the 
goodwill and support of all involved. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="427" name="427">65. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="428" name="428">On its part and pursuant to its mandate as provided for in Chapter 7 of the R-ARCSS, 
the RJMEC will continue to monitor, evaluate, report on the status of implementation of the R-
ARCSS, as circumstances demand, intervene to break any deadlock that may emerge in the 
course of implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="429" name="429">It will regularly provide reports and briefings to the RTGoNU, the 
reconstituted TNLA, Chairperson of the IGAD Assembly of Heads of State and Government, 
Chairperson  of  the  IGAD  Council  of  Ministers,  the  Chairperson  of  the  African  Union 
Commission, the Peace and Security Council of the African Union and to the Secretary General 
of the United Nations and the Security Council of the United Nations.</a></p>
