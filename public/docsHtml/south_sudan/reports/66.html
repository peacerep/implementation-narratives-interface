1.0  Introduction

1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">KOCH is the administrative headquarters of Koch County, which is in what is
known as Northern Liech State.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">Throughout the current conflict it has
remained in the hands of the Government, and is presently under the control
of the SPLA-IO (TD).

•</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">Although KOCH itself is held by the Government, a large part of Koch County
remains under the control of the SPLA-IO (RM).

•</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">The situation in Koch County is complex.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">There have been many incidents
during the current conflict.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">In addition to conflict between the Parties, cattle
raiding and inter-tribal issues also fuel tensions in the area.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">Incident:</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">On the 24 December 2017 there was fighting at KOCH during which
it was alleged 15 people were killed and 26 wounded.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The Government
claimed this was an attack by the SPLA-IO (RM).

1.2  Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">The purpose of this report is to summarise the findings of the CTSAMM
investigation into the incident, apportion responsibility where possible and make
recommendations.

1.3  Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">On5 January 2018 the MVT based in BENTIU interviewed two SPLA-IO (RM)
soldiers who had been involved in the fighting, wounded, taken prisoner and
moved to BENTIU for medical treatment.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">On  January an MVT deployed from Juba to KOCH and met with local
Officials and people.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">On 12 January the MVT visited the SPLA-IO (RM) HQ in THONYOR where
they were given the contact details of the SPLA-IO (RM) Commissioner for
Koch County who they were then able to interview.

2.0  Findings

2.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">KOCH was attacked in the early morning of 24 December 2017, on the day the
ACOH came into effect.

2.2  The MVT spoke to the authorities in KOCH and corroborated the information they
were given by talking with a wide range of local people.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">They were told that the
attack was carried out by the SPLA-IO (RM), and that 15 people (including 
children) were killed in the attack and 26 wounded.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">The MVT did not see the
bodies because by the time of the visit they had been buried.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">It was also alleged
that 50 head of cattle were taken.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">The fighting lasted a few hours and then the
attacking forces withdrew having taken casualties.

2.3  Two wounded SPLA-IO (RM) POWs interviewed by CTSAMM both stated clearly
that this was a planned attack by the SPLA-IO (RM) with the aim of taking KOCH.
</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">Neither were proper soldiers, but rather local young men persuaded to take part
in the attack.

2.4  When the MVT spoke with the SPLA-IO (RM) County Commissioner he clearly
confirmed that his forces had attacked KOCH on 24 December.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">He claimed the
attack was in response to a raid by SPLA-affiliated youth at a place called LANG
where ,000 head of cattle were stolen.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">The MVT was unable to obtain any
information about the alleged cattle raid from other sources.

2.5  The Government authorities in KOCH also claimed that SPLA-IO (RM) forces
had attacked BUAW payam (killing  old men) on 31 December and MIRMIR on
 January.

3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">

3.1| SPLMA-IO (RM) forces did indeed attack KOCH on the morning of 24 December
2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">There was a clear admission by the SPLA-IO (RM) County Commissioner,
as well as all the other evidence.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">Civilians were killed in the attack.

3.2  The SPLA-IO (RM) carried out this attack despite the signing of the ACOH.

3.3  It is the opinion of CTSAMM that the alleged cattle raid on 23 December by
SPLA-affiliated youth does not in any way give the SPLA-IO (RM) right or reason
to violate the agreement and attack a community which has been in Government
hands throughout the current conflict.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">CTSAMM received no complaint from the
SPLA-IO (RM) about the alleged cattle raid on 23 December.

3.4  Allegations made by the Government authorities in KOCH about attacks by the
SPLA-IO (RM) in BUAW and MIRMIR remain unconfirmed.

3.5  Conclusion:</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">By attacking KOCH on 24 December 2017, SPLA-IO (RM) forces were in
clear and blatant violation of the ACOH, particularly Articles One.1, Three.2
‘All hostile military actions’ and Six.a ‘Attacks...on the civilian population..’

•</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">SPLA-IO (RM) has also failed to fulfill its obligations under Articles One and
Two to ensure that all those under its control comply with the agreement.

4.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">

5.0  It is disappointing that SPLA-IO (RM) forces carried out a blatant attack in clear
violation of the ACOH on the day it was to come into effect, and tragic that this
action led to the deaths of civilians who should have be  protected by the
agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">The alleged provocation by SPLA-affiliated youths in no way
justifies or excuses this violation.

5.1  CTSAMM calls on the SPLA-IO (RM) to ensure that all forces under their
command understand and implement the provisions of the ACOH, and asks the
IGAD Council of Ministers and JMEC to work at the political level to reinforce this
message.

5.2  In order to avoid further conflict, all Parties must ensure their forces freeze in
place and avoid any provocative actions.

5.3  CTSAMM calls on stakeholders to facilitate and the Parties to cooperate with
confidence building measures in Unity State which could lower tensions and
resolve disputes.
