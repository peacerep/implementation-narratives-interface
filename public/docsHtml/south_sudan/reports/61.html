INTERIM REPORT ON TENSION AND FIGHTING IN CENTRAL EQUATORIA

STATE FOLLOWING THE CHANGE OF ALLEGIANCE OF MAJOR GENERAL

MOSES LOKOJU

Introduction

1.</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">Following the change of allegiance of Maj Gen Moses Lokoju Gabriel (the former
commander of SPLMA-IO Division 2B) to the SSPDF the situation in the Moroto,
Ajio and Kirwa areas has become tense and violent, with at least two clashes at
Moroto Training Centre and allegations by the SPLM/A-IO that the SSPDF have
been involved in supporting the SSPDF-affiliated forces of Maj Gen Lokoju.

2.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">Following an initial attack against Moroto Training Centre on 29 September 2020
steps were taken by|JDB to stop the situation escalating, and various measures
suggested.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">However, none of these measures were implemented and tensions
continued until further fighting broke out in the area of Moroto Training Centre on
26 November 2020.

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">The issues behind the tensions and violence have not yet been resolved, and at
time of writing CTSAMVM is continuing to receive reports of fighting.

Aim

4.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">The aim of this interim report is to summarise CTSAMVM reports about incidents
so far, and to make Observations and recommendations.

Incidents — sequence of events

5. 21 September 2020
a. The SPLM/A-IO published a press statement saying that Maj Gen Moses

Lokoju had “defedted” to the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">He had reportedly been recalled to Juba
previously by the SPLM/A-IO to answer disciplinary charges.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">CTSAMVM later
received a copy of Maj Gen Lokoju’s resignation letter dated 21 September
2020.

b. The CTSAMVM MVT in Yei received unsubstantiated information that Maj Gen
Moses Lokoju had returned to the Kajo-Keji area, and was allegedly recruiting
SPLM/A-IO soldiers from the Kuku tribe to change allegiance to the SSPDF.

6. 23 September 2020;</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">CTSAMVM received unofficial allegations from the
SPLM/A-IO that trainees at Moroto Training Centre had been issued weapons in
case of attack, that Maj Gen Lokoju was recruiting members of the Kuku tribe for
the SSPDF and that/he was planning an attack on the Training Centre.

7. 24 September 2020;</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">CTSAMVM visited Moroto Training Centre, and was
informed by the Commander, Brig Gen Peter Wal Chuo! SPLM/A-IO, that the
trainees (all of whom are from the SPLM/A-IO) had not been armed.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">However, he
said the security situation was not good since the arrival in the area of Maj Gen
Lokoju who he clai      had been flown to Kajo-Keji in an SSPDF helicopter.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">He
also claimed that Maj Gen Lokujo had been supplied with  armed Land Cruisers
and escorted to Kirwa, which is not far from Moroto.  </a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">of Maj Gen Lokoju’s
soldiers had been reportedly captured whilst setting ambushes near the Training
Centre.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">28 September 2020;</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">The Commander of Moroto Training Centre reported by
telephone to CTSAMVM that there had been fighting on 27 September in Kirwa
between loyal SPLM/A-IO soldiers and those who followed Maj Gen Lokoju, and
that the SPLM/A-IO had prevailed and were in full control of the unit —  Brigade
— based in Kirwa.

<p><a id="72" name="72">Kajo-Keji
on 30 November and Moroto and Ajio on  December.</a></p>

promised to meet the team at Kajo-Keji but did not turn up and subsequent
attempts to meet him were unsuccessful.

b. The investigation team were told by the SSPDF  Brigade Deputy Commander
Col Gush Dieng at Kajo-Keji that he bemoaned the failure of the JDB to
implement a joint force to manage the situation in the area.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">He stated that
because he had defected, Maj Gen Lokoju was the responsibility of the
SSPDF, but in reality he had been left in control of a large area.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">The SSPDF 
Brigade Commander (Brig Gen Lual Deng) had given Maj Gen Lokoju a
standing order to undertake no offensive action, and that Maj Gen Lokoju
occasionally reported to the Brigade:</a></p>

November the SPLM/A-IO had attacked his forces in Kuria, looted cattle and

killed several civilians.</a></p>

few members of the guard force who had been left to watch over it.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">There
were no signs of fighting at the camp itself, although it was obvious from empty
cases, burnt tukuls and bullet holes in solar panels that there had been a
clash at the protection force position about 1.0- Km from the main camp.
</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">CTSAMVM saw no obvious signs of tracked or wheeled vehicles.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">There were
signs at the Training Centre that the trainees had left in a hurry.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">The food
store had not been emptied and personal possessions were scattered.

d.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">The trainees and instructors from the Training Centre had withdrawn to Ajio,
where the team met the Commander and a number of trainees and instructors.
</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">According to the witnesses interviewed by CTSAMVM there were two attacks
on 26 November, both directed at the protection force camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">The first was an
infantry attack at 6.0  Hrs which was beaten off, and the second was at 18.0 
Hrs supported by  APCs and  armed Land Cruisers with heavy machine
guns and RPG's.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">The second attack overran the camp but did not reach the
Training Centre itself.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">The guard force, trainees and instructors all withdrew to
Ajio The Training Site Commander, Brig Gen Peter Wal Choul made it clear
that he would not reoccupy the Training Site until a joint SSPDF/SPLM/A-lO
forces had taken responsibility for security in the area, and SSPDF-affiliated
Maj Gen Lokoju and his forces had been moved from his present location.

</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">•. On 27 November 2020 CTSAMVM received unverified allegations for the
SPLM/A-IO  Brigade commander in Panyume that Maj Gen Lokoju had
attacked Ajio and would probably go on to attack Moroto again.

</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">f. On the morning of  December 2020 CTSAMVM received information from the
SPLM/A-IO Senior National Liaison officer that the SSPDF-affiliated forces of
Maj Gen Lokoju had attacked their positions at Ajio.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">CTSAMVM received

reports from the SPLM/A-IO of further fighting on  December 2020 although
when contacted Maj Gen Lokoju denied this was the case.

g. On  December CTSAMVM met with the commander of SSPDF 1st Bde Land
Forces in Yei, Brig Gen John Lual, who said he had made arrangements with
the Deputy Commander of the SSPDF Ground Force in Kajo-Keji, Col John
Kamilo, to deploy SSPDF soldiers in Kirwa, Ajio and Mangaltori, so the forces
of Maj Gen Moses Lokujo could be moved elsewhere away from the SPLM/A-
10.

h. On -12 December 2020 CTSAMVM accompanied UNMISS on a patrol to
Morobo and Panyume.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">The plan was to proceed to from Panyume to Ajio and
Moroto, but whilst at Panyume information was received from the commander
of Moroto Training Centre (who was in Ajio) that the security situation was not
good there, and so the team postponed the visit and returned to Yei.

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">Observations and Recommendations

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">The change of allegiance of Maj Gen Lokoju has not only created tension in the
Moroto-Ajio-Kirwa area;</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">it has also led to violence and the closure of Moroto
Training Centre.

</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">17.The SSPDF are responsible for the actions of Maj Gen Lokoju, but do not appear
to have exercised any control over his forces.

18.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">The statement by the commander of SSPDF  Brigade in Yei that he has made
arrangements to deploy forces in Kirwa, Ajio and Magalatore requires urgent
clarification with JDB.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">Any movement of forces must be coordinated by JDB and
CTSAMVM informed.

19.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">JDB failed to act in a timely manner after the 29 September attack against Moroto
Training Centre.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">None of the measures described by the Minister of Defence were
implemented.

20.</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">
a. That JDB takes action to reduce tensions in the area, and confidence-building
measures are implemented as a matter of urgency.
</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">b. That JDB gives clear directions about the deployment and future of the SSPDF-
affiliated forces under control of Maj Gen Lokujo.
</a></p>
