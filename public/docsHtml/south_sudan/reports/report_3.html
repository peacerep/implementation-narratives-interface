Executive Summary 

1.  </a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">This Report which covers the period from April 1st to June 30th, 2018 updates the High Level 
Revitalization  Forum  (HLRF)  while  at  the  same  time  highlighting  the  prevailing  political, 
security, humanitarian and economic situation in the Republic of South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">In addition it 
presents  a  series  of  observations  and  make  recommendations  to  address  some  of  the 
shortcomings to date in the implementation process.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">2.  </a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">In May 2018 the second phase of the HLRF was reconvened and facilitated by the South Sudan 
Council of Churches (SSCC), with secretariat support from Civil Society and women groups. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">However the parties failed to compromise on most of the outstanding governance and security 
issues.  </a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">Following  this  the  IGAD  Facilitation  Team  developed  bridging  proposals  on  the 
outstanding issues for the parties to consider.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">These were ultimately rejected by the parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">3.  </a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">In late June,  IGAD leaders held  two consecutive meetings on South  Sudan in  Addis Ababa, 
Ethiopia  –  the  62nd  Extra-Ordinary  Session  of  the  IGAD  Council  of  Ministers  and  the  32nd 
Extra-Ordinary  Summit  of  the  IGAD  Assembly  of  Heads  of  State  and  Government.    </a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">The 
Council authorised another round of intensive consultations including a face-to-face meeting 
between H.E Salva Kiir and H.E Dr Riek Machar facilitated by H.E Dr Abiy Ahmed,  IGAD 
Chairperson and Prime Minister of Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">4.  </a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">The Summit also mandated President Omar Hassan Al-Bashir to facilitate a second round of 
the meeting between President Salva Kiir Mayardit and Dr Riek Machar Teny in Khartoum, 
including other South  Sudanese parties to  build  on the Addis Ababa process.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">Following this 
Kenyan  president  H.E  Uhuru  Kenyatta  would  facilitate  a  further  round  of  the  face-to-face 
meeting in Nairobi and report the outcome and way forward to the upcoming Ordinary Session 
of the IGAD Assembly of Heads of State and Government. 
 

5.  </a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">The Khartoum Declaration resulting from the first round of talks in which among other things 
the parties agreed that:</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">(</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">i) a Permanent Ceasefire would take effect after 72 hours of signing (ii) 
the transitional security arrangements adopted should aim at building an inclusive national army 
and other organized forces;</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">(iii) discussions on the outstanding issues in the  IGAD Bridging 
Proposal be concluded during the current rounds of talks;</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">and (iv) the oil fields in Unity State 
would be rehabilitated.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">This Permanent Ceasefire has since been reportedly violated. 
 

6.  </a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">Concerning Chapter I the parties during the HLRF process agreed and initialed the following:</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">
</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">(i) a transitional period of thirty-six (36) months preceded by 120 days Pre-Transitional Period;</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">
</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">(ii)  the  Mandate  of  the  revitalized  transitional  government;</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70"> </a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">(iii)  Judicial  reform;</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72"> </a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">(iv)  Pre-
Transitional tasks and mandate of the National Constitutional Amendment Committee (NCAC);</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">(v) The restructuring and reconstitution of all transitional Institutions and Mechanisms;</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">and (vi) 
National Elections at the end of the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">7.  </a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">The NCAC during this period finalized the review and amendment of the Political Parties Act, 
2012  and  the  National  Elections  Act,  2012.  </a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">Consistent  with  the  dictates  of  the  ARCSS  the 
NCAC  has  begun  the  development  of  the  necessary  legal  framework  for  the  Economic  and 
Financial Management Authority (EFMA).  </a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">Establishment of the EFMA is expected to provide 
a good oversight and monitoring mechanism for the South Sudanese economy.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">8.  </a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">Consistent  access  to  civilian  populations  in  need  of  emergency  humanitarian  assistance  and 
protection  remains  problematic  and  displacements  continue  with  almost  4.2  million  people 

 

4 

forced out of their homes, of which 2.5 million are taking refuge in neighbouring countries.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">At 
the same time food insecurity is widespread with over 7 million people severely food insecure. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">Despite the huge humanitarian needs, provision of assistance remains difficult due to not only 
the ongoing rainy season, but also on account of the continued violations of the Peace Agreement 
and the CoHA. 
 

9.  </a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">Since the start of the conflict in 2013 the South Sudanese economy has been in a state of decline 
and  scant  improvement  has  been  seen  in  the  period  under  review.  </a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">In  the  recent  past  more 
favorable  world  oil  prices  have  contributed  to  a  better  outlook  in  the  oil  sector.  </a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">This  recent 
development  notwithstanding  the  fiscal  situation  remains  bleak  with  mounting  salary  arrear 
payments owed to public workers and the military.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">Also, this provides limited scope for peace 
expenditures envisaged under the Peace Agreement.  
 

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">The  Ministry  of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Affairs  with  the  partnership  of  the  UNDP  and 
relevant stakeholders has commenced activities to form part of the proposed nationwide process 
intended  to  illicit  views of  those  affected  by  the  conflict to  inform  the  content  of  the 
Commission on Truth and Reconciliation (CTRH).</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">11.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">The JMEC leadership continued to engage with both Regional guarantors and the international 
partners’  community  in  the  fulfilment  of  its  mandate.  </a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">On  February  6th  2018  JMEC  held  a 
briefing of donor partners on the HLRF status, progress and implications to the JMEC mandate 
and operation.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">It created awareness on JMEC’s critical role in the revitalization process, updated 
partners on progress made and unveiled a roadmap towards its successful conclusion as well as 
implication to JMEC both financially and in terms of strategy going forward. 
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">12.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">Continued violations of the CoHA particularly in the context of the renewed peace efforts must 
stop.  </a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">At  the  same  time  the  IGAD  Council  of  Ministers  must  hold  to  account  spoilers  and 
violators of the agreement and impose the necessary punitive sanctions to ensure compliance. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">No  one  should  be  allowed  to  violate  the  agreement  with  impunity.  </a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">To  this  end,  JMEC 
recommends  the  formation  of  a  high  level  consultative  mechanism  comprised  of  Regional 
guarantors,  the  AU  adhoc  committee  on  South  Sudan,  and  the  UN.  </a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">This  mechanism  will 
periodically  review  the  implementation  of  the  Peace  Agreement  with  the  objective  of 
formulating  and  taking  timely  and  decisive  action  against  spoilers  and  violators  of  the 
agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">13.</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">JMEC also urges the relevant national criminal justice institutions to investigate and prosecute 
those responsible for the spate of violations reported by CTSAMM, the Commission for Human 
Rights  for  South  Sudan  and  UNMISS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">TGoNU  bears  the  primary  responsibility  for  the 
protection of civilians and for preventing future violations by holding perpetrators accountable 
under domestic laws.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">The unconscionable delay in the establishment of chapter 5 mechanisms 
does not exempt TGoNU from its obligations under domestic and international law.</a></p>

Overview 

2.  </a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">The HLRF derives its mandate from the 31st Extra-Ordinary Summit of the Assembly of IGAD 
Heads of State and Government and the IGAD Council of Ministers decisions.  </a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">Over the past 
year,  IGAD  has  convened  two  Summits,  six  Extra-Ordinary  Sessions  and  three  side-line 
meetings on South Sudan specifically related to revitalization.</a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">3.  </a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">On  June  12th    2017  the  IGAD  Summit  made  a  decision  to  urgently  convene  a  HLRF  of  the 
Parties  to  the  ARCSS  and  estranged  groups  to  discuss  concrete  measures  to:</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121"> </a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">a)  restore  a 
permanent ceasefire;</a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">b) full and inclusive implementation of the Peace Agreement;</a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">and c) to 
develop revised and realistic timelines and an implementation schedule towards a democratic 
election at the end of the transitional period.</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">The decision followed the recommendation by the 
Chairperson of the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC) to this Summit for 
consideration to revitalize the ARCSS in order to restore its full and inclusive implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">

 

4.  </a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">By  end-March  2018,  two  rounds  of  HLRF  had  already  been  conducted,  with  the  first  round 
launched  on  December  18th  2017,  lasting  five  days.  </a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">The  Agreement  on  the  Cessation  of 
Hostilities, Protection of Civilians and Humanitarian Access (CoHA) signed on 21st December 
2017  by  the  parties  and  stakeholders  was  a  significant  milestone  at  this  phase  of  the 
revitalization process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="129" name="129">The subsequent HLRF session from February 5th – 16th  2018, deliberated 
on  the  Declaration  of  Principles,  governance  and  transitional  security  arrangements.  </a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">Some 
achievements were also made at this phase of the Forum with the parties initialing a number of 
the  provisions  of  chapters  I  and  II  of  the  ARCSS  on  governance  and  security.  </a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">Despite  this 
progress,  outstanding  issues  on  governance  and  security  arrangements1  remained  to  be 
deliberated upon during later rounds of negotiations.</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132"> 

                                                           

</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">1 These outstanding issues were highlighted in the previous Quarterly Report.</a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">The outstanding governance issues 
pertained to the structure and composition of transitional government, responsibility sharing, number of States, 
size and composition of transitional national legislature.  </a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">On security arrangements, there remained outstanding 
issues on the process and timelines for the unification of forces and approach to the formation of one national 
army, security of Juba;</a></p>
<p><a id="136" name="136">cantonment of forces;</a></p>
<p><a id="137" name="137">demilitarization of civilian centers;</a></p>

compromises.</a></p>
<p><a id="156" name="156">Consequently, the Council conducted the shuttle diplomacy with support from

did not compromise on the outstanding governance and security issues. 
 

9.  </a></p>
<p><a id="167" name="167">The Council’s efforts to narrow the gaps in the positions of the parties did not yield the necessary 
compromises between the parties on the outstanding governance and security issues.</a></p>
<p><a id="168" name="168">The parties 
acknowledged  the  persistence  of  these  gaps  and  requested  the  IGAD  Mediation  Team  to 
develop bridging proposals for them to consider.

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="170" name="170">Following the intra-South Sudanese dialogue, the IGAD Facilitation Team developed a set of 
bridging proposals on the outstanding governance and transitional security arrangements.</a></p>
<p><a id="171" name="171">They 
were  intended  to  identify  common  ground  between  the  parties  negotiating  positions.</a></p>
<p><a id="172" name="172"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="173" name="173">Subsequently  the  parties  submitted  written  responses  to  those  proposals  reflecting  their 
positions.</a></p>
<p><a id="174" name="174">Based on these submissions the Mediation Team revised the bridging proposals and 
submitted it to the IGAD Council of Ministers.</a></p>
<p><a id="175" name="175">The proposals were subsequently endorsed by 
the Council at its 62nd Extra-Ordinary Session held on May 31st 2018.

<p><a id="239" name="239">The  development  of  the  necessary  legal  framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial 
Management Authority (EFMA) in accordance with the Peace Agreement, is also the mandate

<p><a id="240" name="240">During this period, the NCAC began initial consultations on the development of 
a legislative framework for its establishment.</a></p>
<p><a id="241" name="241">This included several meetings with the JMEC

Review Commission to assess the current status of laws reviewed/amended by TGoNU under

have a consequential effect on other laws in this sector.

groups operate.

<p><a id="324" name="324">Undoubtedly the humanitarian situation remains dire.</a></p>
<p><a id="325" name="325">According  to the United Nations Office 
for  the  Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs  ( U N O C H A ) , 4.2 million people remain 
displaced,  2.5  million  in  neighbouring  countries  and  almost  1.7  million  internally.  </a></p>

remaining in the country, 7 million people need humanitarian assistance and 7.1 million people 
are estimated to be severely food insecure.</a></p>
<p><a id="327" name="327">With the ongoing conflict and the deteriorating 
economy,  food  insecurity  is  likely  to  persist  due  to  increased  displacement,  disruption  of 
markets and supply routes leading to increased prices, and hampering of livelihood activities, 
especially food production.</a></p>

Chapter IV - Resource, Economic and Financial Management 

42.</a></p>
<p><a id="335" name="335">Since the start of the conflict in 2013 the South Sudanese economy has been in a state of decline 
and scant improvement has been seen in the period under review.</a></p>
<p><a id="336" name="336">At end-March annual inflation 
persisted at 80 percent.</a></p>
<p><a id="337" name="337">Measures implemented by the authorities to help stem the steady decline 
in  the exchange rate have met with  limited success.</a></p>
<p><a id="338" name="338">The deterioration persists  but  at a much 
slower rate compared to the steep decline during the first quarter.</a></p>
<p><a id="339" name="339">Ultimately the exchange rate 

 

14 

level will be determined by the availability of foreign currency in the market.</a></p>
<p><a id="340" name="340">To keep inflation 
in check it is imperative to moderate the decline in the exchange rate. 
 

43.</a></p>
<p><a id="341" name="341">In the recent past more favorable world oil prices has contributed to the authorities efforts to 
pay down arrears due to the government of Sudan under the Oil Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="342" name="342">It is expected that 
the  arrears  will  be  cleared  by  end-August  2018.  </a></p>
<p><a id="343" name="343">The  repayment  had  previously  placed  a 
tremendous burden on the government’s ability to meet its other spending obligations.</a></p>
<p><a id="344" name="344">With the 
revised payment date there is an expectation that the authorities will command a much better 
cash flow situation.</a></p>
<p><a id="345" name="345">This recent development notwithstanding the fiscal situation remains bleak 
with mounting salary arrear payments owed to public workers and the military, and with limited 
scope for peace expenditures envisaged under the Peace Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="346" name="346"> 

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="347" name="347">44.</a></p>
<p><a id="348" name="348">During the period under review the authorities demonstrated a renewed commitment to unwind 
the fuel oil subsidy formally including it into the budget measures for the new fiscal year.</a></p>
<p><a id="349" name="349">This 
combined  with  ongoing  efforts  at  mobilising  revenue  collection  by  the  recently  established 
Revenue Authority will help to some extent to improve the country’s fiscal outlook.</a></p>
<p><a id="350" name="350">However 
much remains to be done with respect to expenditure reorientation away from military spending 
and towards sectors of the economy that can spur and generate economic growth.</a></p>
<p><a id="351" name="351">Consequently, 
there is need to press ahead with urgently needed public finance reforms. 

 

45.</a></p>
<p><a id="352" name="352">With  regards  to  the  overall  implementation  of  Chapter  IV,  insufficient  resources,  failure  to 
update  key  legislation,  and  in  some  cases  a  lack  of  political  will  have  severely  constrained 
progress.  </a></p>
<p><a id="353" name="353">Further,  key  support  structures  like  the  Anti-Corruption  Commission  and  the 
Economic  and  Financial  Management  Authority  (EFMA)  has  so  far  been  largely  ignored. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="354" name="354">However, work has started on developing the legislative framework for the setting up of the 
EFMA.  </a></p>
<p><a id="355" name="355">When  operationalised  this  organization  is  expected  to  provide  a  basis  for  better 
monitoring and oversight of the South Sudanese economy.</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="357" name="357">Economic Outlook 

46.</a></p>
<p><a id="358" name="358">In the absence of a comprehensive peace it is difficult to envisage much progress with regards 
to economic growth and development.</a></p>
<p><a id="359" name="359">The economy of South Sudan and ultimately its people 
can  only  truly  begin  to  experience  meaningful  development  in  the  absence  of  war  and  in  a 
focused  effort  to  increase  the  share  of  capital  expenditure,  stimulate  agriculture  production, 
mobilise oil and other revenue sources, and expand the private sector’s role in development.  
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="360" name="360">47.</a></p>
<p><a id="361" name="361">High inflation levels, deterioration of the exchange rate, and ballooning fiscal deficits continue 
to serve as major threats to the economic stability of the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="362" name="362">Unless efforts are focused on 
improving  expenditure  management,  enacting  appropriate  legislation,  and  further  improving 
revenue  collection  the  economy  will  continue  to  face  severe  challenges  in  economic 
stabilisation and setting the stage for future growth.  </a></p>
<p><a id="363" name="363">Finally, implementation of Chapter IV of 
the  Peace  Agreement  will  need  to  be  sped  up  in  order  to  strengthen  the  economic  policy 
framework, and set the basis for sustained growth.

<p><a id="470" name="470">The people of South Sudan continue to demand a complete end to hostilities, and a lasting and 
permanent  peace.  </a></p>
<p><a id="471" name="471">There  is  extreme  weariness  with  the  desolate  humanitarian  situation, 
egregious  violations  of  human  rights  and  a  depressed  economy.  </a></p>
<p><a id="472" name="472">Undoubtedly  the  people  of 
South Sudan look to the parties of the latest signed provisions implemented in letter and spirit, 
and push ahead with the realization of durable peace.</a></p>
<p><a id="473" name="473">There must be a renewed commitment 
from all stakeholders to adhere to the CoHA and to fully implement the revised ARCSS.

<p><a id="474" name="474">The  NCAC  will  continue  to  execute  its  mandate  of  facilitating  the  necessary  legislative  and 
legal  framework  during  the  Transition  Period  to  result  in  free  and  fair  elections.  </a></p>
<p><a id="475" name="475">Similarly 
CTSAMM will continue with  its monitoring, verification and reporting activities in  a timely 
fashion in order for IGAD to take necessary action when required.

<p><a id="476" name="476">JMEC on its part shall continue to monitor, evaluate and carry out its oversight responsibilities 
with regards to the ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="477" name="477">It will also report regularly in writing to the TGoNU, the TNLA, 
the  Chairperson  of  the  IGAD  Council  of  Ministers,  the  Chairperson  of  the  African  Union 
Commission,  the  Peace  and  Security  Council  of  the  AU,  and  to  the  Secretary  General  and
