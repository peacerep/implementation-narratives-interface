Executive Summary 

</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">This  Report  on  the  status  of  implementation  of  the  Pre-Transitional  tasks  of  the  Revitalised 
Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict  in  the Republic of South  Sudan (R-ARCSS) is 
prepared pursuant to Chapter VII, Article 7.9 of the R-ARCSS and covers the period 1st October 
to 31st December 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">Highlighted in the report are important meetings that took place aimed 
at adding impetus to the nearly stalled R-ARCSS implementation process including that of the 
IGAD  Heads  of  State  and  Government,  the  IGAD  Council  of  Ministers,  Parties  to  the 
Agreement and the African Union Peace and Security Council. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">Ultimately  the  IGAD  consultations  resulted  in  the  agreement  to  extend  the  Pre-Transitional 
Period by an additional 100 days  from 12th November 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">This decision was based on the 
non-resolution of critical outstanding issues relating mainly to the determination of the number 
of states and their boundaries;</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">and the screening, training and redeployment of at least 83 000 
Necessary Unified Forces (NUF). 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">The Permanent Ceasefire between the signatories of the R-ARCSS held throughout the period 
under review, underscoring their commitment to the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">However, the long-simmering 
tension between clans of the Lou Nuer in the Maiwut region of Upper Nile developed into open 
conflict  following  the  defection  of  the  former  SPLA-IO  General  James  Ochan  to  the  South 
Sudan Peoples Defense Forces (SSPDF).</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">Of some concern is the continuing occupation of 24 
civilian  centres  of  which  23  is  by  the  SSPDF  and  1  by  the  SPLM/A-IO,  and  the  seeming 
indifference to rectify this violation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">As the Permanent Ceasefire continues to hold, there has been a notable increase in freedom of 
movement, which has prompted the voluntary returns of IDPs and refugees back to their homes. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">UNMISS  has  reported  the  return  of  over  600  000  IDPs  since  the  signing  of  the  R-ARCSS. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">However, concern is being expressed by members of the international  community, about the 
need by all Parties to the Agreement to guarantee the continued protection of civilians.  </a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">There 
were attacks on NGO staff in Morobo County, Yei River State in which three (3) aid workers 
were  killed.  </a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">Also,  serious  clashes  broke  out  between  the  Gak  and  Manuer  communities  in 
Jonglei, resulting in fatalities and serious injuries to civilian personnel.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">Concerning the economy, the exchange rate weakened markedly through the 2018/19 fiscal year 
largely driving price developments with annual inflation reaching 170 per cent in October 2019 
before falling to 70 percent in December 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">The weakened and volatile exchange rate and 
the  ensuing  inflation  performance  have  impacted  market  conditions  negatively  by  creating 
uncertainty and risks for producers, traders and consumers.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">At the same time, oil production has 
stabilised at around 170 000 to 180 000 barrels per day with the world oil price about 10 percent 
above that projected in the country’s budget. 
 

 

  
 </a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">iii 

On the number of States and their boundaries, several political initiatives with the Parties to the 
Agreement  were  undertaken  following  the  recommendations  of  the  Independent  Boundaries 
Commission  (IBC)  to  the  IGAD  Executive  Secretary  as  well  as  the  decision  of  the  IGAD 
Council of Ministers.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">In December, H.E. David Mabuza, the Deputy President of South Africa 
engaged the Parties in direct talks in an attempt to reach consensus.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">The consultations ended 
without an agreement and it was agreed that discussions would continue in the weeks ahead. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">On the critical issue of the registration, screening, selection, training and redeployment of the 
NUF a total of 76,160 personnel were registered in the10 barracks (SSPDF) and 25 cantonment 
sites (SPLM/A-IO and SSOA).</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">Of this number approximately 16 000 are SSPDF and 60 000 
SPLA-IO  and  SSOA  forces.  </a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">Beyond  the  registration,  however,  not  much  more  was 
accomplished.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">One of the main contributory factors was the late disbursement of resources to 
the  security  mechanisms.  </a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">Even  then,  the  amount  of  US  $15.1  million  they  received  was 
substantially  less  than  that  previously  budgeted  and  deemed  needed  to  complete  the  process 
during the 100 days extension.    
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">With  regards  to  the  other  outstanding  Pre-Transitional  tasks,  the  Parties  should  pay  close 
attention to the submission of their TNLA representatives’ nominees to the NCAC in a timely 
manner.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">With less than two months to go before the scheduled formation of the R-TGONUthe 
process  should  already be well underway.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">At the same time, the  government should quickly 
enact the Constitutional Amendment Bill and the other laws previously reviewed by the NCAC. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">This is important in facilitating a smooth transition to the formation of the R-TGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">Finally, 
the SDSR Board must work to complete the Strategic Security Assessment while developing 
the security policy framework and conducting an analysis of the operational capabilities of the 
national army and security forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">The  RJMEC  leadership  in  carrying  out  its  mandate  continued  to  effectively  engage  key 
stakeholders  on  the  pace  and  status  of  implementation  of  the  Pre-Transitional  tasks  still 
outstanding.  </a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">This  included  briefing  consultations  with  the  Executive  Secretary  of  IGAD, 
separate  consultations  with  the  Parties  to  the  Agreement,  the  Stakeholders  and  the  Regional 
guarantors and diplomatic community, the Africa Union Peace and Security Council (AUPSC), 
and meetings with H.E. Salva Kiir Mayardit, President of the Republic of South Sudan and Dr. 
Riek Machar, Chairperson of the SPLM/A-IO.

Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict  in  the Republic of South  Sudan (R-ARCSS) is 
prepared pursuant to Chapter VII, Article 7.9 of the R-ARCSS and covers the period 1st October 
to 31st December 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">It builds on the previous four quarterly reports, numbers 001/19, 002/19, 
003/19 and 003/19.1 
 

2.  </a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">Highlighted in the report are important meetings that took place aimed at adding impetus to the 
nearly stalled R-ARCSS implementation  process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">These include:</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78"> </a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">the meeting of the regional 
and international  Special Envoys  to  South  Sudan held  in  Djibouti  on 25th October 2019;</a></p>

<p><a id="81" name="81">the 
Tripartite meeting convened by H.E. Yoweri Museveni, President of the Republic of Uganda 
and attended by H.E. Salva Kiir Mayardit, President of the Republic of South Sudan, H.E. Abdel 
Fatah  al  Burhan,  President  of  the  Transitional  Sovereign  Council  of  Sudan,  H.E.  Stephen 
Kalonzo  Musyoka,  the  Kenya  Special  Envoy  to  South  Sudan,  and  Dr.  Riek  Machar  the 
Chairperson of the SPLM/A-IO held in Entebbe, Uganda on 7th November 2019;</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">a consultative

<p><a id="84" name="84">the  Council  of  Ministers  meeting  held  on  10th 
November 2019;</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">the RJMEC briefings to the African Union Peace and Security Council on the 
15th  of  October  2019  and  14th  November  2019,  and  the  13th  Ordinary  Summit  of  the 
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) Heads of State and Government held on 
29th November 2019. 
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">3.   </a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">The IGAD consultations resulted in the agreement to extend the Pre-Transitional Period by an 
additional 100 days from 12th November 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">This decision was based on the non-resolution 
of critical outstanding issues relating mainly to the determination of the number of states and

<p><a id="90" name="90">and  the  screening,  training  and  redeployment  of  at  least  83  000  Necessary 
Unified  Forces  (NUF).  </a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">There  was  agreement  by  the  Parties  that  failure  to  make  meaningful 
progress on these two critical issues was sufficient grounds for delaying the formation of the 
Revitalised Transitional Government of National Unity (RTGoNU).</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">

 
4.  </a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">Although the Parties committed to resolving the outstanding critical issues when agreeing to the 
100-day  extension,  the  fourth  quarter  ended  without  any  agreement  on  the  number  and 
boundaries  of  states.  </a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">Further,  very  little  progress  was  made  in  advancing  the  security 
arrangements related to the screening, training and redeployment of the NUF.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">The above tasks 
formed part of the ten (10) activities out of sixty-three (63) outlined in the R-ARCSS, which 
were to be implemented during the Pre-Transitional Period and which still remained outstanding 
during the fourth quarter.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">At the same time, thirty-one (31) activities are completed, and twenty-
two (22) are ongoing.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">

Political Developments 

6.  </a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">The political environment in the country remained generally calm.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">Nonetheless, some Parties 
to  the  Agreement  had  intra-party  leadership  tensions,  which  spilled  over  from  the  previous 
reporting periods.  </a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">Notably, the South Sudan Opposition Alliance (SSOA) is divided into two 
factions  with  each  claiming  legitimacy  of  the  leadership  of  the  Alliance.  </a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">Also,  the  Other 
Political Parties (OPP) experienced some leadership challenges.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">Individual parties within the 
OPP  observed  that  they  did  not  have  a  formal  memorandum  to  govern  their  inter-party 
relationships.  </a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">The  South  Sudan  Council  of  Churches  and  the  IGAD  Special  Envoy  Office 
engaged  the  concerned  parties  in  attempts  to  resolve  their  political  differences.  </a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">Also,  the 
RJMEC  leadership  regularly  engaged  with  the  Parties  to  the  Agreement  through  formal 
processes as part of regular consultations as well as to address some of their concerns. 
 

7.  </a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">In line with the principles of complementarity and subsidiarity with the IGAD regional bloc on 
South Sudan peace process, there were a series of diplomatic engagements with the country to 
show  solidarity  with  the  people  of  South  Sudan  as  well  as  to  encourage  the  Parties  to  fully 
implement the tasks of the Pre-Transitional period of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">High-level visits to Juba 
were  undertaken  by  the  IGAD  Council  of  Ministers,  the  African  Union  High-Level  Ad  hoc 
Committee  on  South  Sudan  (AU-C5)  and  the  African  Union  Peace  and  Security  Council 
(AUPSC) in November 2019;</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">and the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on 20th October 
2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">These visits provided diplomatic pressure aimed at encouraging the Parties to expedite 
the implementation of the R-ARCSS in order to facilitate the timely formation of the RTGoNU. 

 

8.  </a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">The AUPSC held its 886th and 894th meetings, which were on the situation in South Sudan on 
15th  October and 14th  November 2019 respectively, while the IGAD Council of Ministers held 
its 69th Extra-ordinary Session on matters pertaining to the implementation of the R-ARCSS on 
10th November 2019 and the 13th Ordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government on 29th 
November 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">These meetings arrived at several decisions, including recommending action 
that would bolster the implementation of the Pre-Transitional tasks of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">Specific 
appeal was made to the Parties to the Agreement to expeditiously complete the implementation 
of  the  outstanding  tasks  of  the  Pre-Transition  including  resolving  the  issue  pertaining  to  the 
number  of  states  and  their  boundaries.  </a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">Left  unresolved  is  the  appointment  of  a  substantive 
chairperson of RJMEC, and for the IGAD Summit to make the final determination on the status 
of Dr. Riek Machar, the Chairperson and Commander-in-Chief of the SPLM/A-IO.

9.  </a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">Following up on the recommendations of the RJMEC leadership, IGAD facilitated a face-to-
face meeting between President Salva Kiir Mayardit and Dr. Riek Machar, including with the 
Parties to the Agreement as well as other stakeholders in Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">Such meetings were viewed as 
critical  for  enhancing  confidence  and  trust  amongst  the  leadership  of  the  Parties  to  the 
Agreement, as well as in providing the necessary political guidance in addressing outstanding 
issues on transitional security arrangements and governance provisions of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">The Security Situation 

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">The Permanent Ceasefire between the signatories of the R-ARCSS held throughout the period 
under  review,  which  is  encouraging  and  positive  and  underscores  their  commitment  to  the 
Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">However, the long-simmering tension between clans of the Lou Nuer in the Maiwut 
region of Upper Nile developed into open conflict following the defection of the former SPLA-
IO  General  James  Ochan  to  the  South  Sudan  Peoples  Defense  Forces  (SSPDF).  </a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">The  most 
serious incident to date was a clash between Ochan’s forces and the SPLA-IO along the Sobat 
River on 10th December 2019, which left 4 dead and 10 wounded.</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">

 

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">The Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring and Verification Mechanism 
(CTSAMVM) continue their investigation into this and other incidents and have met with both 
leaders.</a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">This situation has the potential to escalate and affect a wider area of the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">R-
JMEC, CTSAMVM and the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) have visited 
the area and seen evidence that the SSPDF have re-equipped Ochan’s forces with new uniforms, 
originally donated by the Ethiopian Government for the NUF, and with new 7.62mm and 40mm 
ammunition.</a></p>
<p><a id="129" name="129">SSPDF remain silent on their relationship to Ochan, despite urging from RJMEC 
and CTSAMVM to restrain Ochan.</a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">As at this Report, Ochan’s forces remain camped in Turu 
cantonment site close to the town of Maiwut and the SPLA-IO forces under command of MG 
James Kour are concentrated around the town of Jekou.</a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">

</a></p>
<p><a id="263" name="263">36.</a></p>
<p><a id="264" name="264">Further, registration had stalled due to a shortage of registration forms at the sites and a lack of 
funds  to  implement  the  process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="265" name="265">More  encouraging  is  the  fact  that  cantonment  sites  have

communities.</a></p>
<p><a id="266" name="266">An increase in the number of families locating in or close to cantonment sites has 
become apparent  over the past  few months due principally to  dependents  seeking  safety  and 
security.</a></p>

have not been made by the NPTC/JMCC for families.</a></p>

Stakeholders and the Regional guarantors and diplomatic community, the Africa Union Peace 
and  Security  Council  (AUPSC)17,  and  held  meetings  with  H.E.  Salva  Kiir  Mayardit,  the 
President of the Republic of South Sudan and Dr. Riek Machar Chairperson of the SPLM/A-

<p><a id="393" name="393">The briefing update to the AUPSC was held in Juba on 15th October and was focused on the status of 
implementation of the RARCSS, and ways in which it could assist in moving the process forward.

<p><a id="394" name="394">Before  briefing  the  Executive  Secretary  of  IGAD  in  Addis  Ababa,  the  RJMEC  Interim 
Chairman wrote to the Chairman of the IGAD Heads of State the Prime Minister of Ethiopia 
with a detailed update on the status of implementation of the RARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="395" name="395">The RJMEC Interim 
Chair also requested that IGAD move quickly to prevail upon the Parties to fully implement the 
outstanding Pre-Transitional tasks.</a></p>
<p><a id="396" name="396">At the meeting with the Chairperson of the IGAD Council 
of Ministers, the RJMEC Chairman reiterated his request that IGAD more proactively engages 
the  leadership  of  the  Parties  in  efforts  to  resolve  their  outstanding  issues  related  to 
implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="397" name="397">As a follow-up to RJMEC’s engagement and acting on its recommendation the 
foreign ministers from the Region travelled to Juba in October to engage the Parties on ways in 
which implementation could be speeded up. 
 

51.</a></p>
<p><a id="398" name="398">The RJMEC Leadership met with President Silva Kiir Mayardit to update him on the status of 
implementation of the Agreement and to encourage him to use his leadership to resolve the issue 
of the states and boundaries and also to avail resources in order to complete the Pre-Transitional 
tasks, particularly that related to funding for the security arrangements.</a></p>
<p><a id="399" name="399">The President reiterated 
his full political commitment to the R-ARCSS declaring that going back to war was simply not 
an option.</a></p>
<p><a id="400" name="400">He also indicated that additional resources would be made available shortly to the 
security mechanisms and that he was in the process of convening a meeting of the Parties to 
examine and attempt to resolve the outstanding issues pertaining to the Pre-Transitional period.  

 

52.</a></p>
<p><a id="401" name="401">The RJMEC Chairperson on several occasion engaged Dr. Riek Machar.</a></p>
<p><a id="402" name="402">During these meetings, 
the  Interim  Chairperson  discussed  on  how  best  to  implement  the  critical  pending  tasks 
particularly the resolution of the number of states and the security arrangements.</a></p>
<p><a id="403" name="403">The Interim 
Chairperson also appealed to Dr. Machar on the need to engage regularly at a leadership level 
to  unlock  some  of  the  outstanding  issues  in  implementation  and  also  to  build  on  trust  and 
confidence amongst the parties.</a></p>

<p><a id="406" name="406">The RJMEC staff visited a number of cantonment sites, which were aimed at observing first-
hand the conditions at the sites and also to solicit feedback from the former combatants.</a></p>
<p><a id="407" name="407">This 
was also an opportunity to explore reports that child soldiers were registering at the cantonment 
sites.</a></p>
<p><a id="408" name="408">It was evident from the visits that there was an acute shortage of food and medicines and 
that former combatants are allowed to keep their weapons upon registration.</a></p>

<p><a id="411" name="411">During this review period in mid-December 2019, RJMEC participated in legal drafting session 
with  the Office of the  Legal  Counsel  of the Africa Union Commission.</a></p>
<p><a id="412" name="412">The drafting session 
held in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, sought to improve the zero draft Statute of the Hybrid Court 
on South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="413" name="413">The Africa Union Commission is mandated to establish the Hybrid Court in 
concert with the Reconstituted TGoNU under Chapter V of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="414" name="414">RJMEC’s role in 
this drafting session was primarily to  ensure actors adhere to  the R-ARCSS and particularly 
Chapter V on Transitional Justice, Accountability, Healing and Reconciliation when drafting 
the Statute on the Hybrid Court on South Sudan.</a></p>

<p><a id="416" name="416">During this reporting period in mid-December 2019, RJMEC participated in a conference on 
Transitional  Justice  and  the  Promotion  of  Peace  in  South  Sudan  in  Addis  Ababa,  Ethiopia 
convened by the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="417" name="417">The meeting was enriched by 
the participation of Paulino Wanawilla, Minister for Justice and Chair of the Commission and 
a  good  mix  of  state  and  non-state  actors.  </a></p>
<p><a id="418" name="418">The  meeting  set  out  a  broad  transitional  justice, 
reconciliation  and  peace  agenda  for  South  Sudan  with  both  state  and  non-state  actors 
committing  to  the  implementation  of  Chapter  V  of  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="419" name="419">This  relates  to  Transitional 
Justice,  Accountability,  Reconciliation  and  Healing.  </a></p>
<p><a id="420" name="420">RJMEC  was  requested  to  establish  a 
coordination group on transitional justice, which is expected to enhance collaboration between 
state,  non-state  and  international  actors,  in  a  quest  to  enable  coordinated  implementation  of 
Chapter V of R-ARCSS.</a></p>

to  distributing  copies  of  the  Agreement  in  South  Sudan.  </a></p>
<p><a id="424" name="424">It  reports  that  some  160,000 
publications  have  been  distributed  in  seven  languages  (whether  full  agreements  or  the 
summarised version) to a wide range of actors, including:</a></p>
<p><a id="425" name="425">those listed in Article 7.2 of the R-

<p><a id="432" name="432">academic, faith-based leaders, members of the media;</a></p>
<p><a id="433" name="433">and through direct 
JMEC outreach, such as events held in Juba, Maridi, Torit, Malakal, Wau, and Yambio. 

 

57.</a></p>
<p><a id="434" name="434">Furthermore,  there  has  been  collaboration  with  various  organisations  to  hold  outreach 
workshops  on  the  agreement,  including  with  UNMISS,  the  NPTC  dissemination  unit,  faith-
based leaders, school teachers and civil society actors.</a></p>
<p><a id="435" name="435">More specifically, they were:</a></p>
<p><a id="436" name="436">a) a two-

teachers in Juba;</a></p>

<p><a id="439" name="439">and  c)  the  third  in  the  outdoor  series  event- 
“neighbourhood  advocacy  for  peace”  at  Konyo  Konyo.  </a></p>
<p><a id="440" name="440">In  general,  these  workshops  have 
focussed  on  providing  an  orientation  on  the  contents  of  the  R-ARCSS  as  well  as  giving  the 
participants a platform to discuss ways in which they can engage in the peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="441" name="441">During 
all  RJMEC  outreach  activities,  the  Communications  Office  invited  members  of  local  media

<p><a id="442" name="442">VI.   </a></p>
<p><a id="443" name="443">Observations and Recommendations 

58.  </a></p>
<p><a id="444" name="444">Very little progress was made during the fourth quarter in addressing the two critical issues, 
which have led to the delay in the formation of the R-TGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="445" name="445">On the issue of determining the 
number and boundaries of States, the Parties have failed to reach consensus to date.</a></p>
<p><a id="446" name="446">Given the 
importance  placed  on  reaching  an  amicable  solution  to  this  issue,  the  Parties  are  urged  to 
continue  to  negotiate  in  good  faith.  </a></p>
<p><a id="447" name="447">Resorting  to  positions  on  the  issue,  which  may  reflect 
individual Parties’ self interest rather than the broader interests of the country should be guarded 

 

  
 16 

against.</a></p>
<p><a id="448" name="448">It is important that this issue is given the serious consideration that it deserves and that 
no effort be spared in reaching a solution before the formation of the R-TGoNU. 
 

59.  </a></p>
<p><a id="449" name="449">During  the  period  under  review  the  cantonment  process  leading  to  the  redeployment  of  the 
NUF  stalled.  </a></p>
<p><a id="450" name="450">This  was  in  large  part  due  to  the  lack  of  sufficient  and  timely  funding, 
notwithstanding the government’s promise to immediately make available the balance of the 
US $ 100 million pledged following the 10th November Parties’ meeting in Addis Ababa.</a></p>
<p><a id="451" name="451">At 
the time the government revealed that it had already provided US $33 million of the US $100 
million, which it pledged in May in support of the Pre-Transitional activities.  

 

60.</a></p>
<p><a id="452" name="452">In addition, the in-kind support provided by the AU, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Japan, Nigeria and 
Sudan will greatly assist those efforts.</a></p>
<p><a id="453" name="453">Currently, the JDB’s focus and priority has shifted to the 
establishment  of  training  sites,  though  the  funding  available  for  this  task  is  a  fraction  of  the 
estimated requirements of JTSC.</a></p>
<p><a id="454" name="454">The priority is being put on the military element of the NUF 
and the VIP Protection Unit.</a></p>
<p><a id="455" name="455">It is likely that training will need to be completed in phases once 
it commences and it is too early to estimate how much of the NUF will have completed training 
by the end of the 100 days extension.</a></p>
<p><a id="456" name="456">

 

61.</a></p>
<p><a id="457" name="457">Given the delays in availing funding for the implementation of the security tasks, it has proven 
difficult  to  make  substantive  progress.  </a></p>
<p><a id="458" name="458">Even  with  the  6-month  and  the  further  100  days 
extension,  the  key  Chapter  II  security  milestones  of  completing  the  cantonment  process 
(registration, screening and selection) and subsequent training and re-deployment of the NUF 
were  not  achieved.  </a></p>
<p><a id="459" name="459">Importantly,  the  Parties  appear  to  agree  and  accept  that  not  all  of  the 
transitional  security  arrangements  will  have  been  completed  in  time  to  form  the  R-TGoNU. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="460" name="460">However,  it  is  necessary  to  make  irrevocable  progress  towards  completion  of  the  security 
arrangements in order to provide comfort to them just weeks before the scheduled formation of 
the R-TGoNU. 

 

62.</a></p>
<p><a id="461" name="461">A key aspect related to the formation of the NUF is the work of the DDR Commission, which 
needs to take care of or provide options to the former combatants not selected.</a></p>
<p><a id="462" name="462">Therefore, the 
need  to  adequately  fund  the  Commission  will  feature  prominently  in  the  months  and  years 
ahead.  </a></p>
<p><a id="463" name="463">In  the  meantime,  the  Commission’s  capabilities  must  be  made  known  to  the  former 
combatants in order to provide buy-in and help in facilitating the process currently underway. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="464" name="464">Concerning  the  presence  of  families  in  and  around  cantonment  sites,  R-JMEC  has  urged 
TGoNU and the JDB to approach OCHA for support but it has declared itself unable to intervene 
within the cantonment sites unless humanitarian reasons require it. 

 

63.</a></p>
<p><a id="465" name="465">With  regards  to  the  other  outstanding  Pre-Transitional  tasks,  the  Parties  should  pay  close 
attention to the submission of their TNLA representatives’ nominees to the NCAC in a timely 
manner.</a></p>
<p><a id="466" name="466">With less than two months to go before the scheduled formation of the R-TGONU the 
process  should  already be well underway.</a></p>
<p><a id="467" name="467">At the same time, the  government should quickly 
enact the Constitutional Amendment Bill and the other laws previously reviewed by the NCAC. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="468" name="468">This is important in facilitating a smooth transition to the formation of the R-TGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="469" name="469">Finally, 

 

  
 17 

the SDSR Board must work to complete the Strategic Security Assessment while developing 
the  security  policy  framework  and  conducting  analysis  of  the  operational  capabilities  of  the 
national army and security forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="470" name="470">

                                                   VII.</a></p>
<p><a id="471" name="471">Conclusion 

64.  </a></p>
<p><a id="472" name="472">After  two  consecutive  postponements  of  the  formation  of  the  R-TGoNU,  there  is  still  only 
limited progress towards the resolution of the two critical issues that prompted the delay.</a></p>
<p><a id="473" name="473">With 
only a few weeks left to the end of the 100 days extension, every effort must be made by the 
Parties  at  this  time,  to  redouble  their  efforts  at  tackling  these  outstanding  tasks.  </a></p>
<p><a id="474" name="474">Without  the 
predictable flow of financial resources, and the continued movement of former combatants to 
the training centres, the process could very well stall.</a></p>
<p><a id="475" name="475">Also, without the political will and spirit 
of compromise to arrive at a solution on the number of states and their boundaries, this could 
prove a serious stumbling block to sustained and lasting peace in South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="476" name="476">
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="477" name="477">65.  </a></p>
<p><a id="478" name="478">No doubt, the long suffering people of South Sudan continue to pin their hopes for a return to 
normalcy and improved livelihoods on progress made in the implementation of the Agreement. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="479" name="479">This desire by the people of South Sudan for peace is clearly demonstrated by the increasing 
number prepared to abandon the refugee and internally displaced camps to return to their homes 
and communities.</a></p>
<p><a id="480" name="480">Unless the momentum to tackle the outstanding issues is maintained this very 
promising  trend  could  very  easily  be  reversed.  </a></p>
<p><a id="481" name="481">An  Agreement  among  the  Parties  on  the 
determination  of  the  number  of  states  and  boundaries  would  be  a  boost  to  the  entire  peace 
process.</a></p>
<p><a id="482" name="482">Equally important  would be visible and sustained progress  towards the training and 
redeployment of the NUF.  </a></p>
<p><a id="483" name="483">Failure to achieve any or both of the critical pending tasks can cause 
a bitter blow to the hopes and aspirations of the millions of South Sudanese who continue to 
yearn for peace.</a></p>
<p><a id="484" name="484">

 

66.</a></p>
<p><a id="485" name="485">RJMEC on its part shall continue to impartially monitor, evaluate and report as it vigorously 
carries out its oversight responsibilities with regards to the R-ARCSS, and make interventions 
where and when necessary.</a></p>
<p><a id="486" name="486">RJMEC will also continue providing regular reports and briefings 
to the incumbent TGoNU, the TNLA, the Chairperson of the IGAD Council of Ministers, the 
Chairperson of the African Union Commission, the AU Peace and Security Council, and to the 
UN Secretary-General and the United Nations Security Council.
