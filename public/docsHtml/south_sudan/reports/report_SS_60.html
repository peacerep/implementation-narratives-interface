<p><a id="14" name="14">Following the receipt of reports from the Monitoring and Verification Teams (MVTs)

INVESTIGATIONS INTO VIOLATIONS OF THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES
AGREEMENT IN UNITY AND UPPER NILE STATES
(31 MAY — 04 JUNE 2014)

1.0  Introduction
1.1    The scope of this report covers hostilities between parties that occurred over the
period 31 May — 04 June 2014 resulting in reports of Government and SPLM/A-IO Forces
fighting in Nassir (Nassir County, Upper Nile State), Wank-Kay (Mayom County, Unity State)
and Bentiu (Rubkona County, Unity State).
</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">1.2      The aim of this report is to provide IGAD Special Envoys with an analysis of the events
surrounding the hostilities in Upper Nile and Unity States over the period 31 May — 04 June
2014.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">And, where relevant, apportion responsibilities for violations of the COHA to either of
the parties.
</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">1.3      This report outlines the investigation and verification methodology, citing key
documents in the process.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">It summarizes the main events surrounding the potential violations
and makes an assessment of possible violations of the COHA, based on evidence gathered.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">It
concludes with the JTC’s opinion on the attribution of responsibilities for the violations.
2.0  Investigation / Verification Methodology
2.1      Employing Monitoring and Verification Mechanism (MVM) Standard Operating
Procedures, the MVTs based in UNMISS camps in Nassir and Bentiu initiated the
investigation / verification sequence with Flash Reports and Daily Situation Reports over the
period 31 May — 04 June.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">Subsequently, the JTC formally issued Investigation and Verification
Orders to MVT Nassir on  June, and to MVT Bentiu on  June, following direction from the
JTC Chairman.
</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">2.2      The MVTs conducted investigations in accordance with the orders, in order to augment
the information already provided and corroborate reports received from other sources.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The
results of initial investigations were two MVT Investigations and Verification Reports on  and
 June.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">This report is based on the combined analysis of all reports and evidence received by
the JTC up until 1100hrs on 09 June 2014.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">All relevant MVT reports are referenced in this
document and available for additional scrutiny, if required.
3.0  Main Events — Nassir (Upper Nile State)'
3.1      MVT and open-source reporting suggest that hostilities took place in Nassir on 31 May
from 0600-0900hrs, on 02 June from 0320-0800hrs, and on 03 June 2014 from 0900-1600hrs.
</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">Reports further indicate that hostilities took place between the SPLM/A-IO Forces (located

<p><a id="39" name="39">IGAD JTC MVM

southwest across the River Sobat) and the Government Forces (located in Nassir town).
</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">Evidence suggests the SPLM/A-IO Forces initiated the hostilities by firing at Government
Forces in Nassir, and the Government Forces responded in self-defence.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">Unconfirmed reports
suggest the motivation for the engagement was to drive the Government Forces out of Nassir
and also to prevent any aircraft from landing in order to deny the Government Forces any
resupplies.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">Government Forces claimed that one soldier was killed and one was injured during
the fighting.
3.2     On 03 June 2014, small-arms fire from SPLM/A IO Forces was directed at two IGAD
aircraft.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">The first aircraft, which approached the Nassir airfield from the southwest, came
under heavy fire.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">Information from UNMISS in Nassir indicates that approximately 250 small-
arms rounds and two RPGs were fired at the aircraft.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">The aircraft was not hit.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">The second
aircraft also received incoming fire and made a quick turn northwards before landing safely.
</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">There were no casualties caused by this incident.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">JTC and MVT personnel were able to give
firsthand accounts of the violation.”
3.3     The commander of the Government Forces in the Nassir area is Brigadier Kong Thon
Kong.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">The commander of the SPLM/A-IO forces in the surrounding area of Nassir is thought
to be Major General Gathoth Gatkuoth.
4.0  Assessment — Nassir (Upper Nile State)
41     JTC assessments indicate that SPLM/A-IO Forces initiated the fighting in Nassir
(Upper Nile State) on 31 May, 02 and 03 June and, as such, failed to cease all military actions
in accordance with the COHA.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">Furthermore, SPLM/A-IO failed to refrain from taking actions
that could lead to military confrontations, in violation of the COHA.
5.0  Main Events — Wang-Kay (Unity State)*
5.1      MVT reports are inconclusive but indicate that a number of unconfirmed actions led to
hostilities around Wang-Kay (a base that is occupied by Government Forces) on 02 June.
</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Unconfirmed reports indicate that armed personnel loyal to SPLM/A-IO clashed with
Government Forces when the latter was conducting civilian disarmament operations.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">The
armed personnel then linked-up with SPLM/A-IO Forces under the command of Major General
Peter Gadet, who were intending to meet elders from Mayom County.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">Subsequently,
unconfirmed reports indicate there were hostilities between the forces of both parties, around
Wang-Kay, resulting initially in the capture of the area by SPLM/A-IO, but with the
Government Forces reoccupying the location upon the withdrawal of the SPLM/A-IO.
6.0  Assessment — Wang-Kay (Unity State)
6.1     JTC assessments indicate that the events in Wang-Kay on 02 June are unconfirmed
and therefore investigations are inconclusive.

7.0  Main Events - Bentiu (Unity State)*
7.1      Hostilities between parties took place in/around Bentiu in three different locations, over
two days:</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">Tong Island (03 June), Ariab (04 June) and Magazine (04 June):

* Tong Island (approximately 0620-1000hrs on 03 June)</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">Reports     indicate     that
Government Forces were conducting a routine patrol to ensure the security of the
Bentiu when an engagement with SPLM/A-IO Forces took place.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Government Forces
claim to have killed a number of SPLM/A-IO personnel, but there is currently no
evidence to support this.

</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">•</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Ariab (approximately 0600-1000hrs on 04 June)</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">Reports     indicate     that     the
Government Force southern defensive line, located at a place known as Ariab, was
engaged by small arms and Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) fire by approximately
200-300 personnel from SPLM/A-IO Forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">Government Forces claim to have
repelled the attack through counter-fire.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Magazine (approximately 1400-1600hrs on 04 June)    </a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">Reports indicate that the
Government Force eastern defensive line, located at a place known as Magazine, was
engaged by small arms and RPG fire by up to 400 personnel from SPLM/A-IO Forces.
</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">Government Forces claim to have repelled the attack through counter-fire.
</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Unconfirmed reports indicate that seven Government Force soldiers were injured
during the engagement.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">

8.0  Assessment — Bentiu (Unity State)
8.1      JTC assessments indicate that the investigations into events in Bentiu on 03 - 04 June
are inconclusive.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">SPLM/A-IO Forces fought with Government Forces on 04 June at Ariab and
Magazine and, as such, failed to cease all military actions in accordance with the COHA.
</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">However, responsibility for the initiation of the attacks has yet to be confirmed.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">The
investigations into the engagement at Tong Island are considered inconclusive, and likely to
be the result of a meeting engagement by patrols of both parties.
</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">9.0  Conclusion
9.1      JTC and MVT investigations, verification, evidence collection and analytical processes
indicate that SPLM/A-IO Forces committed violations of the COHA in three main categories in
Nassir (Upper Nile State) on 31 May, 02 and 03 June 2014:</a></p>
