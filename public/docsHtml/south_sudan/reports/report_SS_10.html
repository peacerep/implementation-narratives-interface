EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">On  September 2021 a 45-year-old woman was raped in Yabongo Boma, Nzara
County.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">The rape was committed by an SPLM/A-IO soldier from Lirangu camp which
is the location of SPLM/A-IO Div 9B. In addition the soldier stole property and
money from the home of the victim/survivor.
</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that the SPLM/A-IO failed to exercise command and
control by properly training soldiers to refrain from misconduct such as Sexual and
Gender Based Violence and theft of civilian property.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">The SPLM/A-IO has failed to
fulfil its obligations to protect civilians as required by Articles  and  of the Agreement
on Cessation of Hostilities of 21 December 2017, as incorporated into Article 2.1.10.0 
of the R-ARCSS of 12 September 2018.

Payam.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">SPLM/A-IO Sector  and Division 9B HQs are in Lirangu Payam, Yambio
County, near the southwest border with Nzara County.

6.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">On  September 2021 at about 2200 hours, a 45-year-old woman was raped in
Yabongo Boma, Nzara County.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">It is reported by the victim that there were three
males involved in the incident, that she was asleep at the time, and that she was
awakened by a commotion outside her home.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">Thinking that the noise was made
by her nephews, who had been outside her home earlier, she called them but
instead three men responded and entered her home.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">Of the trio, only one was
armed and one appeared to be in charge.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">They were dressed in a mixture of army
uniform and sports attire and were recognised by the victim/survivor of the rape as
belonging to the SPLM/A-IO camp at Lirangu.

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">The male believed to be in charge dragged the woman out of her home and made
her sit down a few meters from her tukul.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">He ordered the other two males to look
out for her nephews, but they had fled the scene when the three men arrived.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">The male believed to be in charge then raped the woman and left her lying prostrate
on the ground and ordered her not to move an inch.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">He then left to call the other
two so that they could have their way with her as well.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">Fortunately, the woman
managed to escape into the bush until morning.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">The rape was witnessed by the
woman’s nephews who were watching from the bush after they had fled from the
three males.

 September 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">She also discovered on returning to her home that her two
cellular phones had been stolen,as well as cash amounting to SSP ,800.

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">The victim, accompanied by the village Sub-chief and a youth leader, reported the
matter to SPLM/A-IO HQ in Lirangu Payam on  August 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">The Chief
Inspector of Police Nzara County informed the MVT that the rape incident was not
reported to the Nzara Police HQ.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">The Chief Inspector explained that, due to stigma,
most victims go silent or choose to resolve the matter at the village level.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">

</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">11.On arriving at Lirangu Camp of SPLM/A-IO Div 9B on  August, the victim/survivor
and, the sub-chief were directed to the Division Commander, Maj Gen Simon
Samuel Alisolomon, who informed them he was already aware of the incident and
then directed them to an office where they would be helped.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">The victim/survivor
was asked whether she could identify the perpetrator, her statement was taken,
and an identification parade was assembled.

12.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">The victim/survivor was able to identify her attacker from the line-up.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">Subsequently
she was referred to an arbitration office where the accused was found guilty.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">On
the same day as her visit, the accused was flogged in public and fined 50,000 SSP.
</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Also on that same day her phone and SSP ,800 were recovered.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">The identities
and whereabouts.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">of the other two soldiers involved in the incident are unknown.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">The Commander confirmed to CTSAMVM that the perpetrator was found guilty at
an arbitration, flogged in public, and fined SSP 50,000 before being placed in
custody.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">The Commander of the SPLM/A-IO Div 9B reported that the case was
referred to the Administration Department.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">After  days in custody the perpetrator
escaped, and it is reported that he joined the forces of Maj Gen James Nando and
was last heard of in Tambura.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">The Commander reported that the perpetrator had
previously been affiliated to the forces of Maj Gen James Nando.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">

14.0 n 11 September, the day after visiting Lirangu, the victim/survivor developed
severe abdominal pain and was rushed to Nzara County Hospital.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">She has
received psychotherapy and has been referred to Nzara Hospital for follow-on

1.
treatment.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">Because 72 hours lapsed between the rape and visiting the hospital,
she could not be given Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP).</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">The victim/survivor has
not received the SSP 50,000 ordered to be paid by the perpetrator.

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">When she was interviewed by CTSAMVM the victim/survivor was in pain and
severely traumatised.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">Her nephews were also traumatised, having witnessed such
an atrocity, and the family live in fear of further violence.

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">The County Commissioner and Chief Inspector of Police reported that most victims
of rape prefer to remain silent or try to resolve such matters at the village level
because of the stigma associated with rape.

</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">Assessment

17.The evidence found during the investigation indicates a 45-year-old woman was
subjected to a vicious rape attack on  September 2021 and that the attack was
committed by an SPLM/A-IO soldier from Lirangu Camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">While it was reported that
the perpetrator had previously been affiliated to Maj Gen Nando at the time of the
incident he was clearly under the command of SPLM/A-IO Div 9B because he was
paraded for the victim/survivor to identify him.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">Witnesses also stated that the
perpetrator was recognised as a soldier from Lirangu which is controlled by
SPLM/A-IO Div 9B.

18.The evidence found during the investigation indicates the soldier who committed
the rape also took property and money from the victim/survivor’s home.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">

</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">19.A form of justice was swiftly administered by SPLM/A-IO but it did not result in
payment of any compensation.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">Neither did the justice administered provide any
specific or general deterrence, as the failure to keep the perpetrator in custody has
unleashed a dangerous individual who may commit further attacks.

20.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">Because victim/survivors fear being stigmatised when subjected to rape and other
SGBV assaults, such incidents are under-reported.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">Moreover, victim/survivors are
hesitant to seek timely medical and psychological treatment.

.
</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">Conclusion

21.It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that the SPLM/A-IO failed to exercise command
and control by properly training soldiers to refrain from misconduct such as SGBV
and theft of civilian property.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">The SPLM/A-IO has failed to fulfil its obligations to
protect civilians as required by Articles  and  of the Agreement on Cessation of
Hostilities of 21 December 2017, as incorporated into Article 2.0.10.0  of the R-
ARCSS of 12 September 2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">

</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">Observations and Recommendations

22.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">The-‘SPLM/A-IO should redouble its efforts to train its soldiers on the requirements
of the ACOH and R-ARCSS agreements and on the prohibitions against rape and
sexual abuse and the requirement to respect the person and dignity of women.

23.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">As a policy parties should not accept convicted criminals into their ranks.
</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">Investigations are required by SSPDF to determine the status of the perpetrator
and if required remove him from duty.

24.SPLM/A-IO should exercise more control over the forces in Lirangu and expedite
the movement of forces to Cantonment Sites or Training Centres.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">

25.SPLM/A-IO must continue to conduct routine training and education at all rank
levels to ensure commanders and their subordinates understand and abide by their
duty to protect civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">

</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">26.Boma and County officials should improve liaison between medical providers,
police, and SPLM/A-IO to encourage vulnerable groups to report SGBV and other
protection-of-civilian trangressions.
