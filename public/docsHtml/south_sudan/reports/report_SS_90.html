MESSAGE FROM THE INTERIM CHAIRPERSON OF RJMEC 

</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">As the Interim Chairperson of the Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation 

Commission (RJMEC), I am honored to bring to you this very detailed comparative 

report  on  the  “post-conflict  constitution  making-processes”.  </a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">This  report  builds  on 

our  continuous  and  ongoing  efforts,  to  help  the  people  of  the  Republic  of  South 

Sudan in their search for enduring peace, justice and good governance based on the 

rule  of  law  and  constitutionalism.  </a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">It  is  intended  to  provide  a  useful  reading  and 

background material for the parties and stakeholders in the country as they consider 

the best possible path towards the making of a permanent constitution.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97"> 

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">There are many cases documented in this study and many lessons to be drawn by 

any country embarking on such an important journey.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">As indicated in the report, the 

making of a permanent constitution is not an easy task, especially in transitioning 

countries emerging from conflicts.</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">Many of the case studies were countries which 

were grappling with a myriad of issues akin to South Sudan today.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">However, some 

of these countries that have navigated this path before, did it successfully, but others 

not very successfully.  

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">Having examined about twenty-one of such countries, with similar experiences and 

different outcomes, the study report offers a wide range of examples and approaches 

for the South Sudanese parties to learn from.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">It is my hope that it will contribute to 

their choices of a combination of approaches that would yield positive results within 

the South Sudan context.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">The R-ARCSS already lays a framework for the making of 

a  permanent  constitution  which  mirrors  many  of  the  processes  highlighted  in  the 

study.</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105"> 

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">Under Chapter Six of the R-ARCSS, amongst other things provides that:</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">it is the 

responsibility of the RTGoNU to initiate and oversee the permanent constitution 

making process;</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">the RTGoNU is required to adequately budget for the process;</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">there 

are clear parameters that be adhered to in the making of the permanent constitution;</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">

a law should be enacted to govern the process;</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">the National Constitutional Review 

Commission  should  be  reconstituted;</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112"> </a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">a  Preparatory  Sub-Committee  for  the 

convening  of  the  National  Constitutional  Conference  should  be  appointed;</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">

 
v 

 

 

 

assistance  must  be  sought  from  regional  and  international  experts;</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115"> </a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">the  draft 

Constitutional  Text  must  be  adopted  by  the  Constitutional  Conference;</a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117"> </a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">the 

permanent constitution making process should be completed within 24 months;</a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">and 

the  TNLA  shall  transform  itself  into  the  Constituent  Assembly  and  adopt  the 

Constitution.</a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120"> 

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">Therefore,  what  the  parties  are  expected  to  achieve  at  the  constitution  process 

workshop is simply to fill in the gaps, for example, on who will draft the text of the 

constitution,  conduct  civic  education,  public  consultations,    how  they  are 

constituted, when and where etc. including integrating some of the emerging best 

practices, including those highlighted in this report.</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122"> 

 

I  want  to  sincerely  thank  Dr.  Busingye  Kabumba,  our  consultant  for  the 

thoroughness of his work in developing this report, as well as Mr. Stephen Oola, our 

Senior Advisor on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for his guidance on this matter 

and contributions to the report.</a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">I also wish to acknowledge the contributions of Dr. 

Job Baptist Akuni and Mr. Guy Gabriel for editorial comments.  

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">I also extend my appreciation to the regional and International Partners and Friends 

of  South  Sudan  who  provided  both  financial  and  in-kind  support  to  the  RJMEC 

Secretariat to undertake this kind of work.</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">Finally, I extend my gratitude to the Chief 

of Staff of the RJMEC and all the Staff at the Secretariat for their contribution to this 

report  and  I  hope  the  parties  and  people  of  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan  and  all 

readers will find this report useful.

<p><a id="128" name="128">It  compares  the  constitution-making

</a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">The case studies were carefully selected, taking into account the extent to which their

In the main, the study identifies the need for:</a></p>
<p><a id="145" name="145">i) legitimate and effective constitution-

making  bodies,  including  a  Constitutional  Commission  (charged  with  conducting 

public  education  and  consultation,  and  developing  the  first  draft  of  the  new 

Constitution) and an elected Constituent Assembly (tasked with deliberating upon the 

draft Constitution and adopting a final draft Constitution);</a></p>
<p><a id="146" name="146">ii) the adoption of broad 

guiding principles to inform the constitution-making process, which should also allow 

for judicial oversight over the process;</a></p>
<p><a id="147" name="147">iii) robust public participation and engagement, 

which should be preceded by thorough, indepth and widespread civic education, and 

which  should  enable  and  encourage  the  participation  of  vulnerable  or  traditionally

excluded groups;</a></p>
<p><a id="148" name="148">iv) sufficient allocation of time for the process (1-3 years), and the 

separation  of  constitution-making  from  the  negotiation  of  peace  agreements;</a></p>
<p><a id="149" name="149"> </a></p>
<p><a id="150" name="150">v)  a 

limited role for the international community and expert groups so as to ensure a truly 

organic and home-grown constitutional document;</a></p>
<p><a id="151" name="151">vi) the adoption of the final draft 

Constitution by a referendum and vii) post-adoption safeguards, including continued 

civic education as well as judicial oversight over the new constitutional dispensation.</a></p>

INTRODUCTION 

</a></p>
<p><a id="154" name="154">The Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South 
Sudan  (R-ARCSS),  signed  on  12th  September  2018  in  Addis  Ababa,  Ethiopia, 
mandates the Revitalised Transitional Government of National Unity (R-TGoNU) to 

initiate and oversee a permanent constitution-making process during the Transitional 
Period.1 The permanent constitution-making process is expected to be completed not 
later  than  twenty-four  (24)  months  following  the  establishment  of  the  Transitional 
Period and shall be in place to guide the elections towards the end of the Transition.2 

Article  6.7  of  the  Agreement  mandates  the  Reconstituted  Joint  Monitoring  and 

Evaluation Commission (RJMEC) to convene a workshop for the Parties to the peace 

agreement to discuss and agree on the details of conducting the constitution-making 

process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="155" name="155">The  workshop  is  expected  to  be  facilitated  by  an  institute  renowned 

internationally for constitution-making.</a></p>
<p><a id="156" name="156">The outcome of the workshop shall form the 

basis  for  drafting  the  legislation  to  be  enacted  to  govern  the  constitution-making 
process.3 

</a></p>
<p><a id="157" name="157">In preparation for the convening of the constitutional process workshop for the parties 

to  the  R-ARCSS,  the  RJMEC  Secretariat  commissioned  this  study  on  comparative 

constitutional  making  processes,  as  part  of  generating  the  requisite  background 

documents for the workshop, to inform the parties in their deliberations.</a></p>
<p><a id="158" name="158">

</a></p>
<p><a id="159" name="159">This  report  contains  a  comparative  analysis  of  the  constitution-making  processes 

adopted  by  21  jurisdictions  from  around  the  world,  from  which  best  practices, 

emerging  trends  and  lesson-drawing  can  be  made  for  the  process  in  South  Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="160" name="160">

</a></p>
<p><a id="161" name="161">Although  it  was  initially  envisaged  to  analyze  the  experiences  of  6  countries,  the 

number of case studies was expanded so as to ensure greater explanatory power for the 

conclusions derived from their examination.</a></p>
<p><a id="162" name="162"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="163" name="163">The jurisdictions for analysis were carefully chosen.</a></p>
<p><a id="164" name="164">In large part, this was on the basis 

of the circumstances in which the constitution-making processes occurred, which made

significant natural resources;</a></p>
<p><a id="175" name="175">and religious and other factors.</a></p>
<p><a id="176" name="176">The case studies selected 

and  profiled  herein  are  therefore  relevant  for  the  envisaged  constitution-making 

process in South Sudan because of the similarities they have to the circumstances of 

South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="177" name="177">

<p><a id="178" name="178">The  study  is  presented  in  four  parts.  </a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="203" name="203">Benin gained its independence from France in 1960, and its current Constitution is the 
Constitution  of  1990.8  The  Constitution  of  1990  was  drawn  by  a  Constitutional 

Commission  established  by  a  National  Conference  that  fast  became  a  model  for 
peaceful  democratic  transition  in  Francophone  Africa,9  and  adopted  by  the  people 

through a referendum, all in 1990.</a></p>
<p><a id="204" name="204">

</a></p>
<p><a id="205" name="205">Between  1963  and  1972,  Benin  experienced  eight  coups  d’état,  adopted  ten 
constitutions, and saw ten presidents,10 earning herself the moniker ‘the sick child of 

Africa’.</a></p>
<p><a id="206" name="206">The political and constitutional instability that plagued the country between 

1960 and 1972 had partial foundation in a North-South regional and ethnic divide.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="207" name="207">Benin’s  1990  Constitution  thus  focuses  on  democratisation  and  the  protection  of 

fundamental  rights  and  freedoms,  and  sought  to  ‘heal  the  Benin  political  and 
constitutional instability syndrome.’11</a></p>
<p><a id="208" name="208">Twenty eight years after its current Constitution 

was promulgated, Benin has now seen four changes of government, has never missed 

any presidential or municipal election, and has never had its Constitution successfully 

amended  although  four  attempts  have  been  made,  most  recently  in  2017  after  the 

incumbent’s attempt to introduce one-term limits for the presidency failed.</a></p>
<p><a id="209" name="209"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="210" name="210">The apparent success of the 1990 Constitution is attributable to its drafting history (the 

enactment process) in addition to the role of civil society and the supervision by Benin’s 
Constitutional  Court.12  More  specifically,  Benin’s  ‘legacy  of  broadly  inclusive  and 

participatory processes in the making of the original (1990) constitution’ is thought to 

have  established  ‘expectations  of  similar  levels  of  participation  for  significant

<p><a id="222" name="222">A  brief 

account of the history of the constitution-making process in Benin is given below.</a></p>
<p><a id="223" name="223">

</a></p>
<p><a id="224" name="224">In  1972,  Mathieu  Kérékou  took  power  via  a  coup  d’état  and  for  the  next  17  years, 

established a police state under a Marxist-Leninist and one-party state government.</a></p>
<p><a id="225" name="225">By 

1989,  the  Kérékou  government  was  facing  an  economic  crisis  accompanied  by 

increased political agitation for reform.</a></p>
<p><a id="226" name="226">In this context, Kérékou bowed to pressure and 

facilitated the convening of a national conference in February 1990.</a></p>
<p><a id="227" name="227">The Constitution 

of  Benin  was  then  drawn  up  by  a  Constitutional  Commission  established  by  the 

National Conference and then approved by the people of Benin, in a referendum.</a></p>
<p><a id="228" name="228">

</a></p>
<p><a id="229" name="229">With regard to political and constitutional reforms, Kérékou appointed a committee 

of  ministers  to  organise  the  national  conference,  a  conference  of  all  forces  (parties, 

movements,  other  organisations  etcetera).  </a></p>
<p><a id="230" name="230">This  committee  was  headed  by  Robert 

Dossou who had, in fact, been a moderate opposition leader.</a></p>
<p><a id="231" name="231">

</a></p>
<p><a id="232" name="232">The  Dossou  committee,  comprising  both  government  and  opposition  members, 

decided the composition and the agenda of the national conference.</a></p>
<p><a id="233" name="233">It also agreed on 

the basic principles that a new constitution had to meet.</a></p>
<p><a id="234" name="234">The Committee was therefore 

a  roundtable  of  sorts  and  this  contributed  quite  a  lot  to  the  success  of  the  national 

conference  by  ensuring  a  basic  understanding  amongst  key  opponents  before  the 

conference met.</a></p>
<p><a id="235" name="235">

</a></p>
<p><a id="236" name="236">The national conference had approximately 488 members and about 10% of the seats 

were reserved for government supporters.</a></p>
<p><a id="237" name="237">52 ‘political tendencies’ were represented, 

including unionists, religious groups, agricultural producers, civil servants, students, 

and  Beninese 

living  abroad.  </a></p>
<p><a id="238" name="238">Representatives  of 

international  missions  and 

international financial institutions also attended the conference.</a></p>

However, the vast majority of the members of the conference were drawn from the 

political and elite classes, contrary to the statement that the conference represented all 
‘living forces of the nation.’14</a></p>
<p><a id="246" name="246">

</a></p>
<p><a id="247" name="247">The conference sat for only ten days (19-28 February 1990), but because of the prior 

agreements  reached  by  the  Dossou  committee,  it  was  able  to  achieve  a  lot.  </a></p>
<p><a id="248" name="248">Its 

proceedings  were  broadcast  live  on  television  and  radio,  and  a  great  deal  of 

international media attention was attracted.</a></p>
<p><a id="249" name="249">

</a></p>
<p><a id="250" name="250">In December 1989, Kérékou had also made a public request for suggestions on how to 

reconstruct the country, leading to the presentation of the seven volumes of responses 
to  the  national  conference.15  The  conference  deliberated  on  these  views.  </a></p>
<p><a id="251" name="251">The 
conference also declared itself sovereign, put in place a transitional constitution and 

dissolved the national legislature and executive existing then, replacing them instead 

with a transitional legislature and a transitional executive.</a></p>
<p><a id="252" name="252"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="253" name="253">In Benin’s case, there was a one-year transition period between the old military, one -

party  constitutional  order  and  the  new  order  based  on  the  1990  Constitution.  </a></p>
<p><a id="254" name="254">The 

conference  further  adopted  plans  for  multiparty  elections  and  designated  the  High 

Council responsible for developing the final draft constitution.</a></p>
<p><a id="255" name="255">

</a></p>
<p><a id="256" name="256">In  exchange  for  accepting  the  conference’s  declaration  of  sovereignty,  President 

Kérékou gained a pardon for any crimes he might have committed during his past and 
then-present tenure.16</a></p>
<p><a id="257" name="257">This decision to grant Kérékou a pardon maintained the focus 

of the conference as a forward-looking entity.</a></p>
<p><a id="258" name="258">

</a></p>
<p><a id="259" name="259">Much of the conference’s work was done in committees, the most significant of which 

was the Commission of Constitutional Affairs—which prepared the preliminary draft 

text for the constitution that was submitted to the High Council.</a></p>

December 2 1991 resulted in overwhelming support for the draft constitution which 

was thus approved.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="268" name="268">Benin’s 1990 Constitution was therefore drafted by a Commission of Constitutional 

Affairs (a committee of the National Conference) and a High Council designated by 

the  National  Conference  which  had,  in  turn,  been  organised  by  a  committee  of 

ministers  appointed  by  the  President  from  amongst  both  the  ruling  ‘party’  and 

members  of  the  opposition.  </a></p>
<p><a id="269" name="269">This  National  Conference  was  broadly  inclusive  and 

participatory,  and  the  final  Constitution  was  ultimately  adopted  in  a  referendum 

thereby ending a one-year constitution-making process.</a></p>

<p><a id="272" name="272">East Timor 

In 1975, East Timor became independent of Portugal but was, nine days later, invaded 

and annexed by Indonesia.</a></p>
<p><a id="273" name="273">Indonesian rule lasted 23 years, ending in 1999 when in a 

UN-supervised  independence  referendum  held  on  August  30,  1999,  78.5%  of  the 

Timorese  population  voted  for  independence  from  Indonesia  and  therefore  against 
East Timor being an autonomous province of Indonesia.17 

Following the independence referendum of 1999, the UN Security Council set up a 

transitional  government 

for  East  Timor—the  United  Nations  Transitional 

Administration 

in  East  Timor 

(UNTAET)—which  provided  both  a  civil 

administration and peace keeping force until 20 May, 2002 when the country became 

independent again with its own internal government.</a></p>
<p><a id="274" name="274">20 May, 2002 is also the date on 
which East Timor’s current constitution commenced operation.18 

</a></p>
<p><a id="275" name="275">Most of the decision-making power with regard to the making of East Timor’s 2002 

Constitution  resided  with  the  UNTAET.  </a></p>
<p><a id="276" name="276">UNTAET  was  under  pressure  to  effect  a 

speedy transition and therefore eventually leaned in favour of an expedited process that 

would involve election of a Constituent Assembly which would then be obligated to

<p><a id="284" name="284">On the other hand, an umbrella group 

of the major political parties in East Timor at the time—the National Congress of the 

National  Council  for  Timorese  Resistance  (CNRT)  wanted  a  ‘long-term’  process 

characterised by broad-based public consultation.</a></p>
<p><a id="285" name="285">

</a></p>
<p><a id="286" name="286">UNTAET adopted the expedited process and thus, the making of East Timor’s 2002 

Constitution  was  quite  rushed.  </a></p>
<p><a id="287" name="287">It  was  decided  that  an  88-member  Constituent 

Assembly would be elected and given 90 days within which to enact a Constitution.</a></p>
<p><a id="288" name="288">It 

would also have the option of transforming itself into the first Parliament under the 

new Constitution.</a></p>
<p><a id="289" name="289">The drafting period was, however, later extended by a further ninety 
days.19 The 88-member Constituent Assembly was sworn in on 15 September 2001 and 

the Constitution it enacted entered into force on 20 May 2002.</a></p>
<p><a id="290" name="290">

</a></p>
<p><a id="291" name="291">This Constitution was not subjected to a referendum.</a></p>
<p><a id="292" name="292">The election itself – of members 

to the Constituent Assembly – was seen by the UNTAET as a sufficiently democratic 

founding act that would legitimise the process.</a></p>
<p><a id="293" name="293">Although the Catholic Church in East 

Timor had proposed the adoption of a transitional interim constitution (as in South 

Africa’s  case),  this  was  rejected.  </a></p>
<p><a id="294" name="294">For  the  Constitution  to  be  adopted,  60  of  the  88 

members (68%) of the Constituent Assembly had to consent.</a></p>
<p><a id="295" name="295">

</a></p>
<p><a id="296" name="296">The voter turnout for the Constituent Assembly elections was 90%, and 16 political 

parties were engaged in the process.</a></p>
<p><a id="297" name="297">Only 27% of the elected members of the Assembly 

were  women.  </a></p>
<p><a id="298" name="298">FRETILIN,  a  political  party,  won  most  of  the  seats  (55  out  of  88),

</a></p>
<p><a id="300" name="300">The  discernible  flaws  in  the  process  adopted  in  East  Timor  are  several.  </a></p>
<p><a id="301" name="301">Firstly,  the 

makers of the constitution were not required to consult with the public.</a></p>
<p><a id="302" name="302">Secondly, the

Thirdly, because the process was rushed, the views of the people were not carefully 

gathered and analysed.</a></p>
<p><a id="308" name="308">Lastly, the process was not truly national/Timorese because of 

the far-reaching role played by UNTAET.</a></p>
<p><a id="309" name="309">

</a></p>
<p><a id="310" name="310">The Timorese Constitution of 2002 largely followed the draft constitution prepared by 
FRETILIN  beforehand,  and  FRETILIN  was  the  dominant  party  and  voice.21  </a></p>
<p><a id="311" name="311">This 
dominance made the Constituent Assembly less representative and affected consensus 

building.</a></p>
<p><a id="312" name="312">Nevertheless, a few compromises were made with other parties or interest 

groups in the process.</a></p>
<p><a id="313" name="313"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="314" name="314">Due to pressure from civil society and the media, the Constituent Assembly eventually 

held  a  one-week  public  consultation  process  on  the  draft  Constitution,  although  its 

planning was poor;</a></p>
<p><a id="315" name="315">particularly, the public had little time to read it, it was not always 
available in a language they understood, and their views were gathered in an ad hoc 

manner.  </a></p>
<p><a id="316" name="316">Public  consultation,  in  fact,  had  little  impact  on  the  final  content  of  the 
Constitution.22 

Thus, FRETILIN’s dominance and the limited participation of the Timorese public 

both weakened the legitimacy of the 2002 constitution, which was not viewed as a 

product of broad consensus building and dialogue.</a></p>
<p><a id="317" name="317">

</a></p>
<p><a id="318" name="318">Conclusively,  the  Timorese  Constitution  was  drafted  by  an  elected,  88-member 
Constituent  Assembly  within  180  days,23  in  process  that  was  organised  by  a  UN 
Administration—the  United  Nations  Transitional  Administration  in  East  Timor 

(UNTAET).</a></p>
<p><a id="319" name="319">The process was an expedited one without sufficient public participation 

and  consultation,  and  no  referendum  was  held  on  the  final  adoption  of  the 

Constitution.</a></p>
<p><a id="320" name="320">Furthermore, the limited civil education and public consultation that did 

occur  was  conducted  simultaneously,  and  the  constitution-making  process  largely 

followed a draft that had been drawn up by the dominant party—FRETLIN. 

 

adopted, although as a compromise, UNTAET organized thirteen commissions to educate the public 
and obtain their views and suggestions regarding the Constitution.</a></p>

<p><a id="332" name="332">In  1978,  the 

Peoples’  Democratic  Party  of  Afghanistan  (PDPA)—with  Soviet  support—

successfully deposed President Mohammed Daoud Khan.</a></p>
<p><a id="333" name="333">A civil war soon broke out, 

pitting Pakistani and USA-backed Afghan Mujahideen guerrillas against the PDPA 

government.</a></p>
<p><a id="334" name="334">In 1994, the Taliban—an Islamist fundamentalist military and political 

organisation—rose as one of the factions in the Afghan civil war and, between 1996 
and 2001, controlled close to three quarters of Afghanistan.24 

</a></p>
<p><a id="335" name="335">Following  the  September  11  attacks  on  US  soil  by  Al-Qaeda,  the  US  and  its  allies 

undertook  a  military  campaign  (part  of  Operation  Enduring  Freedom)  against  the 

Taliban government and ultimately overthrew it.</a></p>
<p><a id="336" name="336">This fall of the Taliban presented an

to choose the leader of an interim authority, was held under the auspices of the United 
Nations.25 These leaders represented a few political factions and sought to agree on a 

path of political transition.</a></p>
<p><a id="339" name="339">Although this Conference left out some key stakeholders, 

the Afghan political transition in general gradually became more representative.</a></p>

<p><a id="341" name="341">Partly  because  of  Afghanistan’s  perceived  centrality  to  the  war  on  terror,  the 

international community was highly interested and involved in the transition process

<p><a id="360" name="360">The Constitutional Loya Jirga, which comprised 502 delegates, had:</a></p>

of those special groups’ rights in the final draft of the Constitution (with the backing of 
the United States and the United Nations).27 

Although the Constitutional Loya Jirga’s rules of procedure were drafted to try and 

exclude influential warlords out of the process, a few were elected and they exerted 

significant  influence  in  the  Assembly,  at  times  silencing  opposing  views.  </a></p>

On 4 January, 2004, nearly all members of the Constitutional Loya Jirga approved the 

draft  Constitution  which  was  signed  and  promulgated  by  President  Karzai  on  26 
January, 2004.29 

Unlike  in  many  other  constitution-making  processes,  the  secretariat  was  not 

immediately disbanded upon adoption of the Constitution.</a></p>
<p><a id="398" name="398">It remained operational for 

three extra months in order to conduct a civic education campaign on the contents of 
the newly adopted constitution.30 

</a></p>
<p><a id="399" name="399">Thus, the Afghan constitution-making process involved the drafting of a Constitution 

by  a  drafting  committee,  civic  education  and  public  consultation  conducted  by  a 

Constitutional Commission, the functioning of a varied 502-member Constitutional 

Assembly (the Loya Jirga), and the operation of an expanded secretariat.</a></p>
<p><a id="400" name="400">Because the 

President and cabinet ultimately and unilaterally determined the Constitution’s final

<p><a id="447" name="447">an agenda of humanitarian and development priorities including support to

Colombia is a unitary, presidential, constitutional republic in South America.</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="461" name="461">Before  the  Constitution  of  1991  was  promulgated  on  4  July  1991,  Colombia  was 

governed by its Constitution of 1886.</a></p>
<p><a id="462" name="462">The Constitution of 1886 became outdated in the 
latter half of the 20th Century and Colombia became engulfed in political violence on 
multiple fronts, especially between the government and guerrilla movements and drug 

cartels.</a></p>
<p><a id="463" name="463">All round, there was a call for political and therefore constitutional reform.</a></p>
<p><a id="464" name="464">

</a></p>
<p><a id="465" name="465">Two referenda were held on the question of whether a ‘constitutional’ assembly should 
be convened to form a new Constitution, both being answered in the affirmative.36 The 

constitutional assembly was thus established, which comprised 70 members elected by 

popular vote.</a></p>
<p><a id="466" name="466">Additionally, some membership slots—although lacking voting rights—

were assigned to demobilised guerrillas.</a></p>

<p><a id="469" name="469">In the process of creating Colombia’s current constitution, there was a great deal of 

constitutional  litigation  and  therefore  a  prominent  role  for  the  Supreme  Court  of 

Justice of Colombia.</a></p>
<p><a id="470" name="470">For example, the Court ruled in 1991 that the restrictions placed 

on  the  enactment  scope  of  the  constitutional  assembly  was  unlawful  since,  in 

exercising the primary constituent power of the people as ultimate popular sovereigns,

These  ethnocentric  forces  were  preoccupied  with  the  nationalities  question  when

to have had a Constitution that was not sensitive to the ethnic question and that in a 

positive  sense,  ethnic  federalism  has  promoted  inclusiveness  with  regard  to  some 
hitherto marginalised groups.56 

Accordingly,  Ethiopia’s  1995  Constitution  was  drafted  by  a  Constitutional 

Commission set up by a Council of Representatives – after extensive consultation of 

experts  but  with  insufficient  public  consultation  –  and  eventually  adopted  by  a

<p><a id="660" name="660">In essence, the government

that  the  constitution  favoured  RPF  interests  and  included  too  many  limitations  on 

freedom of expression and on political parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="675" name="675">The constitution was negotiated in an 

atmosphere of restricted political freedom which has existed since 1994 when the RPF 
entered Kigali.63 

Nevertheless, in the aftermath of a horrific genocide, the participatory constitutional

With the exception of its Kurdistan region,71 most of Iraq was governed under a unitary 
government  before  2003.72  The  2005  Constitution  thus  recognised  Kurdistan  as  a 
federal region, and its government as the valid sub-national authority there.</a></p>
<p><a id="738" name="738">Outside 

Kurdistan, a decentralisation system of governorates was recognised and the potential 
for different governorates to combine and form a region was also included.73 In 2017, 

the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) organised an independence referendum 

in which approximately 93.25% of votes cast were cast in favour of independence from 
Iraq.</a></p>
<p><a id="739" name="739">The federal government of Iraq, however, rejected the referendum’s legality.74 

In 2014, ISIS gained control of over one third of Iraqi territory, raising some questions 
regarding the effectiveness of the Iraq federal government.75 

</a></p>
<p><a id="740" name="740">The United States regarded the establishment of a new Constitution for Iraq, founded 

on democratic principles, as essential to the end of its occupation and therefore the 

restoration of Iraq’s independence.</a></p>
<p><a id="741" name="741">Establishing such a new Constitution was also the 

UN’s objective, and had the endorsement of the UN Security Council.</a></p>
<p><a id="742" name="742">The adoption 
of Iraq’s new Constitution, therefore, became the focus of diplomatic negotiations.76 

The UN, through a Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, mediated between the 

United States administration and the most influential Shia leader, Grand Ayatollah 

Al-Sistani, concerning the constitution-making process.</a></p>
<p><a id="743" name="743">While the United States had 

proposed two alternative methods of making the Constitution, Al-Sistani opposed both 
and insisted on the constitution being made by an elected Assembly.77 The Ayatollah 
finally  agreed  that  after  a  period  of  interim  constitutional  arrangements,  an  elected 

assembly would draft the Constitution before its adoption by way of a referendum.</a></p>

<p><a id="963" name="963">In  this  regard,  the  creation  of  a  federal  government,  which 
consciously shared power amongst the different ethnic groups, was critical.102 

</a></p>
<p><a id="964" name="964">The ethnic feature underlying the government of B&H is unmistakable.</a></p>
<p><a id="965" name="965">For example, 

the Presidency of B&H comprises three persons;</a></p>
<p><a id="966" name="966">a Serb, a Bosniak and a Croat—and 

the Chair of this presidency rotates amongst them every 8 months within their 4 year 
term.103 Additionally, the Council of Ministers, members of which are selected by the 

majority  parties  on  the  basis  of  strictly  defined  ethnic  representation  rules,  has 
executive responsibility for foreign and economic policy amongst</a></p>
<p><a id="967" name="967">other areas.104 

</a></p>
<p><a id="968" name="968">Each entity has its own government which deals with internal matters not overseen by 
the  Council  of  Ministers,  and  their  own  Supreme  Courts  and  lower  courts.105  The 
supreme final court within the country, however, is the Constitutional Court of Bosnia 

and  Herzegovina,  which  has  jurisdiction  over  decisions  made  in  constitutional 
disputes between the entities.106 

The  Bosnian  constitution-making  process  is  instructive.  </a></p>
<p><a id="969" name="969">It  demonstrates  that,  for  a 

constitution  crafted  in  a  peace  agreement,  implementation  requires  ongoing 

negotiation  and  effort,  just  as  the  peace  agreement  does  overall.  </a></p>
<p><a id="970" name="970">The  Dayton 

negotiations did not produce a clear mandate or plan to address lingering obstacles to 

implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="971" name="971">An arbitrarily short and unrealistic deadline to implement the peace 

agreement fully, imposed by the international community, prevented the international 

community from engaging on implementation as creatively and strategically as it could 

have.  </a></p>
<p><a id="972" name="972">This  failure  meant  that  each  step  toward  implementation  required  continual 

renegotiation,  both  within  the  international  community  and  Bosnian  actors. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="973" name="973">Implementation was thus awkward, compromised, and hesitant.107

The 2006 Constitution of the DRC creates a quasi-federal system and recognises four 
national languages that are commonly spoken across the different regions.111 Its quasi-
federal status is a compromise between the federalists and the centralists.112 Federalism 
is controversial in the context of DRC because it is prone to secessionist movements 

(historically, Katanga and contemporarily, the Kongo people in the West and the Hutu 
and Tutsi of the East) and civil wars.113 Provinces can keep up to 40% of their revenues 

including revenues from mineral resources – an  incentive against secession by large

the first coupled with attempts by the Khartoum government to impose Sharia law on 
the  South.125  It  formally  ended  with  the  signature  of  the  Comprehensive  Peace 

Agreement  (CPA)  in  2005,  which  provided  for  the  status  of  South  Sudan  as  an

98% of the votes cast were in favour of South Sudan’s secession.126 

Pursuant to the 1972 Addis Ababa Agreement, Sudan’s Col. Jaafar Nimeiri had also

The Soviet-imposed Constitution of 1952 was to apply until the eventual adoption of 

the  Polish  Constitution  of  1997.  </a></p>
<p><a id="1096" name="1096">The  1997  Constitution  was  developed  by  a 

parliamentary  committee,  adopted  by  Parliament,  and  approved  by  way  of  a 
referendum in 1997.131 

Between  1988  and  1989,  Poland  used  roundtable  arrangements  as  a  model  for 

constitution-making, bringing the term into popular use and influencing the use of the 

same  approach  in  Eastern  Europe,  Latin  America,  and  other  places.  </a></p>
<p><a id="1097" name="1097">With  the 

impending fall of the communist system in Eastern Europe, members of the Polish 

Communist Party saw the strategic importance of negotiating with the opposition as a 

way of obtaining a favourable future, especially since the Communist Party did not 

have the clout to create acceptable changes in the country’s Constitution on its own.</a></p>
<p><a id="1098" name="1098">

</a></p>
<p><a id="1099" name="1099">Initially, the main parties (the Communist Government and a Solidarity trade union 

movement) had over six months of clandestine negotiations about a roundtable, under 

the mediation of the Catholic Church.</a></p>
<p><a id="1100" name="1100">The main roundtable was convened thereafter 

in February 1989 and only met occasionally as most of its work was accomplished by 

committees  and  working  groups.  </a></p>
<p><a id="1101" name="1101">In  April  of  1989,  a  ‘Roundtable  Agreement’  was 
completed.132 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1102" name="1102">The Polish Parliament mostly made moderate amendments to the Constitution, many 

of which were intended to protect the Communists in some respects while enabling the 

participation of the opposition in competitive politics.</a></p>
<p><a id="1103" name="1103">These amendments were made 

just days after the completion of the Roundtable Agreement referred to above.</a></p>
<p><a id="1104" name="1104">

</a></p>
<p><a id="1105" name="1105">Constitutional  changes  made  through  the  Roundtable  process  paved  the  way  for 

further changes, which could be made through more broadly representative entities 

and processes.  </a></p>
<p><a id="1106" name="1106">There were initial attempts to wholly replace the 1952 constitution and 

the  two  chambers  of  the  Polish  Parliament  –  the  Sejm  and  Senate  –  separately 

established  different  committees  in  this  respect  between  1989  and  1991.  </a></p>
<p><a id="1107" name="1107">Each 

committee  developed  its  own  draft  Constitution  without  cooperation.  </a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="1114" name="1114">In April 1992, the Polish Parliament adopted the Constitutional Law on the Procedure 
for Preparing and Enacting the Constitution.133</a></p>
<p><a id="1115" name="1115">This law provided for a Constitutional 

Committee  comprising  members  of  both  the  Sejm  and  the  Senate;</a></p>
<p><a id="1116" name="1116"> </a></p>
<p><a id="1117" name="1117">and  non-voting

<p><a id="1118" name="1118">The 

envisaged process involved the receipt and consideration of proposals, the creation of 

a draft Constitution and deliberations on it by a National Assembly consisting of both 

chambers  of  Parliament;</a></p>

<p><a id="1127" name="1127">The public turn out in the

Constitution.  </a></p>

requirement.</a></p>
<p><a id="1129" name="1129">

</a></p>
<p><a id="1130" name="1130">Thus, Poland’s 1997 Constitution was developed deliberated upon, and adopted by the 

Polish Parliament, and approved by way of a referendum, albeit with a modest turn 

out.</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="1560" name="1560">However, not all disputes can directly be resolved through the process of constitution-

<p><a id="1561" name="1561">In  particular,  certain  military  and  security-related  issues  may  need  to  be 

addressed  separately,  and  before  the  substantive  constitution-making  process.  </a></p>

<p><a id="1581" name="1581">It is also useful for 

this smaller body to serve the Constituent Assembly as a repository and clearing house

the constitutional systems of other countries.137

3.4.  </a></p>
<p><a id="1623" name="1623">Public Participation and ownership 

There  is  a  clear  trend  toward  providing  for  more  direct  and  far-reaching  popular 

participation  in  the  constitution-making  process,  not  only  through  the  election  of  a 

constituent assembly or voting in a referendum on the proposed constitutional text, but 

also in the form of civic education and popular consultation during the development 

of the constitution.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="1624" name="1624">Aspects  of  this  approach  have  been  employed  around  the  world  in  recent  years, 

including in Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Asia.</a></p>
<p><a id="1625" name="1625">This model enables the broader 

public to be actively engaged throughout the process, not merely at the polling centre 

to decide on a constitution that has been crafted completely behind closed doors by a 
small group of elites.142 

In the context of a divided society, especially, the emphasis on public participation in 

the  development  of  the  constitution  can  provide  the  best  possibility  for  vulnerable 

groups, or even those who view themselves as politically disenfranchised, to engage in 

an open national dialogue regarding decisions that are vital to the future direction of 

the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="1626" name="1626">

</a></p>
<p><a id="1627" name="1627">This  approach  can  be  crucial  to  forging  a  common  vision  for  the  nation’s  future, 

resulting  in  a  new  constitution  in  which  all  these  diverse  groups  may  not  have  the 

immediate satisfaction of all their demands, but in which they have a stake and a sense 

of ownership.</a></p>
<p><a id="1628" name="1628">At its core, broad public participation and consultation is most important 

in  developing  an  authentic  sense  that  the  new  constitution  is  not  irrelevant  and 

abstract, or a tool to be used or abused by those in power but, rather, is the possession 
of all the people, who will insist on its implementation.143

</a></p>
<p><a id="1637" name="1637">The first challenge in ensuring that members of the public have an adequate connection 

to the making of their constitution is an effective program of public education.</a></p>
<p><a id="1638" name="1638">This 

public  education  phase  provides  an  important  vehicle  to  broadly  disseminate 

information on the constitution and the constitutional process, and information on the 

basic themes that should inform the new constitutional framework.</a></p>
<p><a id="1639" name="1639">In some countries, 

the  public  education  campaign  has  served  as  a  stimulus  for  civil  society  groups  to 
organize public discussions.144 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1640" name="1640">Generally,  such  campaigns  involve  providing  information  to  the  public  through 

television  and  radio  advertisements  and  programs;</a></p>

dissemination of informational materials through schools, and the use of other media 

forms.</a></p>
<p><a id="1647" name="1647">In certain countries, a great deal has also been learned about how to conduct 

these campaigns with a largely illiterate population through the use of radio, cartoons, 

and traveling theatrical presentations.</a></p>
<p><a id="1648" name="1648">

</a></p>
<p><a id="1649" name="1649">In some cases, constitutional commissions have tried to conduct civic education and 

popular  consultation  all  in  one  phase,  but  experience  suggests  that  they  should  be 
treated as two distinct phases of the process.145 In East Timor, for instance, the public 

education  and  consultation  phases  were  conflated,  arguably  weakening  the 

effectiveness of each.</a></p>
<p><a id="1650" name="1650">South Africa, Eritrea, and Rwanda are more successful examples 

of this aspect of the process, whereby a carefully planned program of civic education 

was  conducted  to  educate  the  population  on  the  role  of  a  constitution  in  society 

generally and their role in constitution making.</a></p>
<p><a id="1651" name="1651">Albania also provides a very useful 

model of a robust and well-organized public education and consultation process, which 
has arguably strengthened the drive toward democratization in that country.146

was broadcast as a three-part program on Albanian state television, brought together

hundreds of suggestions from the public regarding changes to the draft constitution,

submitted to a public referendum.147

<p><a id="1662" name="1662">Linking Consultation to Drafting 

The synthesis of the results of popular consultation into the constitutional draft requires 

proper  planning,  which  has  been  a  challenge  in  certain  cases.  </a></p>
<p><a id="1663" name="1663">In  East  Timor,  for 

example,  the  Constituent  Assembly  focused  on  a  draft  prepared  by  the  dominant

<p><a id="1672" name="1672"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1673" name="1673">In some countries, domestic and international pressures have rushed the process, with 

disappointing  results.  </a></p>
<p><a id="1674" name="1674">This  was  the  case  in  East  Timor,  where  the  effort  at  public 

consultation took only one month.</a></p>

public  consultation  but,  again,  allocated  too  little  time  for  the  exercise.  </a></p>
<p><a id="1676" name="1676">In  the 

Cambodian  case,  also,  it  appears  that  the  rushed  1993  constitution-making  process 
contributed to the weakness of the country’s government.148 

An effective public education and consultation process will generally take at least a 

year;</a></p>
<p><a id="1677" name="1677">and some countries have allocated as many as three years to public engagement.</a></p>
<p><a id="1678" name="1678">

</a></p>
<p><a id="1679" name="1679">A  compressed  schedule  for  constitution  making  necessarily  obliges  constitution 

drafters to carry out their task without the benefit of meaningful public consultation 

and input, risking a public that is less familiar with, and invested in, the resulting new 

constitutional  order.  </a></p>
<p><a id="1680" name="1680">Recognizing  that  more  time  was  needed  to  maximize  public 

engagement and the legitimacy of the process, various countries found it necessary, 

during their constitution-making efforts, to revise previously established deadlines for 

the completion of constitution drafting or for the holding of a public referendum on 
the final constitution.149

<p><a id="1681" name="1681">Democratic Representation 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1682" name="1682">In  addition  to  public  participation,  an  important  factor  for  the  legitimacy  of  the 

constitution and the stability of the system it establishes is democratic representation 

in the constitutional commission, which may take the lead on drafting;</a></p>

<p><a id="1697" name="1697">A boycott of the constitutional

<p><a id="1702" name="1702">Party Drafting versus Consensus Drafting 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1703" name="1703">In many cases, the tabling of a constitutional draft early in the process, particularly by 

a powerful party, becomes the focus of most debate and discussion.</a></p>
<p><a id="1704" name="1704">In East Timor, for 

example,  the  FRETILIN  party  circulated  a  proposed  draft  even  before  the 

constitution-making  process  was  formally  initiated.  </a></p>
<p><a id="1705" name="1705">In  Cambodia,  King  Norodom 

Sihanouk commissioned a French expert to prepare his draft of the constitution very 

early  in  the  process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="1706" name="1706">From  the  moment  that  draft  was  prepared,  it  became  more 

difficult for other participants to make their views heard or to propose alternatives, 

because  there  was  a  tendency  to  reduce  all  issues  to  the  question  of  whether  the 
alternatives were consistent with the King’s draft.153 

The disadvantage that stems from the early establishment of drafts by powerful parties 

or individuals is that the approach of the particular draft tends to frame and skew what

would otherwise be a more open-minded consultation and drafting effort.154 One way 

to minimize this negative effect is to establish a constitutional commission with broad 

political support to explore each constitutional question anew, and to ensure that the 

public has the opportunity to be heard on all constitutional issues — not merely those 
raised in particular drafts or proposed by dominant groups.155 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1720" name="1720">In these circumstances, the constitutional commission can serve as the repository of 

all drafts and other submissions from all parties and individuals.</a></p>
<p><a id="1721" name="1721">The commission can 

then take those drafts and submissions into consideration, along with the results of the 

popular consultation;</a></p>
<p><a id="1722" name="1722">and synthesize all those elements in a consolidated draft, or a 

set of options, which can then be prepared for submission to the National Assembly 

for debate.</a></p>
<p><a id="1723" name="1723">This approach can avoid the focus on individual ready-made drafts and the 

power associated with any particular faction, and provide a greater opportunity to all 
groups in the society to express their views on constitutional issues.156

<p><a id="1724" name="1724">The Role of the International Community and Experts 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1725" name="1725">The  international  community  can  play  a  beneficial  role  in  the  constitution-making 

process and, in some cases, can be crucial to its success.</a></p>
<p><a id="1726" name="1726">For example, a number of the 

programmes of civic education and popular consultation described in the selected case 

studies  could  not  have  been  conducted  without  the  financial  support  of  the 

international community.</a></p>
<p><a id="1727" name="1727">In addition, international constitutional experts can serve 
as a valuable human resource developing and drafting constitutions.157 

On  the  other  hand,  international  involvement  can  be  problematic.  </a></p>
<p><a id="1728" name="1728">For  instance, 

members of the international community have in some cases favoured a political party 

to serve their own pragmatic interests, either viewing it as expedient to develop good 

working relations with the party that will obviously hold power once the process is 

completed,  or  favouring  parties  that  are  most  sympathetic  to  a  particular  foreign 

power’s  own  interests.  </a></p>

Although this model raises questions regarding the extent to which the constituent

<p><a id="1761" name="1761">it 

is one which is critical for the framing of accepted parameters within which the makers

The  assignment  of  the  Constitution-making  process  to  a  democratically  elected

emerging practice.</a></p>
<p><a id="1765" name="1765"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1766" name="1766">In addition, the case studies show that the use of national conferences and fora, such

<p><a id="1768" name="1768">Further, the presentation of final constitutional drafts to the public for approval in a

During the making of Colombia’s 1991 Constitution, extensive litigation before the 

Supreme Court of Justice resolved key legal controversies.</a></p>
<p><a id="1797" name="1797">For example, the Court 

ruled in 1990 that the restrictions placed on the enactment scope of the constitutional

people as ultimate popular sovereigns, the constitutional assembly could not be so 
limited.163 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1798" name="1798">The possibility of judicial oversight over a constitution-making process achieves two 

unique purposes:</a></p>
<p><a id="1799" name="1799">i) it incorporates, at an early stage, a crucial role for the judicial arm

<p><a id="1800" name="1800"> </a></p>
<p><a id="1801" name="1801">and  ii)  it  enables  a  draft

enacted as the new Constitution.</a></p>
<p><a id="1805" name="1805">In others, it still has to be adopted by the public in a 

referendum.  </a></p>
<p><a id="1806" name="1806">The  latter  approach  appears  to  be  a  more  useful  means  of  building

<p><a id="1810" name="1810">Where the process is rushed by the authorities (such as the 

East Timorese process), proper consultation and education of the public are sacrificed 

– thereby risking the national acceptance and longevity of the adopted Constitution.</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="1812" name="1812">In addition, in cases where constitution-building occurs in the immediate aftermath 

of an armed conflict, it is important to separate, as much as possible, the conclusion 

of the peace agreement from the making of a final or permanent constitution.</a></p>
<p><a id="1813" name="1813">The 

emerging  trend  is  to  have  interim  or  transitional  constitutions  which  apply 

immediately after the conclusion of an armed conflict and long enough for the country

</a></p>
<p><a id="1828" name="1828">This is difficult, especially where the country is under foreign occupation (Afghanistan
