3.0    29 October —  November:</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">Abduction and rape of women.

</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">•</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">The  women abducted from the Catholic Church compound were ordered by their
captors to carry wounded SPLM/A-IO soldiers from Bentiu to Guit County.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">This they
did, and that night and on the subsequent two nights they were raped by SPLM/A-IO
soldiers in turns.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Each woman was raped by at least eight men.

</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">•</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">When they reached Nyieng Muok Puok (sic), which was described by one of the
victims as an SPLM/A-IO base, they were released on the orders of Brigadier General
James Liah Din (sic).

</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">•</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">Five of them returned to Bentiu on  November but the other four could not return with
them because of the injuries and fatigue they had sustained due to being abused and
raped.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">It is not known what happened to them afterwards, but witnesses suggested
they would follow when they had recovered.

</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">•</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">There were other unconfirmed reports that more women had been abducted, but at
time of writing the MVT had found no further information about this.

3.1     29 October 2014:</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Killing of civilians — women and children:</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">


</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">IGAD JTC MVM

•</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">During the period when the SPLM/A-IO were in temporary control of Bentiu several
SPLM/A-IO soldiers broke into the house of a women in Der Block and killed her -
month old baby and then her.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">The killings were particularly brutal.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">The woman was a
mother of five whose other children were in the POC Camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">The killing was witnessed
by the woman’s sister who was in the next door house.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">

</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">•</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">The soldiers then broke into the sisters house and killed another woman before
leaving because one said that they had killed one sister and should not kill the other.

</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">•</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">The attack left two women — both mothers — and one baby dead.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">The MVT visited the
site of the killing (coordinates:</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">N 09° 15.0’;</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">E 29° 47.0’)

3.0     Assessment

•</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">The MVT was able to interview a suitable number of credible witnesses during its
investigation, and access a great deal of information.

</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">•</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">The motive of the killing of civilians seems to be to punish the Nuer families who had
“betrayed” the Nuer community by accepting to live within Bentiu town under control of
the Government.

</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">•</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">The JTC found the abduction of civilians who sought refuge at a place of worship
particularly shocking.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">Such places of worship are protected under the law of armed
conflict.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">

</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">•</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">It is the view of the JTC that these incident certainly did happen, and that they
represent a serious violation of the COHA as well as International Human rights law
and the Law of Armed Conflict by SPLM/A-IO Forces.

</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">4.0  Conclusion

4.1      As a result of investigations, and the weight of evidence collated, it is the opinion of the
JTC that SPLM/A-IO Forces violated the following articles of the Cessation of Hostilities
