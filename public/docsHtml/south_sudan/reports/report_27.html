Executive Summary
CTSAMM continues to monitor the security situation in South Sudan in particular with
regard to the provisions of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (COHA).
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">The period can be characterised as being relatively quiet, however while there may
have been relatively few outbreaks of ceasefire-related violence this does not translate
into a period of peace and stability.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">Acts of criminality, intercommunal fighting and
random attacks by unknown armed groups are increasing
Fighting between the Parties continues throughout large areas of the country.

<p><a id="17" name="17">Combined with increased levels of intercommunal fighting and widespread criminality
the country continues to present a dire security situation.

<p><a id="24" name="24">The International Observers conduct routine patrols in the local vicinity of their
bases and more sustained patrols by air or vehicle to gather information and
conduct investigations where appropriate.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">MVTs have a network of contacts
to assist in gathering information which include, Civil Society Organisations,
state level government sources, media outlets, and through interaction with
civilians and soldiers in their areas of operation.

provide early warning of potential fighting and other incidents.</a></p>

findings for the period August to September 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">

2.0  Findings
2.1  Overall Security Assessment.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">While there is no recognised baseline for security,
the period can be characterised as being relatively quiet.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">Unfortunately, while
there may have been relatively few outbreaks of ceasefire-related violence this
.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">does not translate into a period of peace and stability.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">As of  October, there are
over 1.0  million IDPs (http:/Awww.unocha.org/south-sudan), and 1.1  million South

Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries, the majority of whom cite hunger

and insecurity as the reasons for relocation.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">Acts of criminality, intercommunal

“fighting and random attacks by unknown armed groups are increasing.
</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">Recruitment of male youth by the armed forces continues, and as ever the brunt
of the violence falls upon those vulnerable groups of women, children and the
elderly who have little recourse but to flee from the violence.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">

2.0  Upper Nile State.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">For the period covered in this report there were MVTs

were conducted to the locations shown below.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">Multiple attempts have been made
to conduct a joint patrol with UNMISS to PAGAK during September but to date
Flight Safety Assurance has not been granted.</a></p>

work of agencies delivering HA was severely disrupted.</a></p>

staff relocated to Bentiu from surrounding areas southwest of Bentiu.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">It is
likely there were civilian casualties as a result of fighting in NHIALDHU, and
several NGOs also reportedly relocated on 18 September due to insecurity
caused by the warring Parties.</a></p>

<p><a id="130" name="130">3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">CTSAMM Monitoring indicates clearly that the provisions of the
PCTSA continue to be ignores by all Parties in large areas of the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">There
are signs of improvement in some areas, but overall the security situation
remains dire and the people of South Sudan continue to suffer as a result.

4.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">

</a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">4.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">Fighting between parties continue throughout large areas of the country.
</a></p>
<p><a id="136" name="136">Combined with increased levels of intercommunal fighting and widespread
criminality the country continues to present a dire security situation.

4.2  All parties should commit to stopping the killing, wounding and threatening of
innocent civilians as ‘collateral damage’.</a></p>
<p><a id="137" name="137">

4.3  Freedom of movement:</a></p>
<p><a id="138" name="138">Access is difficult enough due to road conditions and the
wet season, but the deliberate impediment of MVT Patrols in Upper Nile and
Eastern Equatoria by the Parties is particularly frustrating and unacceptable.

</a></p>
<p><a id="139" name="139">4.4  Lack of effective liaison with SPLA-IO (RM) remains a considerable obstacle to
CTSAMM operations and particularly to the effective investigation of PCTSA
violations.</a></p>
<p><a id="140" name="140">

4.5  </a></p>
<p><a id="141" name="141">The lack of sufficient UNMISS Force Protection resources is proving a significant
impediment to the operations of MVT’s.</a></p>
<p><a id="142" name="142">CTSAMM should be able to respond to
incidents in a timely manner, but too often it takes a long time to coordinate with
UNMISS whose resources are stretched.</a></p>
