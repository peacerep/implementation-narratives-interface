|

|

|          Under article 2.1.8  of the R-ARCSS, the Parties agreed to “cease security forces
|          recruitment and training”.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">Any recruitment would not only be in violation of article
           2.2.8  but also those other provisions such as article 2.3.10.0, 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0.1,
               2.0.10.0.4  among others.

</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">In June 2022, CTSAMVM received information about alleged recruitment and
|              training of youth in Tambura.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">The allegation was that Captain Philips Knamis of NSS
|          wanted to increase the number of NSS personnel following the loss of significant
               numbers of personnel through desertion.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">|           CTSAMVM confirmed that there is ongoing NSS training currently being conducted
|         in different locations such as Mamenze across the river, around  km south of

<p><a id="14" name="14">The

Training was authorized by the NSS HQ, State and County authorities.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">Captain

|               (NSS) IN TAMBURA COUNTY, WESTERN EQUATORIA STATE.
</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">|           Introduction

, Background

a. Under article 2.0.8  of the R-ARCSS, the Parties agreed to “cease security
forces recruitment and training”.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">Any recruitment and training of new recruits
would not only be in violation of article 2.1.8  but also those other provisions
such as article 2.2.10.0, 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0.1, 2.0.10.0.4  among others.

b. Since the signing of the ACoH, CTSAMVM has received many allegations of
forced recruitment by the Parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">It has always been a challenging issue to
investigate.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">The Parties are unwilling to cooperate and too often witnesses
unwilling to talk to CTSAMVM for fear of reprisals.

</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">c. During 2020 there were allegations of forced recruitment in Unity State,
specifically in the Bentiu/Rubkona areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">CTSAMVM _ undertook an
investigation but was unable to find any evidence of forced recruitment in the
mentioned areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">SSPDF commanders told CTSAMVM that it was not
recruitment but bringing back to units “deserters” or soldiers who had left
SSPDF and returned to their villages.

d. Between 2021 and 2022 CTSAMVM continued to receive allegations of
recruitment in the Bentiu/Rubkona areas, and in particular in the IDP camps.
</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">On 25 January 2022, the Bentiu IDF Youth Forum issued a press statement
condemning “rampant” arrest of young people by the armed forces.

</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">•. In September 2021 CTSAMVM received allegations from the SPLM/A-IO that
the SSPDF was training “new recruits” in Digala.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">CTSAMVM was unable to
get access to Digala, and indeed on  February 2022 was turned back at
gunpoint (CTSAMVM Report 2022/06).                 </a></p>

f. On 22 September 2021,  SSPDF soldiers deserted the SSPDF camp at
Nasir and were held by the SPLM/A-IO in Ulang.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">They all claimed to have
been forcibly recruited by the SSPDF in Lakes State.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">The deserters remained
|                      in Ulang under the SPLMW/A-IO until the end of January 2022 when they were
                        reportedly sent back home by the SPLM/A-IO authorities.
</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">|           2. Allegations
|                 a. In June 2022, CTSAMVM MVT Yambio received an allegation on recruitment
and training of youth in Tambura by Captain Philips Khamis an officer in
charge of South Sudan National Security Services (NSS).</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">It was alleged that
                 one Captain Philips Khamis started recruitment of the youth in Tambura to
increase the number of NSS personnel and to replace those that were lost
through desertion.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">It was further alleged that NSS lost a significant number of
personnel through desertion thus the reason for Captain Philips Khamis to
|              decide to start recruiting and training the youths in Tambura in order to
mitigate the personnel gaps.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">Training of these new recruits was allegedly
being conducted in the vicinity of Tambura Hospital along Sue road and the
area close to the Paramount Chief's residence.
</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">b. Consequently, the Tambura County Local Authorities reportedly asked
Captain Philips to provide documentation from the Revitalised Transitional
Government of National Unity (RTGoNU) authorizing such recruitment and
training activities in the area.
</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">3.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">Aim</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">:</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">The aim of this report is to present the findings of CTSAMVM investigations
into allegations of recruitment and training by the National Security Service in
Tambura County.

<p><a id="41" name="41">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">
a. CTSAMVM MVT Yambio conducted a Dynamic Air Patrol on 16 Jun 22 and
later a Long Duration Patrol to Tambura between 27 June - 01 July 2022.

b. CTSAMVM interviewed a range of witnesses on 16 June 2022 and from

28 — 30 June 2022, including:</a></p>

<p><a id="50" name="50">Leaders and members of IDP Camps in Tambura

|         c. The standard of proof used by CTSAMVM to determine whether there is
sufficient evidence to verify that a Party is not in compliance with the
provisions of the Agreements is “reasonable grounds to believe that the

|          incident that is the subject of the investigation occurred.”</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">This is in

|               accordance with accepted practice for monitoring mechanisms and human

|                      rights and humanitarian entities and signifies that sufficient facts and evidence

|                      have been collected to conclude that an event has occurred.

<p><a id="53" name="53">

|       5.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">The political and security situation in Tambura County has not normalised

|             because of the disagreements between the State and County leadership.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">The

|             Deputy Governor instructed people to keep staying in the IDP camps because

|             fighting is still expected while the County Commissioner requested them to go
back to their homes.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">These contradictions have kept civilians in a state of fear
and uncertainty.
</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">|          6.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">There is ongoing NSS training currently being conducted in different locations
|             such as Mamenze across the river, around  km south of Tambura and areas
                  close to the Airfield where the NSS Barracks is located.
7.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">The Training was authorized by the State Government authorities, the NSS HQ
            and County authorities.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">Captain Phillips Khamis (NSS) started the recruitment
drive around 16 May 2022 in Tambura.
</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">|              8.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">Senior State officials alluded that the program was supposedly to train a cadre of
youth to replace deserters from their operations in Tambura.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">However, there
         were differing reports on the training site, with some saying that it is in
                Matakurungu near the home of the Tambura Paramount Chief while others said
that it is near Tambura Hospital.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">There were also differing reports of the
              composition of the trainees, with some alleging that they were all Zande whilst
                    others claim that they were a mix of Balanda, Zande, Dinka and Jur.
9.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">The training includes the former NSS agents who have been working with the
                 Service for  years to be nominated to join NSS and new recruits to increase the
|                     numbers of personnel.
</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">|        10.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">Captain Philips Khamis told CTSAMVM that the training includes the NSS
                 soldiers who defected or deserted to other areas during the conflicts, indiscipline
                    soldiers and active soldiers to raise their capabilities and readiness.
11.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">CTSAMVM confirmed from relatives of the recruits on training that there are
                   some underage children who were recruited and joined training.
12.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">There are child soldiers who had joined Maj Gen James Nando during the
Tambura conflict but did not go through the screening process.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">They have
uniforms obtained from Maridi TC which resemble NSS uniform.</a></p>

soldiers donning NSS looking uniforms have become a source of threat inside the
IDP Camps.

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">One of the Paramount Chiefs confirmed to have attended a meeting in March
              2022 together with other local chiefs and headmen from both sides of Azande
               and Balanda, chaired by the County Commissioner.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">The commissioner informed
                 them about the new recruitment for those who were willing to join NSS basing on
|                   the request by NSS.

<p><a id="75" name="75">The security situation in Tambura has improved and the people move freely.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">Very
               few people are still in Hayat IDP Camp especially those who came from remote
|             areas.

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">There are under age children among the recruits on training as confirmed by
|           some of the parents.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">CTSAMVM did not confirm whether there was forced

recruitment of these children.

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">The security situation in WES including Tambura is politically motivated.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">The
              people of Tambura especially those in IDP camps are confused by the
              contradicting instructions given to them by the State and County leaders
|                      belonging to different Party Signatories.
</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">|         17.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">There was deliberate effort by Captain Philips Khamis to interrupt and deny
|           CTSAMVM access to information claiming that the MVT had undermined his
|                authority by being in his AOR without his knowledge.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">However, this was not true
|              because all the necessary communications and arrangements had been earlier
|           done by the National Monitors.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">This was an unfortunate incident deliberately
|
                   intended to deny information to CTSAMVM in the fulfilment of its mandate.
