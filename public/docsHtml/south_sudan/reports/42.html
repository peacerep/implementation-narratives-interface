CTSAMM REPORT NUMBER 022
VIOLATIONS IN JUBA
Executive Summary

On the evening of 15 June 2016, in two separate but related incidents, Government
National Security Service (NSS) personnel attacked personnel of the Office of the
(then) First Vice President (FVP).</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">They were not provoked in any way.</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">These
incidents were initially reported to this forum at the last CTSAMM meeting in June
2016 when an interim report was presented.
</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">In the first incident, armed NSS personnel halted a motor vehicle and apprehended its
sole occupant, a Protocol Driver for the FVP.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">After confiscating his pistol, ammunition,
and cellular phones, NSS officials tied, blindfolded, and beat him.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">They then took him
to an unknown location where they continued beating him and threatened to kill him.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">The second incident involved another FVP Protocol motor vehicle, in this instance
carrying two occupants.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">NSS soldiers fired approximately six rounds of automatic-
weapons fire at this second vehicle after its driver failed to comply with their orders to
pull over as it was driving past the first vehicle that had already been halted by NSS.
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">The results of investigations indicate that Government Forces NSS soldiers inflicted
unprovoked and gratuitous violence upon personnel operating and occupying Protocol
vehicles assigned to the Office of the SPLM/A-IO FVP.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">These acts of violence against
officials of the FVP were wholly unjustified under any reasonable interpretation of the
circumstances.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">It is the opinion of the CTSAMM that the NSS officers involved in these
incidents acted in violation of the PCTSA.

VIOLATIONS IN JUBA

•</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">Upon receipt of the allegations the CTSAMM Chief of Staff issued a verbal
task order to MVT Juba to conduct an investigation into the alleged
incidents.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">MVT Juba immediately coordinated with the Juba Joint
Operations Centre (JOC) and obtained a copy of its 16 June 2016 report
entitled, “JOC’s Permanent Secretariat Ordinary Meeting.”

•</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">On 16 June, MVT Juba conferred with the Director of the JOC who initiated

with the Chief of Operations & Security Division, NSS HQ Internal Security
Bureau, to discuss the incidents.

      </a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">Violations of the PCTSA

2.0  At 2020 on 15 June 2016, personnel of the Government’s NSS halted an FVP
Protocol vehicle and — after confiscating his weapon and cellular phones — tied,
blindfolded, and beat the driver.

2.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">_</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">_ NSS personnel then placed the Protocol driver into another vehicle and drove
him to an unknown location where they continued to beat him and threatened
him to kill him on the grounds that he was “a rebel.”

2.2.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">At 2040 on 15 June, armed NSS officials fired approximately six rounds of
automatic-weapons fire at a second FVP Protocol vehicle occupied by two
Officials driving back to SPLM/A-IO Site 1.

3.     </a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">Assessment
3.0  MVT Juba conducted a comprehensive investigation that confirmed the
accuracy of the entry in the Juba JOC’s “Permanent Secretariat Ordinary
Meeting” of 16 June 2016:</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">“tension reported to have been caused as a result of
shooting by NSS Personnel on a vehicle belonging to the HQs of the FVP ...
3.1  The incidents of the evening of 15 June 2016 did take place and can only be
characterised as unprovoked assaults by Government NSS personnel upon
Protocol vehicles occupied by officials assigned to the FVP.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">Such actions
violate the PCTSA.
     Conclusion
4.0‘It is the opinion of CTSAMM that Government NSS personnel violated the
PCTSA when in separate but related incidents they gratuitously and without
justification Inflicted bodily harm and mental distress on the driver of one
Protocol vehicle, then Improperly used deadly force by firing at least six
automatic rounds at a second Protocol vehicle occupied by two other members
of the Office of the FVP.
</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">4.1|The Government violated Chapter II of the ARCSS, particularly:</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">
•</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">Article 1.0:</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">“The warring parties shall refrain from prohibited actions outlined
in the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement of 23" January 2014 [including] . . .
</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">1.1.4.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">Offensive, provocative or retaliatory actions such as .. . re-
deployment and movement of forces and any other activities that may
jeopardise this Agreement.”</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">[Emphasis added.]</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">Article 1.2:</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">“The warring parties shall disseminate the provisions of this
Agreement to all forces under their command or influence, and allies, to
ensure compliance upon signing.”

5.0  Observations and Recommendations

5.1  Distribution of Agreements and Training.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">The improper behaviour of NSS
personnel involved in these incidents demonstrates the Government has failed
to effectively disseminate the requirements of the ARCSS and COH
agreements and to properly train the forces under its influence and control.

5.2  Members of the security forces who act improperly should be held to account.
</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">CTSAMM would like to express concern that members of NSS appear to be
able to act with impunity.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">This is not the case — they are subject to both
national and international law in the same way as other security services.

6.0  Comments made by Government representatives at CTSAMM meeting

6.1  At the CTSAMM meeting which took place on 25 January 2017 the
Government representatives wanted to make it clear that these incidents
should be seen in the context of what happened in J1 on July  2016, and that
these incidents should be considered together.

6.2  The Government representatives went on to say that these issues should be
dealt with by JMEC and actions taken “at the political and strategic level”.
