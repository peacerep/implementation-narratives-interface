Executive Summary 

</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">This report on the status of implementation of the Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution 
of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) has been prepared pursuant to article 
7.9 of  the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">The report covers the period from 1 April to 30 June 2022 and builds on 
the previous Quarterly Report No. 014/22.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">Overall, progress made by the Revitalised Transitional 
Government  of  National  Unity  (RTGoNU),  during  the  second  quarter  of  2022,  in  the 
implementation of the R-ARCSS, has been extremely slow.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">During this quarter the most notable 
progress  was  made  with  the  operationalisation  of  the  state  assemblies,  the  unification  of  the 
command  structure  of  the  Necessary  Unified  Forces  (NUF),  and  the  completion  of  public 
consultations on the Commission for Truth Reconciliation and Healing (CTRH).</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">As in the previous quarter, the Transitional National Legislature (TNL) have failed to enact 
the Constitution Making Process Bill, and continues to delay enactment of several security related 
bills.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">Since resuming its work in May 2022 the National Constitutional Amendment Committee 
has submitted two bills to the ministry of Justice, namely the National Audit Chamber Bill and 
the Public Finance Management Bill.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">During the period under review the RJMEC Leadership met 
with  the  Council  of  Ministers  and  offered  several  recommendations  on  improving  the  pace  of 
implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Key among the recommendations is the need for the RTGoNU 
to provide additional resources to the peace process and to complete a roadmap, which provides a 
clear path to the holding of elections.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">The  Permanent  Ceasefire  largely  continued  to  hold  among  the  signatory  parties  to  the 
Agreement.  </a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">However,  tensions  remain  high  between  Sudan  Peoples’  Liberation  Army-In 
Opposition  (SPLA-IO)  forces  and  South  Sudan  Peoples  Defence  Forces  (SSPDF)  or  defectors 
aligned with the South Sudan Peoples’ Defence Forces (SSPDF) as well as local youths in Upper 
Nile  and  Unity  States.  </a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">In  the  face  of  mounting  intercommunal  violence  and  growing  cases  of 
sexual and gender based violence,  Courts Martial set up by the SSPDF resulted in the convictions 
and sentencing of a number of soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">

</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">The  humanitarian  situation  continues  to  be  severely  impacted  by  cuts  to  funding,  low 
agricultural production in several areas, global price increases affecting the cost of fuel, food and 
services,  low  and  unpaid  salaries,  and  long  term  flooding.  </a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">These  impacts  continue  to  sustain 
displacement  and  inhibit  the  re-establishment  of  food  security.  </a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">In  addition,  intercommunal 
violence continues to result into displacement, death, and sexual and gender based violence.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">All 
these  factors  continue  to  stress  host  communities,  returnees  and  Internally  Displaced  Persons 
(IDPs) and are cited to contribute towards the upsurge in criminality across the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">During this quarter, the government completed payment of US $3.03 billion to Sudan as part 
of a Financial Transfer Agreement signed between the countries at South Sudan’s independence. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">The RTGoNU also launched its National Development Strategy focused on building the resilience 
of the people, communities and institutions.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">Meanwhile the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional 
Affairs has started to prepare the legislation that will lay the groundwork for the CTRH after the 
conduct of public consultations.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">In  an  effort  to  increase  the  pace  of  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS,  the  report  therefore 

offers the following recommendations to the RTGoNU, TNL, and IGAD.

<p><a id="111" name="111">This  report  on  the  status  of  implementation  of  the  Revitalised  Agreement  on  the 
Resolution  of  the  Conflict  in  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan  (R-ARCSS)  has  been  prepared

<p><a id="112" name="112">The report covers the period from 1 April to 30 June 
2022 and builds on the previous quarterly Report No. 014/22.1</a></p>

progress or lack thereof in the implementation of the tasks of the R-ARCSS during the reporting 
period,  highlights  challenges  facing  the  implementation,  provide  some  observations  and 
concludes with recommendations to key stakeholders.</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">The report draws  from various sources 
of information including from the Agreement institutions and mechanisms, meetings of the six 
Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (RJMEC) Working Committees, 
and RJMEC monthly plenaries.  
2.      </a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">With barely 8 months left to the end of the current transition, the R-ARCSS is at a critical 
juncture.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">The future of the R-ARCSS shall hang in the balance unless the Unity Government of 
South Sudan acts swiftly and develops a clear roadmap and strategy with timelines on how it 
intends  to  implement  the  outstanding  tasks  of  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">The  critical  outstanding  tasks 
include  the  unification  of  forces  and  their  redeployment,  the  making  of  the  permanent 
constitution, and the start of the elections process, to pave the way for the holding of free, fair 
and credible elections. 
3.     </a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">The persistent cause of the delays in the implementation of the provisions of the R-ARCSS 
range from insufficient political will from the leadership of the parties;</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">4.     Having identified the challenges facing the implementation of the R-ARCSS, the Interim 
RJMEC  Chairperson  met  with  the  Revitalized  Transitional  Government  of  National  Unity 
</a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">(RTGoNU)  Council  of  Ministers  and  made  several  recommendations,  which  if  adopted  will 
help increase the pace of implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">Among the several recommendations proposed was 
for the RTGoNU to:</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">(</a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">i) develop a clear strategy with timelines for the implementation of the critical 
outstanding  tasks  of  the  Agreement;</a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135"> </a></p>
<p><a id="136" name="136">(ii)  reconstitute  the  various  insitiutions  and  commissions  at  the 
national level;</a></p>
<p><a id="137" name="137">(</a></p>
<p><a id="138" name="138">iii) make financial resources available for the completion of the Transitional Security 
Arrangements, and for the DDR Commission to conduct its work;</a></p>
<p><a id="139" name="139">(iv) fast track the establishment of the 
Board of the Special Reconstruction Fund and engage with IGAD, the AU, and the UN on the convening

<p><a id="141" name="141">Section  I,  the  introduction, 
provides  an  overview  of  the  entire  report  and  highlights  the  main  issues  addressed.  </a></p>

<p><a id="150" name="150">Overall, progress in the implementation of the provisions of chapter I of the R-ARCSS has 
been rather slow during this quarter but additional progress was made in the establishment of 
government structures at the state level.</a></p>
<p><a id="151" name="151">To date nine of the ten State Legislative Assemblies 
have been operationalised.2 
 

a.  Council of Ministers 

7.     </a></p>
<p><a id="152" name="152">The Council of Ministers of the RTGoNU met regularly to address matters related to the 
implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS  during  this  reporting  period.  </a></p>
<p><a id="153" name="153">On  8  April  2022,  RJMEC 
leadership briefed the Council on the status of the implementation of the R-ARCSS, which was 
24 months since the formation of the RTGoNU, 41 months since the R-ARCSS was signed, and 
11 months to the end of the Transitional Period. 
8.    </a></p>
<p><a id="154" name="154">During the briefing, the RJMEC requested the Council of Ministers to review the status of 
the implementation of the R-ARCSS and to develop a clear roadmap with a timeline to the end 
of the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="155" name="155">The RTGoNU roadmap should be consensus based, adopted within 
the framework of the R-ARCSS and should also be based on concrete, verifiable timelines, with 
clear  benchmarks  for  progress.  </a></p>
<p><a id="156" name="156">It  is  encouraging  that  the  Council  agreed,  among  others,  to 
reactivate the high-level committee of the Parties on responsibility sharing to deal with related 
matters.

<p><a id="157" name="157">b.  Transitional National Legislative Assembly and Council of States 

9.     </a></p>
<p><a id="158" name="158">In  May  2022,  the  RJMEC  Secretariat  conducted  a  series  of  R-ARCSS  orientation 
workshops  for  the  members  of  the  reconstituted  Transitional  National  Legislative  Assembly 
(TNLA)  on  the  content  of  the  R-ARCSS,  its  status  of  implementation  and  what  the  national 
legislature  can  do  to  facilitate  its  expeditious  implementation.  </a></p>
<p><a id="159" name="159">The  workshops  also  provided 
opportunities for enhancing institutional collaboration between the RJMEC and the TNLA.

<p><a id="442" name="442">However, progress in this regard has been impeded

<p><a id="447" name="447">Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission 

62.  </a></p>
<p><a id="448" name="448">Pursuant  to  its  mandate  of  monitoring  and  overseeing  the  implementation  of  the  R-
ARCSS and the mandate and tasks of the RTGoNU, and also in line with article 7.9 of the R-
ARCSS, the RJMEC Interim Chairperson provided a thorough briefing to the RTGoNU Council 
of Ministers.</a></p>
<p><a id="449" name="449">The Interim Chairperson urged the Council to continue to pursue implementation of the 
R-ARCSS in view of the pending end of the Transitional Period on 23 February 2023.</a></p>
<p><a id="450" name="450">In that regard 
the Chair highlighted key pending election-related tasks under the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="451" name="451">They include, among 
others:</a></p>
<p><a id="452" name="452">(i) the making of the permanent constitution upon whose provision elections will be conducted;</a></p>
<p><a id="453" name="453">
</a></p>
<p><a id="454" name="454">(ii) unification and redeployment of the NUF;</a></p>
<p><a id="455" name="455">(iii) reconstitution of the Political Parties Council;</a></p>
<p><a id="456" name="456">(iv) 
amendment of the National Elections Act, 2012 to conform to the terms of the Peace Agreement and 
reconstitution of a competent and impartial National Elections Commission (NEC) to conduct elections;</a></p>
<p><a id="457" name="457">
</a></p>
<p><a id="458" name="458">(v)  addressing  of  the  challenges  of  reconstruction,  repatriation,  resettlement,  rehabilitation  and 
reintegration of IDPs and returnees;</a></p>
<p><a id="459" name="459">(vi) publication of the voters register six months prior to elections;</a></p>
<p><a id="460" name="460">
</a></p>
<p><a id="461" name="461">and (vii) preparation by all security forces for elections-related security tasks at least six months before 
the end of the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="462" name="462">  
63. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="463" name="463">In addition, the Chair made several recommendations to the Council namely:</a></p>
<p><a id="464" name="464">(i) develop a clear 
strategy with timelines for the implementation of the critical outstanding tasks of the Agreement;</a></p>
<p><a id="465" name="465">(ii) 
reconstitute  the  various  insitiutions  and  commissions  at  the  national  level,  including  the  Anti-
Corruption Commission and the National Audit Chamber;</a></p>
<p><a id="466" name="466">(</a></p>
<p><a id="467" name="467">iii) make financial resources available for 
the completion of the Transitional Security Arrangements, and for the DDR Commission to conduct its 
work;</a></p>
<p><a id="468" name="468">(iv) fast track the establishment of the Board of the Special Reconstruction Fund and engage with 
IGAD, the AU, and the UN on the convening of the Pledging Conference;</a></p>
<p><a id="469" name="469">(v) continue to support broad-
based public consultations on the establishment of the CTRH, and in doing so, safeguard the civic space 
and  foster  an  inclusive  environment;</a></p>
<p><a id="470" name="470"> </a></p>
<p><a id="471" name="471">(vi)  prioritise  and  expedite  the  permanent  constitution  making 
process;</a></p>
<p><a id="472" name="472"> </a></p>
<p><a id="473" name="473">and  (vii)  engage  more  with  the  Region  and  the  international  community  in  mobilising  the 
political support and goodwill necessary for full implementation of the R-ARCSS.    
64.  </a></p>
<p><a id="474" name="474">RJMEC undertook a series of workshops aimed at updating members of the TNLA on the status 
of implementation and their vital role within the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="475" name="475">In that regard, RJMEC stressed the need 
for  the  members  to  take  quick  action  on  enacting  the  Constitution  </a></p>
<p><a id="476" name="476">Making  Process  Bill  and  other 
pending legislation.</a></p>
<p><a id="477" name="477">Further, members were encouraged to interact more closely with the  RTGoNU in 
order to follow progress on other legislation requiring review such as the National Elections Bill.</a></p>
<p><a id="478" name="478">The 
continued delay by the TNLA in enacting the legislation previously mentioned will negatively impact 
on the timing of elections.  
65.  </a></p>
<p><a id="479" name="479">The RJMEC leadership held discussions with Ms. Ilze Brands Kehris the UN Assistant Secretary 
General for Human Rights.</a></p>
<p><a id="480" name="480">The discussions focused largely on implementation of Chapter 5 of the R-
ARCSS related to transitional justice issues.</a></p>
<p><a id="481" name="481">RJMEC informed the ASG that work had started on the 
CTRH.</a></p>
<p><a id="482" name="482">The ASG was also informed, however that there is little or no progress on the Hybrid Court of 
South Sudan and the Compensation and Reparations Committee.  
66.  </a></p>
<p><a id="483" name="483">The RJMEC leadership briefed visiting ambassadors of the countries of South Africa, Rwanda, 
Nigeria, Chad and Algeria that make up the C-5.</a></p>
<p><a id="484" name="484">The briefing focused on the status of implementation 
and also made specific recommendations to the C5 on areas where the peace process can be assisted. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="485" name="485">67.  </a></p>
<p><a id="486" name="486">RJMEC has received reports of serious violations of the peace agreement that occurred in Unity 
State  between  February  to  April  2022.  </a></p>
<p><a id="487" name="487">This  involved  several  accounts  of  rape  and  sexual  violence, 
displacements and civilian deaths.</a></p>
<p><a id="488" name="488">RJMEC under article 7.10 of the R-ARCSS is required to inform the 

 

12 

RTGoNU of the violations and request remedial action.</a></p>
<p><a id="489" name="489">RJMEC then wrote to the RTGoNU through 
the President requesting to hold accountable those who are responsible for the violations.  
68.  </a></p>
<p><a id="490" name="490">The RJMEC Interim Chairperson has written to General Deng Santino Wol, Chief of Defence 
Forces of the SSPDF requesting that action be taken to hold the perpetrators of the violence in four 
separate  violation  reports  issued  by  CTSAMVM.  </a></p>
<p><a id="491" name="491">The  detailed  violations  report  from  CTSAMVM 
highlights many accounts of SGBV, and killings committed by the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="492" name="492">While commending General 
Deng Santino Wol for action already taken against some perpetrators, the Chairman requested that he 
consider all CTSAMVM’s recommendations on actions that need to be taken by the SSPDF leadership, 
as well as the JDB, in order to hold those responsible for the violations accountable. 
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="493" name="493">III.  </a></p>
<p><a id="494" name="494">Key Observations and Recommendations  

 

            Observations 

69.  </a></p>
<p><a id="495" name="495">The  report  notes  that  during  the  quarter  very  little  progress  was  made  in  the 
implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="496" name="496">In particular, as it relates to the key outstanding task relating 
to  the  unification  of  the  NUF,  very  little  was  accomplished.  </a></p>
<p><a id="497" name="497">The  RTGoNU  succeeded  in 
unifying  the  Command  structure  but  not  much  else  beyond  that.  </a></p>
<p><a id="498" name="498">Failure  to  complete  the 
unification continues to be a major cause of concern particularly in view of the spiralling level 
of  intercommunal  violence  in  some  parts  of  the  country.  </a></p>
<p><a id="499" name="499">There  is  an  expectation  that  the 
redeployment of the NUF into those areas impacted by intercommunal violence may help in 
reducing such incidents. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="500" name="500">70.  </a></p>
<p><a id="501" name="501">Regrettably, there is also very slow progress on implementation of elections related tasks 
such as the passage of relevant legislation and reconstitution of the two independent competent 
bodies  the  NEC  and  PPC.  </a></p>
<p><a id="502" name="502">These  bodies  have  specific  mandates,  which  are  critical  in  the 
conduct of free and fair elections.</a></p>
<p><a id="503" name="503">In the absence of the establishment of those bodies,  there 
are concerns that some of the parties have started partisan political mobilization in some  parts 
of the country. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="504" name="504">71.  </a></p>
<p><a id="505" name="505">Reports by CTSAMVM, and the human rights commission at UNMISS have expressed 
concerns over the rise in cases of sexual assault in the quarter.  </a></p>
<p><a id="506" name="506">Of great concern were the cases 
of  sexual  violence  reported  in  Koch  and  Leer  in  Unity  State.  </a></p>
<p><a id="507" name="507">The  reports  also  pointed  to 
increasing levels of violence witnessed in Upper Nile and Unity States between the SPLA-IO 
forces and former defectors claiming to belong to the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="508" name="508">It is critically important that all 
forces observe the permanent ceasefire.</a></p>
<p><a id="509" name="509">Finally, it is worrying that despite verified reports by 
CTSAMVM  and  the  UN  Human  Rights  commission,  and  RJMEC  requesting  action  from 
RTGoNU, no punitive action has so far been taken against the perpetrators of these atrocities. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="510" name="510">This lack of action it is feared may fuel further impunity. 
72.  </a></p>
<p><a id="511" name="511">The humanitarian situation in South Sudan continues to worsen in the face of cutbacks 
in the provision of humanitarian aid.</a></p>
<p><a id="512" name="512">This coupled with rising levels of intercommunal violence 
and flooding have served to greatly slow the return of refugees and IDPs to their homes.</a></p>
<p><a id="513" name="513">At the 
same time, RTGoNU has done very little to establish the Special Reconstruction Fund Board. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="514" name="514">Establishment  of the Fund  remains a matter of urgency especially  in  view of  the increasing 
needs and dwindling external funding.</a></p>
<p><a id="515" name="515"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="516" name="516">73.  </a></p>
<p><a id="517" name="517">After more than ten years, the government of South Sudan has succeeded in repaying 
the full amount of US $3.03 billion of the TFA to Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="518" name="518">However, reports that the government 
of Sudan continues to confiscate the 28 000 barrels/day of oil is cause for concern.</a></p>
<p><a id="519" name="519">There was 
an expectation that these resources could now be diverted towards implementation of the R-

 

13 

ARCSS, and enhancing RTGoNU’s ability to provide much needed resources to the unification 
of the NUF and other agreement related tasks.   
74.  </a></p>
<p><a id="520" name="520">The completion of the public consultations aimed at developing the legislation to govern 
the CTRH process, is expected to provide the platform for developing the necessary legislation. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="521" name="521">This  will  hopefully  set  the  pace  for  setting  up  the  CTRH,  which  is  the  transitional  justice 
institution  prioritised  by  the  RTGoNU.  </a></p>
<p><a id="522" name="522">Unfortunately,  the  Permanent  Constitution  Making 
Process,  which  is  also  greatly  anticipated  by  the  people  of  South  Sudan  appears  not  to  be 
progressing  with  the  legislation  still  stuck  at  the  TNLA.  </a></p>
<p><a id="523" name="523">It  is  therefore  imperative  that  the 
TNLA kick-start the process of Permanent Constitution making.  
 

   </a></p>
<p><a id="524" name="524">Recommendations 

 
75.</a></p>
<p><a id="525" name="525">In an effort to increase the pace of implementation of the R-ARCSS, the report therefore 

offers the following recommendations to the RTGoNU, TNLA, and IGAD. 
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="526" name="526">a.  To the RTGONU

<p><a id="553" name="553">IV.  </a></p>
<p><a id="554" name="554">Conclusion 

76. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="555" name="555">The failure of the RTGoNU to move forward with the graduation of the NUF continues 
to be a source of grave concern given the critical importance of accomplishing this task to the 
overall  peace  and  security  of  South  Sudan.  </a></p>
<p><a id="556" name="556">Similarly,  greater  efforts  must  be  placed  by  the 
RTGoNU  in    completing  the  roadmap  towards  the  holding  of  free  and  fair  elections.  </a></p>
<p><a id="557" name="557">This 
Roadmap should ideally prioritise activities that must be achievable and the requisite resources 
obtained  to  ensure  that  the  tasks  are  carried  out.  </a></p>
<p><a id="558" name="558">There  is  increasing  uneasiness  among  the 
population, the longer it takes to complete these two important tasks, given the proximity to the 
end  of  the  Transitional  Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="559" name="559">   </a></p>
<p><a id="560" name="560">Now  is  the  time  for  the  RTGoNU  to  recommit  to  the  full 
implementation of the R-ARCSS, commit the necessary level of resources and work tirelessly 
to take the country down the road to lasting peace and prosperity.</a></p>
<p><a id="561" name="561">  
77. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="562" name="562">On its part and pursuant to its mandate as provided for in Chapter 7 of the R-ARCSS, 
the RJMEC will continue to monitor, evaluate, report on the status of implementation of the R-
ARCSS,  as  circumstances  demand,  intervene  to  break  any  deadlock  that  may  emerge  in  the 
course of implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="563" name="563">It will regularly provide reports and briefings to the RTGoNU, the 
reconstituted TNLA, Chairperson of the IGAD Assembly of Heads of State and Government, 
Chairperson  of  the  IGAD  Council  of  Ministers,  the  Chairperson  of  the  African  Union 
Commission, the Peace and Security Council of the African Union and to the Secretary General 
of the United Nations and the Security Council of the United Nations.</a></p>
