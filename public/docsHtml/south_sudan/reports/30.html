Tea     Hostilities have been ongoing in the north of Jonglei State, particularly in Pigi County,
since Government Forces crossed the Sobat River on  November 2014 as described in V017
(Reference A).
</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">1.1     Complaints were made to IGAD by the SPLM/A-IO on  November about offensive
operations by Government Forces which were answered by JTC (Reference B), where it was
explained that without Liaison Officers from the SPLM/A-IO and also the confused situation on
the ground it was not possible for the MVM to realistically visit the areas mentioned.

<p><a id="22" name="22">:</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">    Hostilities continued in northern Jonglei, and on 28 November 2014 the JTC Chairman
wrote to the Special Envoys (Reference C) expressing concern and recommending that the
Parties be reminded of their responsibilities under the COHA and cease all hostilities
immediately, which would allow the MVT to carry out investigations.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">Since then it would appear
that there has been no improvement, as witnessed by reports gathered by the MVT, UNMISS
and other organisations and by reports in the press.

1.2     Recent reports — including claims in the media by Government Forces - suggest that
Government Forces have taken New Fangak in Fangak County.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">According to paragraph 1.3  of
Reference F it was agreed by both parties that the Sudan Peoples’ Liberation Movement/Army-
In Opposition (SPLM/A-IO) is dominant in Fangak County.
</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">1.4  Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The aim of this report is to provide IGAD Special Envoys with information about
violations in New Fangak, Fangak County and also violations of the MVTs freedom of
movement.
</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">1.5    Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">Government Forces refused the MVT access to New Fangak, and
because of this a wide variety of other sources were used to gain information about the situation
there.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">Sources included Community Liaison Officers (CLO’s), UNMISS, reports in the media
and Government Forces Liaison Officers.
</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">2.0  Violations of COHA — New Fangak and MVT freedom of Movement
2a    On 26 November 2014 the MVT based in the UNMISS Camp at Malakal received
information that there was fighting between Government Forces and the SPLM/A-IO in the area
between New Fangak and Atar.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">Reports received from Government forces claimed that the
SPLM/A-IO had attacked their positions.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">It was not possible for the MVT to either visit the area
or speak with representative of the SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The MVT continued to receive reports of
hostilities in the area for the following  days.
2.1      On  December 2014 the MVT received information that Government Forces had taken
New Fangak in Fangak County.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">This information came from a variety of sources.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">It therefore
became a priority for MVM to visit New Fangak in order to investigate an apparent violation of
the COHA.
:3)     In order to plan a visit of the MVT to New Fangak the JTC sent a formal notification to
the Director of Operations of the SPLA (Government Forces) informing him of a planned MVT
visit to New Fangak.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">However Government Forces refused to allow an MVT helicopter access
to New Fangak.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">(Reference E).
</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">2.2      Assessment
•</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">The weight of evidence suggests that Government Forces are in full occupation of
New Fangak, Fangak County.
</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">•</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">New Fangak is, according to the agreement signed on 17 November 2014
(Reference F), in a county where both Parties agreed the SPLM/A-IO are dominant.
</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">•</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">The refusal of Government Forces to allow the MVT to visit New Fangak is in
violation of those provisions of the COHA which guarantee Freedom of Movement
to the MVT.
