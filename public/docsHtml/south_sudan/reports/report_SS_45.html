BURNING OF HOMES IN THE YEI AREA
Executive Summary

</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">There were extensive reports from various sources and significant media coverage of
alleged destruction of homes in the Yei area in November and December 2016.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">The COGS SPLA instructed the JMCC to initiate a CTSAMM investigation to determine

™ ></a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">whether homes had been destroyed, the extent of the destruction and the responsibility
for any destruction.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">The request from JMCC identified  town/villages in the Yei area
which needed to be visited as part of the investigation.
</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">A patrol was conducted by a CTSAMM MVT from 30 January until  February 2017.
</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">CTSAMM was able to verify the situation in  of the  locations which were part of the
verification plan.
</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">CTSAMM finds that there has been extensive destruction of homes by burning in
Lainya, Sanzasiri, Morobo and Lutaya.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">Detailed numbers cannot be confirmed but it is
likely that in excess of 3000 homes were destroyed in Lainya alone.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">

</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">~
CTSAMM could not verify the situation in  of the locations identified by JMCC due to
Freedom of Movement (FOM) issues and time constraints.
</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">CTSAMM assesses that there is compelling evidence to support the conclusion that
Government Forces were responsible for the deliberate destruction of homes by
burning, and therefore in violation of the ARCSS.

1.0  Introduction
1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">

</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">•</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">There have been multiple accounts of homes in the Yei area being destroyed
with deliberate intent by warring parties since August 2016.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">A Human Rights
Watch report and media coverage described the activity as forced
displacement and brought the events and other allegations of abuse to the
attention of the international community in November 2016.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">Movement to Yei

~           by CTSAMM and UNMISS had been restricted until late November 2016
when a joint CTSAMM and UNMISS Long Range Patrol was conducted from
28 Nov until  Dec. The patrol findings were briefed at the " CTSAMM Board
and found that displacement of civilian settlements had occurred.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">

</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">•</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">Amongst the reports and media coverage of the situation in Yei was an
allegation that villages and huts had been burned along the Juba-Yei road by
Government Forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">In response to these allegations on 12 December the
SPLA Chief of General Staff requested JMCC to initiate an investigation.
</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">JMCC requested CTSAMM to visit, verify and ascertain the truth regarding
the allegations in the areas alleged to have been razed by the SPLA.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The
request was made by the JMCC to CTSAMM on 15 Dec 2016 .and</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">a                 ordination meetings were subsequently held with SPLA to plan a verification
patrol.

<p><a id="39" name="39">

</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">•</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">The specific allegation was that about 1900 houses were burnt by Government
Forces in Yei River State.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">A map was provided by JMCC with specific locations
in five areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">The five areas were:</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">

</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">o Yei town and villages within a -20 kilometre radius of Yei town.

<p><a id="50" name="50">The aim of this report is to outline the investigations into the burning of
homes in the Yei area with findings and recommendations.
</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">1.4  Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">

</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">•</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">The Yei MVT — which is based in Juba — deployed with UNMISS force

protection to the Yea area from 30 January to  February 2017.

~~                 •</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">The MVT metwith a wide range of local officials, military commanders, church
leaders and civil representatives.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">The team was also able to meet with and
interview ordinary citizens, many of whom were victims.

</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">•</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">Locations:</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">The MVT visited burned houses in the following locations:</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">

</a></p>

2.0  PATROL FINDINGS
2.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">The MVT saw a large number of burned buildings, including traditional tukuls as
well as brick-built houses.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">It was not possible to accurately identify the number
~          of buildings destroyed, but the destruction was extensive.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">The burned houses
were verified in the following areas:</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">

</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">•</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">Lutaya Village.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">Visited 31 Jan 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">The village was abandoned with many
destroyed homes, it was not possible to ascertain when the homes were
destroyed..

•</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">Sanzasiri Village.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">Visited 31 Jan, also abandoned, many destroyed homes
with indications that some of the homes had been burned recently.

</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">•</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">Morobo Town.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">Visited  February 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">Large numbers of burned dwellings
were observed.

</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">•</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">Lainya Town.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">Visited  February 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">A large area of the town has burned
homes, the County Executive Director confirmed that ,080 residences were
burned, allegedly as a result of a natural wildfire that occurred on or about 
January 2017.

</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">•</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">Glumbi Village.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">On route to the Morobo on  February 2017 the MVT
observed widespread evidence of burned homes in villages which have been
abandoned.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">

2.2  SPLA military commanders claimed that some of the houses were burnt “by the

~             ” or as a result of crossfire when the IO attacked Government Positions.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">This

assertion is countered by the information gathered following interviews with a

wide range of witnesses (civil society representatives, faith groups and villagers)
who state that in most cases the buildings were deliberately set on fire by

Government Forces soldiers, comprising both SPLA and allied militia.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">According

to the Ugandan military officials in charge of border crossings at Kaya 12000

civilians fled across the border in January.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">The refugees stated that amongst the
reasons for fleeing was the burning of their homes by Government Forces.

2.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">In the case of Lainya, County Officials stated that in excess of 3000 residences
were burned.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">Officials stated that the destruction was a result of a wildfire in
early January.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">However the map provided by JMCC that identified where

“               buildings were alleged to have been destroyed in the Lainya area was dated well
in advance of January.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">The MVT observed in many cases examples of dwellings
which have been destroyed but surrounding fences, bushes, paths and dry scrub
were untouched by scorching.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">There is evidence that brick built structures have
been burned from the interior rather than by the effect of wildfires burning the
exterior of structures.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">Interviews with witnesses to the destruction produced
consistent statements that the homes had been deliberately destroyed by
Government Forces comprising SPLA and allied militia.

2.4  </a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">The MVT spoke to the Uganda military official responsible for  crossing points
in the Kaya area.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">Displacement of civilians has been widespread and the log
book for the crossing point indicated that 12000 South Sudanese had crossed
into Uganda in January.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">Refugees are routinely interviewed at the crossing
points and amongst the reasons given for leaving the Yei area was the burning
of their homes by Government Forces.

2.5  </a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">The MVT was not able to visit all the areas identifies on the map provided by the
JMCC.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">The Government Forces Military Intelligence officer in Yei denied

~          UNMISS access to Acholi and without force protection it was not safe for the
MVT to proceed.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">The team did not get to Shitata because there was insufficient
time to reach the village given the poor road conditions.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">

2.6|The MVT encountered hostility from Government Forces checkpoints on several
occasions:</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">at one time the soldiers on a checkpoint pointed their weapons and
pointed them at the CTSAMM/UNMISS patrol which was forced to turn back.
</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">Many citizens were reluctant to talk to the MVT for fear of reprisals.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">As previously
stated in the Monitoring Report presented at the last CTSAMM meeting, the
people of the Yei area live in fear.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">

2.7  </a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">During the course of the MVT patrol a number of other violations were alleged to
have occurred including looting of homes and burning of churches.</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">While the

a              patrol was underway there were reports of homes being burned in the vicinity of
Asole on the same day that the patrol had been denied access.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">

</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">2.8     Many of those the MVT spoke with blamed the ‘Mathiang Anyoor’ militia for the
destruction wrought in Yei River State, and suggested there was an ethnic
dimension to the violence.

</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">3.0  Assessment

3.1  There has been extensive destruction of homes by fire in the Yei area.</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">Given the
statements by Lainya officials referring to the destruction of 3000 in Lainya alone
the total numbers of homes destroyed is likely to be well in excess of that figure.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">

3.2  </a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">There is sufficient evidence for JCTSAMM to conclude that the main reason for
the destruction of homes in Morobo, Lutaya, Sanzasiri and Lainya was deliberate
action by Government Forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">The contention that the destruction in Lainya was
a result of wild fire is not supported by the findings of CTSAMM.

</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">~

3.3  It is not possible to confirm whether homes were destroyed or by what means in
Asole or Shitata.

3.4  </a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">The effect of widespread violence in the Yei area has been to traumatize the
civilian population and to displace large numbers of people fear of Government
Forces.

3.5  </a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">There is compelling evidence that other violations are ongoing in the Yei area
and that further patrols are required in order to verify the circumstances and
veracity of the allegations made.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">

</a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">4.0  Conclusion

~

It is the opinion of JTC that Government Forces have been in clear breach of
Chapter II of the ARCSS in the Yei area:</a></p>
