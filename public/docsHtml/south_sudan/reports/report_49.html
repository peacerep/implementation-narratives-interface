<p><a id="24" name="24">Introduction

1.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">

</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">a.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">In order to fulfil its mandate CTSAMVM is required to monitor the
implementation of the R-ARCSS and where required to visit multiple locations
in South Sudan to make observations.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">This includes visits to the formations
and units of all parties to the agreement, including Cantonment Sites and
Training Centres.

</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">b. The Peace Agreements (ACOH of 21 December 2017 and R-ARCSS of 12
September 2018) provide that CTSAMVM and its MVTs have unhindered and
unconditional access to any area within the control of a Party to enable
CTSAMVM to conduct its monitoring and investigatory activity.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">

</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">c. There is no legal requirement or contractual obligation, in any peace document
signed by the Parties, which suggests that CTSAMVM must provide notification
to a Party or Parties that it will be conducting a patrol through or visiting territory
under that Party's or parties’ control.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">A summary of all pertinent articles of the
SOMA, ACOH and R-ARCSS is to be found at Annex A.

2.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The aim of this report is to describe incidents which took place on 08 February
2022 at AMADI checkpoint and to attribute responsibility for violations of the ACOH
and R-ARCSS where appropriate.

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">This report draws upon an incident report submitted to CTSAMVM
by Sector  which contains witness statements and photographic evidence.

</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">Incident

4.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">CTSAMVM received allegations of training and recruitment at Digala by SSPDF in
September 2021 and December 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">During the investigation process the
CTSAMVM were refered to Lt Gen James Koang, ACDF (Assistant Chief of
Defence Forces) SSPDF responsible for training.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">In the discussions the team were
informed by the ACDF on 28 September 2021 that there was no need for the
CTSAMVM to visit Digala however such statements amount to non-cooperation
and served to delay investigations.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">On  January 2022 CTSAMVM received further allegations of training and
recruitment at Digala.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">On 17 January 2022 CTSAMVM again met with the ACDF,
Lt Gen James Koang.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">He briefed that 400 personnel under Brigadier Moses Lokujo
SSPDF had been moved to Digala where they had been integrated into the
SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">He further stated that on 16 January 2022 144 SSPDF soldiers had been
moved from Bentiu to Digala pending redeployment elsewhere.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">He re-iterated his
view that CTSAMVM did not need to visit Digala.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">

6.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">CTSAMVM is required to physically verify reports of force movements and
allegations of training and recruitment.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">Therefore, a visit to Digala was planned to
include Force Protection from UNMISS.

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">On 08 February 2022 personnel from CTSAMVM Sector  departed on a planned
visit to Digala area to investigate the allegations of recruitment and training.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">The
CTSAMVM visiting team comprised of four International Observers and four
National Monitors.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">The CTSAMVM team was accompanied by an UNMISS Force
Protection Unit.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">At 7.50  Hrs on  February the CTSAMVM team and UNMISS detachment were
stopped at a checkpoint at Amadi.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">The checkpoint was operated by SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">A
private soldier instructed the team to stop while he summoned his superior.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Sgt
John Dud was the superior who stated that he had clear instructions from his HQ
not to allow CTSAMVM and UNMISS to proceed to Digala.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">Shortly afterwards
Major Elias Mayor arrived at the checkpoint on a motorbike.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">He stated to
CTSAMVM that “when you go to someone’s house you must knock on the door

|
and be allowed in, the SSPDF door is at Bilpham and CTSAMVM should go there
first.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">The people in Digala cannot meet the team’.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">After speaking to CTSAMVM, Major Elias Mayor spoke to the SSPDF soldiers at
the checkpoint and departed on his motorbike.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">After he had spoken to the SSPDF
soldiers, who were in uniform and civilian clothes, became more aggressive and
demanded that CTSAMVM and UNMISS turn around and return to Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">At this
point, in order to defuse the situation, CTSAMVM and UNMISS moved back 500
metres from the checkpoint and reported the situation to CTSAMVM Operations
staff.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">

</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">10.At 8.0  </a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">Hrs</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">an SSPDF ° Lieutenant (Lt) approached the CTSAMVM /UNMISS
party at their new location.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">The officer was aggressive and clearly anxious.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">He told
the team to move.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">He said that he would count up to ten and then his soldiers
would open fire on the CTSAMVM team.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">He then raised his hand and started to
count.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">The CTSAMVM, not wishing to see the situation deteriorate even further,
then left Amadi and returned to Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">The SSPDF Lt followed the team for some
distance.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">

</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">11.In an attempt to permit the visit to Digala to continue CTSAMVM held a meeting
with the SSPDF SNLO who undertook to travel to Bilpham to meet with SSPDF
senior leadership.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">No communication has been received concerning access to
Digala.

</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">Assessment

12.On 08 February 2022 at Amadi CTSAMVM personnel were subjected to acts of
hostility and intimidation by SSPDF soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">The SSPDF committed a violent
assault against the CTSAMVM officials by announcing that they would open fire
unless the CTSAMVMV party left Amadi.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">A countdown to firing was started by the
SSPDF Lt from Amadi.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">This assault directed against CTSAMVM posed a serious
risk to life and directly threatened both the physical and psychological well-being
of the members of the CTSAMVM team.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">

13.On 08 February 2022 at Amadi SSPDF soldiers purposely impeded CTSAMVM
movement and attempts to discharge its functions under the Agreements when

|
they prevented the CTSAMVM team from proceeding to Digala to investigate
serious allegations of training, recruitment and unauthorised troop movement by
SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">The action taken by SSPDF at Amadi is also a breach of the SOMA between the
Government of South Sudan and IGAD MVM, the pertinent provisions of which are
set forth in paragraph 1.0  of this Report, above.

</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">15.Major Elias Mayor is clearly either completely unaware of his and the SSPDF’s
responsibilities towards CTSAMVM and its mandate or blatantly violating the
provisions of several agreements of which he should be aware.

</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">16.The behaviour of the SSPDF Lt was unacceptable, threatening, and violent and
risked loss of life and harm to CTSAMVM officials.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">It is fortunate that CTSAMVM
personnel were able to defuse the situation before a bad situation became even
worse.

</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">Conclusions

17.CTSAMVM concludes that the SSPDF violated the following provisions of the R-
ARCSS:</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">Articles 2.0.10.0  and Article 2.0.10.0.</a></p>

ACOH:</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">Article 12.

19.CTSAMVM concludes that the SSPDF failed to cooperate with CTSAMVM in the
discharge of its (CTSAMVM’s) functions under the agreements and that the
Government/SSPDF therefore failed to comply with ACOH Articles 11.0  and 11.1.

20.CTSAMVM concludes that the violations were committed by SSPDF and
specifically Major Elias Mayor and the % Lt (name unknown) who was at Amadi.

</a></p>
