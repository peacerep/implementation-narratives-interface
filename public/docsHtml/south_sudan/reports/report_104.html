<p><a id="15" name="15">NUMBER 008
PCTSE VIOLATION IN UPPER NILE STATE
Executive Summary

</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">On  February 2016 a Car driving from Akoka to Malakal was ambushed about 14
kilometres north east of Malakal, in an unpopulated area only about 500 metres to the
east of the Nile.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">On the western bank of the Nile there are villages populated by those
affiliated to the SPLM/A-IO.

</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">At least one of the  occupants of the car was a National Security officer who was
wounded, together with the driver.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">One of the attackers was reportedly killed in an
exchange of gunfire, after which the car fled the scene and got to Malakal.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">There were
up to about 42 attackers, who were  uniformed and armed with AK47’s and PKM
machine guns.

</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">The attack took place adjacent to an area controlled by forces affiliated to the SPLM/A-

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">There are, to the knowledge of the MVT, no other armed groups in the area.  </a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">It is

therefore the assessment of the JTC that this incident does constitute a violation of the

PCTSA by the SPLM/A-IO because in the light of all the evidence the attackers were

from SPLM/A-IO forces.

<p><a id="49" name="49">The MVT also contacted commanders from the SPLM/A-IO in order to get
their version of events.
2.0  VIOLATION OF THE PCTSA

2.1       On  February 2016 a civilian car containing  people was travelling from Akoka

to Malakal (not going north from Malakal as stated in the allegation).</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">At about
47.0  Hrs it was ambushed about 14 Km north east from Malakal.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">At least one
of the occupants of the car was a National Security officer returning from leave.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">

22</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">There were -12 armed uniformed people who took part in the ambush, armed
with PKM machine guns and AK47’s.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">Some of them were in police-style rather
than military uniforms.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">A man stood up and ordered the others to open fire.
</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">Those inside the car fired back and drove through the ambush.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">It was hit several
times and the National Security officer was wounded in the leg and the driver in
the arm.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">

</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">2.0  One ofthe attackers — identified by the witness as their leader - tried to stop the
car driving off but was reportedly shot.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">The car drove on to a Government
Checkpoint and then to Malakal.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">

2.1  The MVT contacted the SPLM/A-IO through the Liaison Officer attached to the
MVT.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">The response from the SPLM/A-IO is that they had no knowledge of the
incident

</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">

3.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">The group who took part in the ambush were well armed and appeared to be well
organised.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">They were also in uniform.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">The area the ambush took place is
uninhabited, but only about 500m from the Nile, on the other side of which there
are settlements in an area under the control of forces allied to the SPLM/A-IO.

3.2  Atleast one of the passengers of the car was a government servant, specifically
an officer in National Security.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">It is impossible to say whether or not the identity
of the victims was known to the attackers, but the fact that they opened fire

straight away rather than stopping the car and stealing it undamaged indicates
that this was an organised attack rather than the work of thieves.
3.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">To the knowledge of the MVT there are no other armed groups in the area where
the attack took place.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">It is the assessment of CTSAMM that those who took part
——— es
in the ambush were beyond any reasonable doubt members of SPLM/A-IO-
affiliated forces.
</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">4.0  Conclusion
4.1  Itis the opinion of CTSAMM that the ambush north west of Malakal on  February
2016 was a violation by the SPLM/A-IO of article 1.0  of the PCTSA, specifically:</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">
</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">* Article 1.1  of the COHA:</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">“The Parties hereby agree to cease all military
actions aimed at each other and any other action that ma  undermine the
Peace Process”
•</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">Article 1.2.c of the COHA:</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">*...ensure that all forces or armed groups under
their influence, control or/and command shall observe the Agreement’.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">

5.0  Recommendations and observations:</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">

5.1  It is unlikely that this violation was the result of a deliberate act by the SPLW/A-
10.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">However, it was perpetrated by members of the SPLM/A-IO or of an affiliated
armed group and so the SPLM/A-IO remains responsible for it.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">

</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">5.2  Itis vital that the Parties exercise discipline over allied and affiliate armed groups
in order that incidents such as this do not happen.</a></p>
