Executive Summary 

This report on the status of implementation of the Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution 
of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) has been prepared pursuant to article 
7.9 of  the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">The report covers the period from 1 January to 31 March 2022 and builds 
on the previous quarterly Report No. 013/21.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">It is to be noted that with just over two years since 
the formation of the Revitalised Transitional Government of National Unity (RTGoNU), progress 
made towards implementation of the R-ARCSS, remains relatively slow.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">During the first quarter 
of 2022 the most notable progress was made with the swearing in of the state assemblies, which 
completed the formation of the government structures at the national and state levels.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">Incremental 
progress was realised in the Transitional Security Arrangements (TSA), drawing attention to the 
management of the country’s resources, and launching of the process for truth, reconciliation and 
healing.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">However, key critical outstanding bills have not yet been enacted by the Transitional National 
Legislature (TNL), public finance management reforms are slow, transitional justice mechanisms 
are yet to become fully operational and the Permanent Constitution making process has not started, 
beyond the preparation  of legislation to  guide the process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">During  the period under  review the 
RJMEC Leadership made every effort to highlight the impediments to implementation of the R-
ARCSS, and continuously appealed to the RTGoNU to take firm action given their responsibility 
for implementation of the R-ARCSS.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The  Permanent  Ceasefire  largely  continued  to  hold  among  the  signatory  parties  to  the 
Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">However, there has been a recent deterioration in the overall security situation across 
several parts of the Country, in particular Upper Nile and Unity States, and the Equatorias, In late 
March  as  renewed  focus  was  placed  on  resolving  the  Transitional  Security  Arrangements,  the 
RJMEC  Leadership  met  separately  with  H.E  Salvar  Kiir  Mayardit,  and  H.E  Dr.  Riek  Machar, 
Chairperson of the SPLM/A-IO, and encouraged the two to dialogue directly in an effort to find a 
solution  to  the  impasse  surrounding  the  unification  of  forces  and  their  graduation  and 
redeployment.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">The RJMEC leadership also highlighted the crucial importance of completing the TSAs and 
their  expected  impact  on  the  overall  peace  process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">The  Intergovernmental  Authority  on 
Development (IGAD) Chairperson ultimately  reengaged the Parties that resulted in an Agreement 
on the Unified Command structure and force ratios between the ITGoNU and the Opposition i.e, 
Sudan  Peoples’  Liberation  Movement/Army  -  In  Opposition  (SPLM/A-IO)  and  South  Sudan 
Opposition Alliance (SSOA). 

The humanitarian situation in South Sudan continued to deteriorate due to multiple shocks 
including ongoing conflict, widespread flooding, deepening food insecurity, inflation,  and lack 
of access to basic services.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">The Transitional National Legislative Assembly (TNLA) directed that 
the Future Generations Fund and the Oil Revenue Stabilization Account be operationalised in the 
2021/22 budget and the 3 percent contribution to oil producing states be reinstated and all arrears 
paid.  </a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">They  also  recommended  the  full  integration  of  the  Customs  Authority  and  the  National 
Revenue Authority (NRA).  

</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">During this quarter, it was expected that the Ministry of Justice together with the Technical 
Committee  of  the  Commission  for  Truth  Reconciliation  and  Healing(CTRH)  would  have 
commenced public consultations.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">However due to financial and logistical obstacles this process 
experienced delays, but is now expected to start later in April.  

 

</a></p>

<p><a id="132" name="132">During the period of reporting, the Permanent Ceasefire largely continued to hold among 
the signatory parties to the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">However, there has been a recent  deterioration in the 
overall security situation across several parts of the Country, in particular Upper Nile and Unity 
States,  and  the  Equatorias,  which  has  the  potential  to  derail  the  peace  process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">Of  particular 
concern  has  been  reports  from  the  Ceasefire  Transitional  Security  Arrangements  Monitoring 
and  Verification  Mechanism  (CTSAMVM)  of  18  separate  incidents/clashes  involving  party 
signatories’ armed forces and/or affiliates in Upper Nile and Unity States between 6 February 
and  25  March  2022.  </a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">Several  of  these  incidents  involved  violent  clashes  between  the  Sudan 
Peoples’ Liberation Movement/Army – In Opposition (SPLM/A-IO) and defected SPLM/A-IO 
officers  and  their  forces  claiming  to  belong  to  the  South  Sudan  People’s  Defence  Forces 
(SSPDF).

County, Upper Nile State, including in or close to Cantonment Sites and Unified Forces training

<p><a id="139" name="139">These incidents have led to both military and civilian casualties, although the exact 
numbers are unknown at this stage.</a></p>
<p><a id="140" name="140">Furthermore, they have caused considerable displacement 
of civilians, including civil leaders, resulting in increased fear and insecurity amongst the local 
communities.  </a></p>
<p><a id="141" name="141">As  of  this  Report,  accounts  continue  to  emerge  of  ongoing  fighting  between 
SPLM/A-IO  and  SSPDF/affiliated  forces  in  both  Maiwut  and  Longechuk  counties  and  the 
situation in Upper Nile State remains volatile and tense.

<p><a id="143" name="143">He  stated  the  continued  and  sustained  attacks  by  SSPDF

<p><a id="152" name="152">No  doubt, 
intercommunal  violence  remains  a  serious  threat  to  peace  across  the  Country  and  adversely 
affects the implementation of the Agreement.</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="154" name="154">It must be noted that the SSPDF and the SPLA-IO continue to occupy civilian centres, 
which is in direct contravention to article 2.2.3.1 of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="155" name="155">According to CTSAMVM 
the SSPDF is occupying 6 civilian facilities in Yei County, 2 in Torit, one in Yambio and one 
in  Malakal,  while  the  SPLA-IO  is  occupying  4  civilian  facilities  in  Yambio.  </a></p>

CTSAMVM.  </a></p>
<p><a id="159" name="159">What  is  encouraging  is  that  the  uniformed  forces  are  arresting  and  taking  the 
perpetrators  to  military  courts.  </a></p>
<p><a id="160" name="160">For  example,  CTSAMVM  during  the  reporting  period, 
investigated five alleged rape cases, one by a NAS soldier, and four by members of the SSPDF, 
which reportedly occurred between July and December 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="161" name="161">Out of the four cases allegedly 
committed by members of the SSPDF, there was one conviction, two arrests, and one case is 
still under investigation.</a></p>
<p><a id="162" name="162">As for the NAS soldier, CTSAMVM issued its report which attributed 
responsibility to NAS.</a></p>
<p><a id="163" name="163">Upon receipt of the report, RJMEC sent an official correspondence to 
General Thomas Cirillo of  NAS requesting accountability for the case, but  to date the NAS 
leadership has not yet responded.</a></p>

<p><a id="165" name="165">Also during the period of reporting CTSAMVM documented the rapes of a 60 year old

<p><a id="200" name="200">The  humanitarian  situation  in  South  Sudan  continued  to  deteriorate  due  to  multiple

and lack of access to basic services.</a></p>
<p><a id="201" name="201">It is estimated that 8.9 million people will need humanitarian 
assistance in 2022, compared to 8.3 million in 2021.</a></p>

of  disease  outbreaks,  and  widespread  displacement.  </a></p>
<p><a id="203" name="203">These  humanitarian  needs  are  likely  to

Box 1:</a></p>
<p><a id="283" name="283">Implementation of Chapter 4 After Two Years of the Transitional Period 

The Resource Economic and Financial Management chapter in the agreement addresses the management of 
South  Sudan’s  financial  and  natural  resources.  </a></p>
<p><a id="284" name="284">Mismanagement  of  these  resources  have  in  the  past  led  to 
poverty and underdevelopment, which drives conflict and in turn weakens the economic situation of the country 
leading to further poverty.  </a></p>
<p><a id="285" name="285">Implementation of this chapter is therefore intended to move the country from that 
vicious circle to a path of inclusive growth and sustainable development through accountable and transparent 
management of the country’s resources.</a></p>
<p><a id="286" name="286">
 
As of the end of the second year of the Transition Period, 13% of the provisions have been implemented whilst 
47% are in progress.  </a></p>
<p><a id="287" name="287">Of this 47% in progress, one third of them have been stalled  for over twelve months. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="288" name="288">Some progress has been registered in the management of petroleum resources, Enterprise Development Funds 
for  the  vulnerable,  operationalisation  of  the  Social  Security  Fund,  review  of  the  Strategic  Economic 
Development Roadmap and in the management of agriculture and food security.</a></p>
<p><a id="289" name="289">The Public Financial reform 
process  has  been  slow,  so  too  have  the  legislative  reforms.  </a></p>
<p><a id="290" name="290">The  assessment  reveals  that  40%  are  yet  to  be 
addressed  and  these  are  in  the  areas  of  institutions  to  be  created  notably  the  Economic  and  Financial 
Management  Authority  (EFMA),  the  reforms  in  the  oversight  institutions,  review  of  regulations  and 
management of forest, wildlife, tourism, and water resources. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="291" name="291">Concerning the management of the all-important petroleum resource, the Ministry of Petroleum has made some 
progress in implementing reforms in that sector.</a></p>
<p><a id="292" name="292">The Ministry reports that petroleum revenue accounts other 
than those of the Bank of South Sudan (BOSS) have been closed and proceeds from the sale of oil can be traced 
to Government accounts in New York and then to BOSS (Article 4.8.1.2).</a></p>
<p><a id="293" name="293">However, this is yet to be clarified 
by the Bank of South Sudan and the Ministry of Finance and Planning.</a></p>
<p><a id="294" name="294">The Ministry  has since  produced a 
petroleum marketing report for the PFM Oversight Committee as requested.</a></p>
<p><a id="295" name="295">In addition, loans and advances 
collateralised by oil have been identified (article 4.8.1.3 of the R-ARCSS) and outstanding loans were factored 
in the draft 2021/22 FY budget.</a></p>
<p><a id="296" name="296">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="297" name="297">Meanwhile, a review of employment in the oil sector has been done and a unified employment policy developed 
that regulates the employer, employee relationship and provides employment guidelines and procedures.</a></p>
<p><a id="298" name="298">One 
of the objectives of this new policy is to eliminate the large salary disparities between what the international 
oil companies participating in the joint ventures pay their international staff compared to South Sudanese staff.</a></p>
<p><a id="299" name="299">
 
The  Ministry  of  Petroleum  is  in  the  process  of  conducting  an  environmental  audit  to  assess  the  impact  of 
breaches of environmental safeguards on pollution, health risks, and destruction of ecosystems.</a></p>
<p><a id="300" name="300">Those owning 
licenses would be asked to pay compensation based on the findings.</a></p>
<p><a id="301" name="301">Cost recovery or  a financial audit was 
conducted for the period 2011 to 2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="302" name="302">The findings revealed that companies operating in the sector need to 
reimburse the GRSS considerable amounts due to non-recovery costs.

<p><a id="306" name="306">During this quarter, it was

</a></p>
<p><a id="309" name="309">In this same quarter H.E. Salva Kiir  Mayardit, President of the Republic of South Sudan 
on a number of occasions restated his commitment to the establishment of the CTRH, including 
in  his  New  Year’s  message,  where  he  reaffirmed  his  commitment  to  the  implementation  of 
Chapter 5 of the R-ARCSS.11 Furthermore, in  a press statement released on 28 March 2022, 
President Kiir recalled his New Year message and once more restated his commitment to the 
establishment of this commission noting that the CTRH would have as its objective “to receive 
complaints and eyewitness reports of victims of the tragic events of both 2013 and 2016.” 
44.  </a></p>
<p><a id="310" name="310">The President further indicated his preference for a CTRH process as compared  to the 
pursuit  of  punitive  justice  through  the  Hybrid  Court  of  South  Sudan  (HCSS).  </a></p>

argues that the HCSS has the potential of undermining reconciliation.</a></p>
<p><a id="312" name="312">These sentiments by the 
President are not necessarily shared by signatories to the Agreement, a fact he acknowledged in 
the press statement on the CTRH released on 28 March 2022.

<p><a id="316" name="316">The  RJMEC  Interim  Chairperson  urged  the  AUC 
Chairperson  to  contact  the  RTGoNU  with  a  view  of  encouraging  them  to  implement  the

<p><a id="317" name="317">The  AUC  Chairperson  on  the  urging  of  the

up on the implementation of the R-ARCSS.

<p><a id="320" name="320">With regard to  the permanent  Constitution making process under Chapter 6, there has 
been no progress  to  report during this  quarter.</a></p>
<p><a id="321" name="321">The Constitutional  Making Process  Bill  is still 
pending tabling and consideration by the reconstituted TNLA.</a></p>
<p><a id="322" name="322">However, even as the timeline for 
the implementation of the Revitalised Agreement is fast running out, considerable efforts have 
been made by RJMEC to emphasise the centrality of the permanent Constitution making process 
to the conduct of elections at the end of the Transitional Period under the Agreement, as well as 
for the sustainability of peace in South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="323" name="323">This message was communicated clearly to the

issued several resolutions13 aimed at increasing the chances of successfully implementing the 
tasks outlined in the R-ARCSS.14 An important aspect in the build-up to the Plenary meetings 
continue to be the thorough engagement with the various stakeholders and adherents to the R-
ARCSS, the diplomatic community including the regional and international guarantors of the

<p><a id="334" name="334">This  is  particularly  important 
given that the RTGoNU is tasked with implementing the transitional tasks of the R-ARCSS. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="335" name="335">Significant  emphasis  during  the  discussions  was  placed  on  activities  within  the  R-ARCSS 
where  RJMEC  believed  the  RTGoNU  needed  to  take  remedial  action  such  as  in  hastening 
Public Finance Management reforms, proactively assisting returning refugees, and establishing 
the board of the Special Reconstruction Fund to increase funding for the Agreement.   
49.  </a></p>
<p><a id="336" name="336">During the last week of March as renewed focus was placed on resolving the Transitional 
Security Arrangements, the RJMEC Leadership met separately with H.E Salvar Kiir Mayardit, 
and H.E Dr. Riek Machar, Chairperson of the SPLM/A-IO, and encouraged the two to dialogue 
directly in an effort to find a solution to the impasse surrounding the unification of forces and 
their  graduation  and  redeployment.  </a></p>
<p><a id="337" name="337">The  RJMEC  leadership  also  highlighted  the  crucial 
importance of completing the TSAs and their expected impact on the overall peace process.

Observations 

54.  </a></p>
<p><a id="384" name="384">The report notes that overall, progress in the implementation of some key provisions of 
the  R-ARCSS  during  the  quarter  was  slow.  </a></p>
<p><a id="385" name="385">This  is  particularly  concerning  given  that  22 
February 2022 marked the two year anniversary of the RTGoNU, with less than eleven months 
left  to  complete  the  three  year  Transitional  Period  of  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="386" name="386">Among  the  major 
achievements during the two year period have been the formation of government structures at 
the  state  and  local  government  levels  and  general  holding  of  the  ceasefire  among  signatory 
parties.  </a></p>
<p><a id="387" name="387">However,  a  number  of  critical  tasks  remain  undone  including  the  permanent 
Constitution for South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="388" name="388">Box 2 below details a listing of both the major achievements and 
the tasks that are yet to be completed.</a></p>

Box 2:</a></p>
<p><a id="391" name="391">Major Achievements and Critical Pending Tasks of the R-ARCSS 

1.  </a></p>
<p><a id="392" name="392">Since  its  signing,  the  Revitalised  Peace  Agreement  has  contributed  significantly  to  the 

following:</a></p>
<p><a id="393" name="393">
a)  cessation of violence across the country amongst the signatories to the Agreement and continued 

holding of the permanent ceasefire;</a></p>
<p><a id="394" name="394">

b)  the  establishment  and  reconstitution  of  all  Pre-Transitional  institutions  and  implementation 

mechanisms of the Agreement;</a></p>
<p><a id="395" name="395">

c)  establishment  of  the  Revitalised  Transitional  Government  of  National  Unity  and  state  level 

government;</a></p>
<p><a id="396" name="396">

d)  reconstitution of the Transitional National Legislature and the state assemblies;</a></p>
<p><a id="397" name="397">
e) 

incorporation  of  the  Revitalised  Peace  Agreement  into  the  Transitional  Constitution  of  the 
Republic of South Sudan (TCRSS, 2011), as amended;</a></p>
<p><a id="398" name="398">

f)  the  review  and  amendments  of  all  security  related  laws  by  the  National  Constitutional 
Amendment  Committee  (NCAC),  which  have  been  submitted  to  the  Revitalised  Unity 
Government, awaiting enactment;</a></p>
<p><a id="399" name="399">

g)  cantonment and screening, selection and training of Phase 1 of the Necessary Unified Forces, 

with approximately 50,000 trainees awaiting graduation and redeployment;</a></p>
<p><a id="400" name="400">

h)  opening  of  humanitarian  corridors  which  has  facilitated  gradual  voluntary  return  of  some 

refugees and IDPs;</a></p>
<p><a id="401" name="401">

i)  stabilisation of the exchange rate and progress in implementing some economic reforms by the 

Revitalised Unity Government;</a></p>
<p><a id="402" name="402">and 

j)  development of a roadmap for implementing the requirements of Transitional Justice and the 

making of the Permanent Constitution. 

 
</a></p>
<p><a id="403" name="403">2.  </a></p>
<p><a id="404" name="404">The above progress notwithstanding, some critical tasks of the Agreement remain pending.</a></p>
<p><a id="405" name="405">

Most notably, they include the following:</a></p>
<p><a id="406" name="406">  
a)  establishment of the ad hoc Judicial Reform Committee mandated to study and    recommend   

appropriate judicial reforms to the Revitalised Unity Government;</a></p>
<p><a id="407" name="407"> 

b)   ratification of eight bills by the Transitional National Legislature (TNL), namely   six security 

bills, the Constitution Making Bill, and the Political Parties Bill;</a></p>
<p><a id="408" name="408">

c)  reconstitution of the Political Parties Council, and amendment of the National    Elections Act, 

2012, and reconstitution of a competent and impartial National Elections Commission;</a></p>
<p><a id="409" name="409">

d)  the  unification  of  forces  and 

their  redeployment,  and 

implementing  Disarmament, 

Demobilisation, and Reintegration programmes;</a></p>
<p><a id="410" name="410">

e)  addressing  the  challenges  of  reconstruction,  repatriation,  resettlement,  rehabilitation  and 

reintegration of IDPs and returnees;</a></p>
<p><a id="411" name="411"> 

f)  establishment of the Special Reconstruction Fund (SRF) and Board and the convening of a South 

Sudan Pledging Conference to support its humanitarian and reconstruction efforts;</a></p>
<p><a id="412" name="412">

g)  reforming the Public Financial Management institutions, especially the National Audit Chamber 

and the Anti-Corruption Commission to enhance transparency and accountability;</a></p>
<p><a id="413" name="413">

h)  establishment of the three Transitional Justice mechanisms, namely the Commission for Truth, 
Reconciliation  and  Healing,  the  Hybrid  Court  for  South  Sudan,  and  the  Compensation  and 
Reparation Authority;</a></p>
<p><a id="414" name="414">and 

i)  completion of the permanent constitution making process to guide the conduct of elections.</a></p>
<p><a id="415" name="415">

55.  </a></p>
<p><a id="416" name="416">The increasing levels of violence witnessed in Upper Nile and Unity States between the 
SPLA-IO forces and former defectors claiming to belong to the SSPDF must be addressed as 
a matter of urgency.</a></p>
<p><a id="417" name="417">It is critically important that all forces observe the permanent ceasefire  
 

 

13 

and refrain from committing hostile acts, which seriously undermines the R-ARCSS and results 
in  civilian casualties and displacements.</a></p>
<p><a id="418" name="418">With regards to the ffighting  between the SSPDF and 
NAS,  this  can  only  stop  if  both  Parties  recommit  to  the  Cessation  of  Hostilities  Agreement 
(CoHA) signed in Addis Ababa in December 2017, as they have pledged to do.</a></p>
<p><a id="419" name="419">In addition, it 
is important to initiate the next round of the Rome talks, under the auspices of the Sant’Egidio 
Community, which should help in addressing the situation. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="420" name="420">56.  </a></p>
<p><a id="421" name="421">As in the past, the continual intercommunal violence in several states combined with the 
dire humanitarian situation is one of considerable concern.</a></p>
<p><a id="422" name="422">The appointment by H.E Salva Kiir 
Mayardit,  therefore,  of  a  high  level  committee  headed  by  H.E.  Vice  President  Hussein 
Abdelbagi,  to  investigate  the  violence  between  communities  in  Twic  County  and  the  Ngok 
Dinka is welcomed.</a></p>
<p><a id="423" name="423">Such efforts by the RTGoNU must be stepped up and sustained in an effort 
to drastically reduce the cycle of violence and foster sustainable peace.</a></p>
<p><a id="424" name="424">Indeed, the incredible 
high  human  cost  and  suffering,  which  has  compounded  the  humanitarian  situation  with 
increasing  displacements  of  the  civilian  population  must  be  addressed  with  the  greatest 
urgency.</a></p>
<p><a id="425" name="425">In that regard, the JDB should continue to act proactively to diffuse potential hotspots 
of violence and keep rival forces separated.18   
57.  </a></p>
<p><a id="426" name="426">Public Financial Management reforms are key to  improving the level of transparency 
and accountability in the management of the country’s natural resources.</a></p>
<p><a id="427" name="427">Those efforts should 
be strengthened through the restructuring and reconstituting of institutions such as the Anti-
corruption Commission and the National Audit Chamber.</a></p>
<p><a id="428" name="428">Directives issued by the TNLA to  
operationalise  the  Future  Generations  Fund  and  the  Oil  Revenue  Stabilization  Account  are 
good steps in the right direction.</a></p>
<p><a id="429" name="429">Also, ensuring that transfers to the oil producing counties and 
states are completed, can only help to improve confidence in the management of the country’s 
resources.   
58.  </a></p>
<p><a id="430" name="430">The  recent  launch  of  the  public  consultations  aimed  at  developing  the  legislation  to 
govern the CTRH process, is a step in the right direction.</a></p>
<p><a id="431" name="431">It’s important that the people of South 
Sudan  feel  that  they  are  part  of  that  process  and  that  their  voices  are  heard.  </a></p>
<p><a id="432" name="432">Similarly,  the 
Permanent  Constitution  Making  Process  should  embrace  the  varied  inputs  of  the  people  by 
encouraging widespread public dialogue and participation.</a></p>
<p><a id="433" name="433">It is therefore imperative that the 
TNLA kick-start the process of permanent Constitution making.</a></p>

Conclusion 

60.  </a></p>
<p><a id="469" name="469">With just a little over eleven months to go to the end of the Transitional Period it is not 
surprising that increasing attention is being paid to the question of the holding of elections.</a></p>
<p><a id="470" name="470">It is 
critically important that any such elections are seen to be free, fair and credible.</a></p>
<p><a id="471" name="471">To get to this 
stage the Parties to the Agreement must carefully consider the outstanding activities and agree 
on a Roadmap that can be successfully negotiated to the end of the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="472" name="472">This 
Roadmap should ideally prioritise activities that must be achievable and the requisite resources 
obtained to ensure that the tasks are carried out.   
61. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="473" name="473">On the heels of the progress made by the Parties in agreeing on the way towards the 
completion  of  the  TSAs  this  same  spirit  of  collaboration  must  continue  to  hold.  </a></p>
<p><a id="474" name="474">Indeed,  the 
people of South Sudan long weary of conflict and yearning for sustainable peace continue to 
look towards reaping any such dividends.</a></p>
<p><a id="475" name="475">Now is the time for the RTGoNU to recommit to the 
full  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS,  commit  the  necessary  level  of  resources  and  work 
tirelessly to take the country down the road to lasting peace and prosperity. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="476" name="476">62. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="477" name="477">On its part and pursuant to its mandate as provided for in Chapter 7 of the R-ARCSS, 
the RJMEC will continue to monitor, evaluate, report on the status of implementation of the R-
ARCSS,  as  circumstances  demand,  intervene  to  break  any  deadlock  that  may  emerge  in  the 
course of implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="478" name="478">It will regularly provide reports and briefings to the RTGoNU, the 
reconstituted TNLA, Chairperson of the IGAD Assembly of Heads of State and Government, 
Chairperson  of  the  IGAD  Council  of  Ministers,  the  Chairperson  of  the  African  Union 
Commission, the Peace and Security Council of the African Union and to the Secretary General 
of the United Nations and the Security Council of the United Nations.</a></p>
