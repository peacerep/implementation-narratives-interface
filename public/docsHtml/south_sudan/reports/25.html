EQUATORIA STATE

Honourable members of CTSAMM,
Please find attached a CTSAMM JTC report on alleged violations of the Permanent
Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements (Chapter II of the Agreement on the
Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan of 26 August 2015) in
Wonduruba, Central Equatoria State

CTSAMM REPORT NUMBER 050
VIOLATIONS IN WONDURUBA
Executive Summary
CTSAMM undertook a routine patrol to Wonduruba in Central Equatoria State from 24
to 26 July 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">This was the first visit by CTSAMM to the town, and the first by UN
personnel since 2014.
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">The MVT found the town to be almost empty of civilians, and all civil buildings — and
most civilian houses — to be occupied by SPLA-IG personnel.</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">Local people told the MVT
they had been forcibly evicted, and those civilians who have not moved to Juba or fled
to Uganda now live in the bush.
</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">There is no SPLM-A-IO (RM) presence in the area, but despite this the local civilian
population is treated with suspicion and live in fear of the SPLA-IG.</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">Information from
multiple sources indicate that civilians were killed by SPLA-IG in 2015 and 2016 for
allegedly supporting SPLA-IO (RM).
</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">The local SPLA-IG commander had little knowledge of the peace process and
demonstrated complete ignorance of his duty under the PCTSA to protect civilians.
</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">CTSAMM finds SPLA-IG to be in violation of those articles of the COHA and PCTSA
that oblige the Parties to ensure that all units under their control comply with the
agreements, and all articles pertaining to the protection of civilians.

VIOLATIONS IN WONDURUBA
1.0  Introduction
1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">Wonduruba in Central Equatoria State has not seen any fighting.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">However,
the town is heavily militarised and there have long been stories of the
suffering of the civilians in the area.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">There have been no previous visits by
CTSAMM and the UN has not visited since 2014 when they found people
living in fear of occupying SPLA-IG forces.

</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">•</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">The CTSAMM visit to Wonduruba was not as a result of any specific
allegations, but a routine joint patrol to an area not previously visited in order
to assess and monitor the implementation of the PCTSA in accordance with
its mandate.

1.2.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">Aim</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">:</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">The purpose of this report is to provide an assessment of the situation in

Wonduruba, and to attribute responsibility for any violations of the PCTSA.

1.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">The MVT based in Juba undertook a patrol to Wonduruba from 24 to 26 July
2017.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">During the time the MVT spent in Wonduruba, they were able to meet with
local traditional and religious leaders, as well as civil and military authorities.
</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">The team were also able to meet a large number of local civilians, many of
whom came into the town specially to meet with the MVT and accompanying
UNMISS personnel.

CTSAMM CONFIDENTIAL

2.0  Findings

2.1| Wonduruba is heavily militarised.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The town of Wonduruba, and the three other
towns in the area are completely occupied by SPLA-IG personnel.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">Civil buildings
such as schools are used as barracks and most civilian homes have been looted
and many occupied.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">There are only a few mainly elderly people living in the
town, the inhabitants have moved into the surrounding area or gone to Juba or
indeed neighbouring countries.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">Multiple sources told the MVT that the civil
population had been forcibly displaced from the towns.

2.2  Opposition Forces passed through Wonduruba in December 2013, and it was
occupied by SPLA-IG several months later in 2014.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">There are no SPLA-IO active
in the area, but the civil population has been accused of supporting the SPLA-lO
and suffered accordingly.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">Young men in particular have been treated with
suspicion.

2.3  Multiple sources told the MVT that civilians have been killed by SPLA-IG in
Wonduruba and the surrounding area.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">52 civilians were allegedly killed in
September 2015 (apparently because they were suspected of being sympathetic
to the SPLA-IO), and despite representations by local traditional leaders to the
County Commissioner these alleged killings were never investigated.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The MVT
was also told there were further alleged killings of 23 people (reportedly tied up
and shot) in August 2016 following the events in Juba which took place in July.
</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">The MVT saw clearly that the civilian population live in fear of SPLA-IG forces.

2.4  Many citizens reported they suffer significant harassment from the SPLA-IG,
specifically denial of freedom of movement and the looting of cassava crops and
other foodstuffs

2.5  The SPLA-IG commander in Wonduruba did not know the provisions of the
PCTSA, especially those concerning his duty to protect the civilian population.

CTSAMM CONFIDENTIAL

He demonstrated little understanding of the peace process and ignorance of the

role of UNMISS or CTSAMM.

3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">

3.1| SPLA-IG forces in Wonduruba are not compliant with the PCTSA.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">Indeed their
treatment of the civilian population — their own citizens who they have a duty to
protect — is in clear violation of the PCTSA.

3.2  The Parties are obliged under the COHA and PCTSA to ensure that all forces
under their control observe the agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">The forces in Wonduruba are from a
regular SPLA-IG unit and subject to SPLA-IG discipline and command, but
despite this they are ignorant of all the agreements they should be compliant
with.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">The Government has clearly failed to ensure that after all this time the
forces in Wonduruba have been told about and understand the meaning of the
COHA and PCTSA even in the most simple terms.

4.0  Conclusion:</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">

4.1  It is the opinion of CTSAMM that SPLA-IG forces in Wonduruba are in clear
violation of Article 1.0  of the PCTSA (prohibited actions outlined in the PCTSA),
specifically:</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">Article 1c of the COHA (Cessation of Hostilities): “...ensure that all forces or
armed groups under their influence, control or/and command shall observe
this agreement”

•</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">Article 1.1  of the PCTSA:</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">“The warring parties shall disseminate the
provisions of this Agreement to all forces under their command or influence,

CTSAMM CONFIDENTIAL
and allies, to ensure compliance immediately upon signing.”
•</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">Article  of the COHA (Protection of Civilians) and 1.2.5  of the PCTSA “Acts
of hostility, intimidation, violence of attacks against the civilian population...”

5.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">

5.1  There has been no fighting in Wonduruba.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">There are no active SPLA-IO
elements in the immediate area of Wonduruba, but despite this the town is
militarised and the population lives in fear of SPLA-IG soldiers who treat them
(South Sudanese Citizens) with hostility and contempt.

5.2  The alleged killing of a large number of civilians in September 2015 and August
2016 should be investigated, and if the allegations proved true the perpetrators
should be held to account.

5.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">The COHA was signed three and a half years ago, and the ARCSS two years
ago.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">It is unacceptable that officers serving in regular units of the SPLA-IG
remain ignorant of the provisions of these agreements, and in this instance
especially those provisions concerning the protection of civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">CTSAMM
recommends that the SPLA-IG not only ensures that at least the basic provisions
of the PCTSA are promulgated, but also officers receive the appropriate
guidance and training in order that these provisions are followed.
