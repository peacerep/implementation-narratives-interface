Executive Summary 

</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">This Report on the status of implementation of the activities of the Revitalised Agreement on 
the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) is prepared pursuant 
to  Chapter VII, Article 7.9 of the R-ARCSS and covers the period 1st January to  31st March 
2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">The Report highlights the events leading up to the end of the Pre-Transitional Period and 
commencement of the Transitional Period, including the Parties’ resolution of the number of 
states  and  their  boundaries.  </a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">It  also  focuses  on  the  formation  of  the  Revitalised  Transitional 
Government of National Unity (RTGoNU) on 22nd February 2020.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">On  12th  March  2020,  President  Salva  Kiir  Mayardit  appointed  thirty-five  members  of  the 
Council of Ministers and ten deputy ministers.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">The Parties, however, failed to adhere to the 35 
percent women participation in the Executive as only nine women (26%) were appointed to the 
Council of Ministers and only one woman (10%) among the deputy ministers.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">Given the non-
adherence to the letter and spirit of the R-ARCSS, the RJMEC Interim Chairperson reminded 
the  Parties  of  their  obligation  under  the  Agreement  and  urged  that  the  issue  be  rectified. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Meanwhile,  nominations  to  the  country’s  Transitional  National  Legislature  (TNL)  and  to 
positions at the State and local government levels remain unfilled, thus delaying the completion 
of the RTGoNU’s structure and composition.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">In March the Parties to the R-ARCSS held inter-party consultations in attempts to agree on the 
responsibility sharing at the State and local government levels.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">Unfortunately, the Parties were 
unable to agree on the allocations of the ten States and the three Administrative Areas of Abyei, 
Greater Pibor and Ruweng.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">Following the Parties’ failure to agree, Dr Riek Machar Teny, First 
Vice President and Chairperson of SPLM/A-IO, sought the intervention of the RJMEC Interim 
Chairperson  to  assist  the  Parties  to  break  the  deadlock.  </a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">The  RJMEC  Interim  Chairperson 
convened a consultative meeting of the representatives of the Parties to the R-ARCSS on 27th 
March 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">The consultative meeting ended, however, without a breakthrough.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">The delay in the resolution of responsibility sharing at the State and  local government levels 
has severely constrained the formation of the TNL and threatens to halt the pace of progress in 
the  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">The  Parties  should  therefore  act  quickly  to  make  the 
necessary concessions, address the impediment and expedite the reconstitution of the remaining 
structures of the RTGoNU. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">The  Constitutional  Amendment  Bill  (No.6)  2020  was  assented  to  by  the  President  on  19th 
February 2020, after ratification by the Transitional National Legislative Assembly (TNLA). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">The NCAC  has, however, detected alterations in  the Constitutional  Amendment Act  (No. 6) 
2020,  which  were  made  after  it  was  submitted  to  the  Minister  of  Justice  and  Constitutional 
Affairs of the ITGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">Also of concern are political appointments that were made for various 
offices, including the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Petroleum;</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">six (6) Ambassadors;</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">and 
the Governor and two (2) Deputy Governors of the Bank of South Sudan, which are inconsistent 
with the provisions of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">The ITGoNU contends that the appointments made prior 
to  the formation  of the  RTGoNU were within the powers of the President  to  do so.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">RJMEC 

 

  
 iii 

agrees  with  these  powers  for  the  appointment  of  the  Governor  of  Bank  of  South  Sudan  but 
expects a fresh appointment in conformity with the R-ARCSS Article 4.2.3. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">The  Permanent  Ceasefire  between  the  signatories  of  the  R-ARCSS  has  continued  to  hold, 
signalling the Parties’ continuing commitment to the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">However, there were reports 
of violent inter-communal clashes, cattle raids and revenge attacks, typically among youth, in 
the areas of Greater Bahr el Ghazal, Lakes, Unity, Jonglei, Greater Upper Nile and Abyei, which 
have resulted in scores of death, injuries and destruction of property.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">The violence is partly 
attributed  to  the  existing  security  vacuum  arising  from  the  delay  in  the  restructuring  and 
reconstitution of State authorities including the appointment of governors.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">Screening, selection training and redeployment of the Necessary Unified Forces (NUF) was one 
of  the  outstanding  tasks  of  the  Pre-Transitional  Period,  which  were  carried  forward  into  the 
Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">At least 78,500 personnel have been registered at the various cantonment 
sites, barracks and training centres.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">To date, in excess of 45,000 organized forces from both the 
Government and the Opposition forces have reportedly moved from cantonment sites to training 
centres in preparation for unification training and subsequent redeployment.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">A total of 7.5 million people in South Sudan are in need of humanitarian assistance.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">Six million 
people were expected to  be  acutely food insecure in  the period February  – April 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">This 
perilous food security and livelihood situation has worsened from the COVID-19 pandemic in 
the wake of lockdown measures set by the high-level task force on COVID-19 including the 
closure of businesses and income generating activities, which have left populations even more 
vulnerable.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">On the economy, the exchange rate of the South Sudanese Pound (SSP) against the 
US Dollar strengthened through the first two months of 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">However, the collapse of the oil 
prices, reflecting the global economic downturn relating to the recent COVID-19 pandemic has 
led to a drastic decline in oil revenues.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">This will have a serious negative impact on the country’s 
budget and on the government’s capacity to finance the implementation of the R-ARCSS. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">The  RJMEC  interim  chairperson  engaged  key  stakeholders  in  efforts  to  quicken  the  pace  of 
implementation of the Pre-Transitional tasks and help to realise the formation of the RTGoNU. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">The leadership provided briefings to the IGAD Council of Ministers and Africa Union Peace 
and  Security  Council  (AUPSC),  conducted  separate  consultations  with  the  Parties  to  the 
Agreement, the Stakeholders and the Regional guarantors and diplomatic community, and held 
meetings with H.E. Salva Kiir Mayardit, the President of the Republic of South Sudan, Dr Riek 
Machar, First Vice President, and the other members of the Presidency.   
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">Overall  the  implementation  of  the  Transitional  Period  started  well  and  looked  promising. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">However, the few teething problems have slowed down progress and the Interim Chairperson 
of RJMEC is engaging with the Parties to break the deadlocks to allow for the implementation 
of the Agreement.

I. Introduction 

1.  </a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">This  Report  on  the  status  of  implementation  of  the  Pre-Transitional  tasks  of  the  Revitalised 
Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict  in  the Republic of South  Sudan (R-ARCSS) is 
prepared pursuant to Chapter VII, Article 7.9 of the R-ARCSS and covers the period 1st January 
to 31st March 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">It builds on the previous quarterly reports published since the signing of the 
R-ARCSS  on  12th  September  2018,  namely  numbers  001/19,  002/19,  003/19,  004/19  and 
005/19.1 
 

2.  </a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">After a little over seventeen months of the Pre-Transitional Period, the Revitalised Transitional 
Government  of  National  Unity  (RTGoNU)  was  established  on  22nd  February  2020  with  the 
swearing  in  of  the  First  Vice  President  and  three  of  the  four  Vice  Presidents.2  The  Report, 
therefore,  highlights  the  activities  leading  up  to  and  the  eventual  resolution  of  the  key  Pre-
Transitional tasks that resulted in the formation of the RTGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">Key to the resolution was a 
breakthrough in the determination of the number of States, which was agreeable to all the Parties 
to the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">At the same time, the Parties also agreed to allow a key Pre-Transitional task 
that of the screening, training and redeployment of at least 83 000 Necessary Unified Forces 
(NUF), to continue during the Transitional Period. 
 

3.  </a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">In addition, the Report highlights the successful formation of the RTGoNU and points to early 
violations of the R-ARCSS including the Parties’ failure to strictly adhere to the 35% women 
participation at all levels of the executive.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">Beyond this violation, there is also the issue of the 
amended  Transitional  Constitution  that  was  assented  to  by  the  President  H.E  Salva  Kiir 
Mayardit.</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">There are significant changes to the Amendment Bill and hence the Act assented to 
by the President.</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">The National Constitutional Amendment Committee (NCAC) has indicated 
that the Amendment Act (No.6) 2020 does not conform to the R-ARCSS. 
 

4.  </a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">Overall the Parties succeeded in implementing all but 7 of the 63 Pre-Transitional activities.3 
Still  outstanding,  however,  is  the  determination  of  the  positions  at  the  State  and  local 
government levels according to the responsibility sharing ratio outlined in Article 1.16.1 of the 
R-ARCSS.4 There were also delays in the restructuring and reconstitution of the Transitional 
National Legislature (TNL), comprising both the Transitional National Legislative Assembly 
(TNLA) and the Council of States (CoS), as Parties failed to provide their nominees on time to 
the NCAC.

implementation of the R-ARCSS since its signing in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

<p><a id="115" name="115">The  SSOA  nominee  H.E  Hussien  Abdelbaggi  was 
sworn in a few days later. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">3 The Parrties generally agreed to pursue the outstanding Pre-Transitional tasks during the Transitional period. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">These tasks are included together with those of the Transitional Period in Annex B attached to this Report.  
4 The Responsibility Sharing Ratio in Article 1.16.1 is determined as follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">I-TGoNU 55%;</a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">SPLM/A-IO 27%;</a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">
</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">SSOA 10% and OPP 8%. 

5.  </a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">Some improvements were observed in the humanitarian situation with the continued voluntary 
return of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), and refugees as the security situation stabilised 
across  the  country.  </a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">However,  this  was  abruptly  halted  with  the  advent  of  the  COVID-19 
pandemic.  </a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">With  regards  to  the  economy,  plummeting  world  oil  prices  severely  impacted 
government  revenues  and  continue  to  pose  an  ongoing  threat  to  the  implementation  of  the 
Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">

 

6.  Section II of the Report will provide highlights of the prevailing political, security, humanitarian 
and  economic  situation  in  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan.  </a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">Section  III  focuses  on  the  status  of 
implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS,  while  Section  IV  highlights  RJMEC’s  engagements  in 
enhancing  its  mandate  of  monitoring  and  evaluation.  </a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">Finally,  Section  V  presents  RJMEC’s 
observations and recommendations.</a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">The Report’s conclusion is in Section VI.

<p><a id="130" name="130">7.  </a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">On 15th February 2020, President Salva Kiir announced his decision to return the Republic of 
South Sudan from 32 States to 105.</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">The President also announced three administrative areas in 
the country to consist of Abyei Administrative Area (AAA), Greater Pibor Administrative Area 
(GPAA) and Ruweng Administrative Area (RAA).</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">The resolution of the number of states and 
their boundaries, and the assent of the President to the Constitutional Amendment Bill (No. 6) 
2020 on 19th February 2020 were, among others, critical issues necessary for the formation of 
the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity (RTGoNU) on 22nd February 2020.  
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">8.  </a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">On this day, the RTGoNU was partially constituted following the swearing into office of the 
First Vice President H.E Dr Riek Machar Teny and three of the four Vice Presidents, namely 
H.E. Wani Igga, H.E. Gen. Taban Deng Gai and H.E. Rebecca Nyandeng De’Mabior.6</a></p>
<p><a id="136" name="136">A day 
later, the remaining Vice President H.E. Abdelbagi Hussein Akol was sworn in.</a></p>
<p><a id="137" name="137">This signalled 
the official start of the Transitional Period and the end of the Pre-Transitional Period, which had 
lasted for one year, five months and six days, compared to the eight months envisaged in the 
Agreement.7 The Transitional Period is expected to last for thirty-six (36) months with general 
elections to be held at least 60 days prior to the expiry of the Transitional Period.  

 

5 Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Western Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap, Unity, Lakes, Jonglei, Western Equatoria, Central 
Equatoria, Eastern Equatoria, and Upper Nile.

<p><a id="138" name="138">The First Vice President was sworn in consistent with Article 1.7.1, which allows for the office to continue for 
the duration of the Transition and cease to exist at the end of the Transitional Period unless otherwise decided in 
the  Permanent  Constitution.  </a></p>
<p><a id="139" name="139">Article  1.7.2  points  to  the  Chairman  of  the  SPLM/A-IO  Dr  Riek  Machar  being 
appointed for the duration of the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="140" name="140">With regards to the Vice Presidents Article 1.8.1 establishes 
the office of four Vice Presidents who shall be equal in rank and their offices shall cease to exist at the conclusion 
of the Transitional Period.</a></p>

between armed forces of the defected SPLM/A-IO Maj Gen James Ochan Puot (now aligned to 
the  SSPDF)  and  the  5th  Infantry  Division  of  the  SPLM/A-IO8,  an  immediate  ceasefire  was

enable  them  to  join  in  the  South  Sudan  peace  process.  </a></p>

23.</a></p>
<p><a id="219" name="219">During the period, UNHCR maintained its “non return” advisory owing to the absence of basic

<p><a id="220" name="220">Despite this, there were continued voluntary returns by refugees and IDPs 
with  most  recorded  returns  originating  from  refugee  camps  in  Uganda  and  Sudan.  </a></p>
<p><a id="221" name="221">UNMISS

<p><a id="246" name="246">The  exchange  rate  of  the  South  Sudanese  Pound  (SSP)  against  the  US  Dollar  strengthened 
markedly  through  the  first  two  months  of  2020.  </a></p>
<p><a id="247" name="247">However,  the  collapse  of  the  oil  prices, 
reflecting the global economic downturn relating to the recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to 
a drastic decline in oil revenues.</a></p>
<p><a id="248" name="248">South Sudan’s oil revenues were budgeted at around US $ 55 
per barrel for the current budget year, but at the end of March, the price had fallen to less than 
US $ 25.</a></p>
<p><a id="249" name="249">The loss of revenues, if it persists, maybe considerable and budgeting will become 
very challenging. 
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="250" name="250">29.</a></p>
<p><a id="251" name="251">The oil price, and thereby oil revenues, were at, or above the budgeted price of around US $55 
until the end of February.  </a></p>
<p><a id="252" name="252">Subsequently in the three last weeks of March  oil prices plunged 
reaching US $ 23 on 31st March.</a></p>
<p><a id="253" name="253">At this price level, South Sudan is allowed to postpone part of 
the transfer payments it makes to Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="254" name="254">Taking this into account, it is estimated that if the price 
should remain at  the present  level,  the net  revenues will be reduced by two-thirds compared 
with what was budgeted.</a></p>

30.</a></p>
<p><a id="257" name="257">Selected information on budget execution during the first half of the budget year presented by 
the  Ministry  of  Finance  indicate  that  gross  revenues  (that  is  before  transfers  to  Sudan)  were 
close to the budgeted amount as a result of a higher than budgeted oil price and despite lower 
oil production levels.</a></p>
<p><a id="258" name="258">However, due to higher than budgeted transfers to Sudan, net revenues 
were close to 20 per cent lower than budgeted.</a></p>

pay the contracted amount.</a></p>
<p><a id="263" name="263">This means that it may take from four to six weeks or more before 
a change in the oil price is reflected in the cash flow.</a></p>

at the end of February, which was around US $ 55 per barrel.</a></p>

Article 1.15 and Annex E of the R-ARCSS set out the process for resolving the issue on the Number of States and their boundaries, which was the major issue upon which the Parties could not reach agreement during the High Level Revitalization Process.</a></p>
<p><a id="331" name="331">The R-ARCSS allowed for the setting up of a Technical Boundary Committee (TBC) (Articles 1.15.18.1 - 1.15.18.7) and an Independent Boundaries Commission (IBC) (Articles 1.15.1 – 1.15.16), to resolve the issue.</a></p>
<p><a id="332" name="332">The TBC focused its efforts to list and map the tribal areas of South Sudan as they stood on 1st January 1956 with a focus on addressing the tribal boundaries violated as a consequence of the establishment of the thirty-two (32) States.</a></p>
<p><a id="333" name="333">The TBC’s Report was presented to the IBC, which ultimately failed to reach consensus among its members and thus reverted to the IGAD Executive Secretary in July 2019.  </a></p>
<p><a id="334" name="334">The IBC however, recommended to IGAD that the issue should be decided by the Parties without reverting to a referendum as detailed in Articles 1.15.15 – 1.15.16.</a></p>
<p><a id="335" name="335">Several political initiatives with the Parties were subsequently undertaken, including the formation of a committee of representatives of the Parties to resolve the matter, following one of the bilateral meetings between President Salva Kiir Mayardit and Dr. Riek Machar Teny.</a></p>
<p><a id="336" name="336">However, the committee was formed but failed to convene due to disagreements on procedural matters.</a></p>
<p><a id="337" name="337">On 21st August 2019,  the IGAD Council of Ministers summoned the Parties to Addis Ababa in an attempt to resolve the outstanding issue, and to report on the same to the next Ordinary Summit of the IGAD Heads of Government, by end-September 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="338" name="338">Unfortunately, the Parties were unable to agree on modalities for convening the follow-up discussions and consequently failed to meet.</a></p>
<p><a id="339" name="339">Following the aborted consultative meeting, during the 69th Extra-Ordinary Session of the IGAD Council of Ministers on 10th November 2019, Ambassador Ismail Wais, the IGAD Special Envoy for South Sudan  was directed to facilitate a meeting of the Parties “to resolve the issue of the number of states and their boundaries and any other outstanding issues pertaining to the establishment of the RTGoNU.”</a></p>
<p><a id="340" name="340">Such a meeting was convened over a three-day period in Juba from 2nd – 4th December 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="341" name="341">It was Chaired by H.E David Mabuza, Deputy President of South Africa, and involved the participation of the Regional Special Envoys.</a></p>
<p><a id="342" name="342">Follow up meetings on 14th – 16th January 2020, and 5th February 2020 failed to reach agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="343" name="343">However Tripartite discussions proposed during IGAD’s 34th Extraordinary Summit, which were held to deliberate on the number of States finally yielded results.</a></p>
<p><a id="344" name="344">The Tripartite discussion proposed reverting to ten states, and the Summit agreed with the request of President Kiir to return to Juba to consult with his constituents.</a></p>
<p><a id="345" name="345">In a letter dated 15th February 2020, President Salva Kiir informed IGAD that he had accepted its proposal to revert the country from 32 to 10 States, thus clearing the way for the formation of the RTGoNU one week later.   </a></p>

<p><a id="352" name="352">Conditions in the training centres have been less than ideal as outlined in Box 2, which points 
to  a  series  of  challenges  that  require 
urgent  attention  on  the  part  of  the 
authorities.  </a></p>
<p><a id="353" name="353">Key 
those 
challenges are the logistics support to 
the centres and the presence of a large 
number of families including women 
and  children.  </a></p>
<p><a id="354" name="354">Morale  in  the  training 
centres

considering  the  very  austere  and 
challenging  conditions.  </a></p>
<p><a id="355" name="355">Overall,  the 
behaviour of the forces has been good 
with few breaches of discipline which 
indicates effective command, control 
and  personnel  management  of  the 
diverse  group  of  trainees  by  the 
training staff.</a></p>
<p><a id="356" name="356">In addition, trainees are 
in mixed government and opposition 
groups  and  there  are  no  badges  of 
rank during the training process.</a></p>
<p><a id="357" name="357">It is also important to note that some, but not all centres have 
a reasonable balance between Government and Opposition forces.</a></p>

<p><a id="373" name="373">Importantly,  there  has  been  a  recent  improvement  in  the  distribution  of  resources  from  the 
former NPTC storage sites in Juba to the training centres.</a></p>
<p><a id="374" name="374">This occurred after responsibility for

<p><a id="375" name="375">

<p><a id="377" name="377">Mechanisms for Security Arrangements 

43.</a></p>
<p><a id="378" name="378">The mechanisms for security arrangements during the Pre-Transitional period were under the 
direction of the NPTC.</a></p>
<p><a id="379" name="379">This included the Joint Defence Board (JDB), Joint Military Ceasefire 
Commission  (JMCC),  Joint  Transitional  Security  Committee  (JTSC),  Strategic  Defence  and 
Security Review Board (SDSRB), and Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) 
Commission.</a></p>
<p><a id="380" name="380">The other security mechanism the Ceasefire Transitional Security Monitoring and 
Verification  Mechanism  (CTSAMVM)  operates  independently  and  reports  directly  to  IGAD 
and RJMEC.  
 

44.</a></p>
<p><a id="381" name="381">With the commencement of the Transitional Period, the role of the NPTC will be taken over by 
a  new  mechanism  referred  to  as  the  National  Transitional  Committee  to  Coordinate 
Implementation  of  the  Security  Arrangements  (NTCCISA),  which  was  established  on  26th 
March 2020, through Republican Decree</a></p>
<p><a id="382" name="382">No. 10/2020.</a></p>

<p><a id="387" name="387">During the reporting period, the JDB started conducting periodical coordination meetings with 
the  other  security  mechanisms  to  which  IGAD,  RJMEC,  CTSAMVM  and  UNMISS  were 
invited as observers.</a></p>
<p><a id="388" name="388">The improved oversight from the JDB has already contributed to better 
logistics  planning  and  is  expected  to  lead  to  improved  allocation  of  resources  and 
implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="389" name="389">However, the recommendation from RJMEC that the Mechanisms establish a 
joint operations/logistics coordination centre within the Department of Defence and under the 
direction of the JDB has yet to be actioned.

<p><a id="390" name="390">The JTSC issued a directive on 25th March 2020 on safety measures at the training centres, in

<p><a id="392" name="392">Increased general safety and hygiene measures were also adopted

<p><a id="393" name="393">The restrictions on movement resulting from COVID-19 pandemic

2020.  </a></p>
<p><a id="402" name="402">Notwithstanding  the  challenges,  its  priorities  during  the  quarter  were  to  monitor  the

V.   Observations and Recommendations 

76.</a></p>
<p><a id="583" name="583">The  formation  of  the  RTGoNU  on  22nd  February  2020  marked  the  commencement  of  the 
Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="584" name="584">This ushered in the beginning of a new era for the people of South Sudan. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="585" name="585">It  has  not  however  been  without  its  challenges.  </a></p>
<p><a id="586" name="586">Reports  of  violations  to  the  R-ARCSS  with 
respect to the changes in the Constitutional Amendment Act (No. 6) 2020, and those pertaining 
to ambassadorial and the appointment of the Undersecretary in the Ministry of Petroleum is a 
cause of concern.</a></p>
<p><a id="587" name="587">RJMEC interim chairperson, therefore, urges that the procedures outlined in 
the R-ARCSS be closely adhered to in the making of political appointments.</a></p>
<p><a id="588" name="588">These should be 
observed in collegial collaboration, continuous consultation and joint decision making within 
the Presidency.21  
 

77.</a></p>
<p><a id="589" name="589">In March 2020, the Parties to the Revitalized Agreement agreed on the allocation and selection 
of  the  ministerial  and  deputy  ministerial  portfolios  following  inter-party  consultations.</a></p>
<p><a id="590" name="590">

21 Articles 1.6.2.15, 1.9.1, 1.9.2 and 4.2.3 of the R-ARCSS and Articles 101 and 164 of the Transitional 
Constitution clearly indicates the process to be adopted for political appointments within the RTGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="591" name="591">

 

 

  
 19 

Consequently, the Council of Ministers of the RTGoNU were appointed and sworn into office. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="592" name="592">This political development was preceded by President Salva Kiir reverting the number of States 
from 32 to 10 and assenting to the Constitutional Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2020 as well as the 
establishment  of  the  RTGoNU’s  Presidency.  </a></p>
<p><a id="593" name="593">However,  the  Parties’  nominations  were 
inconsistent  with  the  35%  mandatory  provision  for  women  appointment  to  the  Council  of 
Ministers  (26%) and as  deputy  ministers (10%).  </a></p>
<p><a id="594" name="594">The  ITGoNU and SPLM/A-IO fell short of 
adhering to  the requirement  to  nominate at  least  three (3) women as deputy  ministers of the 
RTGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="595" name="595">It is important that the Parties immediately address this inconsistency and remedy 
the situation pursuant to Articles 1.12.2 and 1.12.5 of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="596" name="596">

 

78.</a></p>
<p><a id="597" name="597">The appointments of the members of the Presidency and the Council of Ministers are significant 
steps towards the full establishment of the RTGoNU’s structure and composition.</a></p>
<p><a id="598" name="598">It is, however, 
regrettable  that  delays  have  persisted  in  the  reconstitution  of  the  TNL,  notwithstanding  that 
Article 1.14.6 determines that its term should run concurrently with that of the RTGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="599" name="599">The 
failure  of  the  Parties  to  provide  to  the  NCAC  their  nominees  to  the  TNLA  has  led  to  an 
unnecessary delay in the reconstitution of this critical arm of the unity government.</a></p>
<p><a id="600" name="600">In addition, 
the delayed resolution to assigning positions to the State and local government levels, under the 
responsibility sharing formula, has severely constrained the formation of the Council of States. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="601" name="601">The Parties should therefore act quickly to provide their nominees to the NCAC and make the 
necessary  concessions  on  the  positions  at  the  State  and  local  Government  levels,  in  order  to 
enable the formation of the TNL and the remaining structures of the RTGoNU.  

 

79.</a></p>
<p><a id="602" name="602">The NPTC was responsible for providing direction, coordination and overall supervision of all 
the  other  institutions  and  implementation  mechanisms  during  the  Pre-Transitional  Period. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="603" name="603">However, to  a large extent,  it failed to  meet  its responsibilities  with regard to  the respective 
security mechanisms;</a></p>
<p><a id="604" name="604">in particular in terms of ensuring proper accountability and management 
of expenditure of funds;</a></p>
<p><a id="605" name="605">in failing to provide adequate funds to meet the agreed implementation 
plans for the security mechanisms and in delaying allocating the agreed necessary funds which, 
when it was eventually disaggregated, fell far short of the specific needs of some mechanisms 
(e.g. the JMCC and JTSC).   

 

80.</a></p>
<p><a id="606" name="606">Whereas  the  fund  transfers  and  donations,  as  well  as  the  in-kind  support  to  the  NPTC, 
significantly contributed in facilitating the implementation of the Pre-Transitional tasks, they 
were insufficient for all the enormous tasks at hand.</a></p>
<p><a id="607" name="607">Consequently, implementation of some of 
the tasks of the Pre-Transitional Period could not be completed in a timely manner as provided 
for in the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="608" name="608">The failure of the NPTC to provide adequate direction, coordination and 
supervision  of  the  security  mechanisms  led  them  to  operate  independently  from  each  other, 
working to a large part in ‘silos’ and failing to synchronise and coordinate their activities.  </a></p>
<p><a id="609" name="609">As 
a result, lack of effective coordination between the JMCC and the JTSC was apparent almost 
from the outset with each mechanism attributing failure to the other.</a></p>
<p><a id="610" name="610">

 

 

 

  
 20 

81.</a></p>
<p><a id="611" name="611">Furthermore, the NPTC was unable to effectively manage and coordinate the management of 
in-kind  aid  from  donor  nations and the timely provision  of food, medical  supplies and other 
essential resources to both cantonment sites and training centres.  </a></p>
<p><a id="612" name="612">As a consequence, the JDB 
assumed responsibility of the NPTC controlled warehouses in January 2020 and since then there 
has  been  gradual,  yet  significant,  improvement  in  logistical  planning  and  allocation  of  vital 
resources  to  the  various  cantonment  sites  and  training  centres,  although  this  still  remains  a 
considerable challenge.  
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="613" name="613">82.</a></p>
<p><a id="614" name="614">It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  SSM,  established  by  the  principal  Guarantors  to  the  R-
ARCSS to ‘boost’ the implementation process and assist the respective security mechanisms in 
resolving  the  stumbling  blocks  and  identifying  and  meeting  their  respective  challenges, 
provided little or no evidence of any substantive progress at the 50-days period.  </a></p>
<p><a id="615" name="615">However, with 
the eventual release of funds by the ITGoNU to the NPTC and the subsequent disbursement to 
the respective Security Mechanisms on the 3rd January and with an expectation of results before 
the end of the 100-day extension period, there has been some progress in the implementation of 
the TSAs and more evidence of commitment shown than hitherto by the Security Mechanisms. 

 

83.</a></p>
<p><a id="616" name="616">The reported closure of some cantonment sites is an area of deep concern, as cantonments need 
to remain operational to administer those not selected for the NUF training, those who do not 
complete the training, and who have elected to join the DDR process, at a time when the DDR 
is not operational.</a></p>
<p><a id="617" name="617">The observation made of an increase in the number of families locating in or 
close to cantonment sites also remains a cause of concern from a humanitarian perspective and 
many of these dependants of combatants have now moved (or are moving) to training centres 
in  search of safety, shelter and food.</a></p>
<p><a id="618" name="618">RJMEC continues to  emphasize the seriousness  of this 
issue to RTGoNU and the International Community.</a></p>
<p><a id="619" name="619">This Humanitarian issue has now taken on 
an added dimension given the presence of COVID-19 in the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="620" name="620"> 

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="621" name="621">84.</a></p>
<p><a id="622" name="622">Parties should refrain from accepting into their ranks soldiers who are defecting and changing 
alliances as this can only undermine implementation of the permanent security arrangements 
and the momentum of trust and confidence-building among the Parties to the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="623" name="623">

 

85.</a></p>
<p><a id="624" name="624">The threat of the COVID-19 pandemic adds to the humanitarian concerns as large numbers of 
trainees are confined at the various sites, and centres which are in close proximity to surrounding 
communities.</a></p>
<p><a id="625" name="625">Although restrictions on movement have been instituted by the High-Level Task 
Force on COVID-19, there is  a need for awareness campaigns and provision of hygiene and 
sanitation facilities at the various training centres and cantonment sites.</a></p>
<p><a id="626" name="626">These responses are a 
matter  of  urgency  especially  since  the  DDR  process  is  yet  to  be  established  to  take  care  of 
combatants found to be unfit to join the National Unified Forces. 

 

86.</a></p>
<p><a id="627" name="627">The establishment of the NUF in Phase 1 is seen as a provisional arrangement principally to 
demonstrate  political  will  for  the  unification  of  the  South  Sudanese  defence,  security  and 
organised forces and not the integration of existing armed forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="628" name="628">Formal training of the NUF 
and the VIP Protection Force, as per the agreed curriculum for each of the organized forces in 

 

  
 21 

accordance  with  Chapter  II  of  the  R-ARCSS,  has  still  not  commenced  and  screening  of 
personnel (including medical screening) is not yet complete.</a></p>
<p><a id="629" name="629"> 

 

87.</a></p>
<p><a id="630" name="630">The  recent  announcement  by  RTGoNU  of  the  establishment  of  the  National  Transitional 
Committee to Coordinate Implementation of Security Arrangements is a hopeful sign that the 
RTGoNU will address  and complete the pending  security  tasks,  particularly the  training and 
redeployment of the NUF  and the Strategic Defence Review.</a></p>
<p><a id="631" name="631">Its first task is to produce a clear 
action plan including goals and timeline for the completion of unification.</a></p>
<p><a id="632" name="632">

<p><a id="634" name="634">Conclusion 

88.</a></p>
<p><a id="635" name="635">The  Agreement  Parties  have  come  a  long  way  since  the  signing  of  the  R-ARCSS  on  12th 
September 2018 in restoring South Sudan to lasting peace.</a></p>
<p><a id="636" name="636">With the ongoing efforts to fully set 
up the RTGoNU’s composition and structures, there is still room for compromise.</a></p>
<p><a id="637" name="637">Indeed, the 
gains made to date should not be taken for granted and the onus is on the Agreement Parties to 
work together within the RTGoNU to implement all the activities of the Transitional Period. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="638" name="638">The early missteps linked to the violations of the Agreement must give way to collegiality and 
joint decision making as spelt out in the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="639" name="639">Now more than ever is the time to exercise 
and sustain the political will that has so far carried the implementation of the R-ARCSS to this 
stage. 
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="640" name="640">89.  </a></p>
<p><a id="641" name="641">Already,  the  RTGoNU  is  faced  with  the  daunting  task  of  successfully  negotiating  its  way 
through  the  challenges  posed  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  persistent  decline  in 
government revenues linked to the fall in oil prices.</a></p>
<p><a id="642" name="642">There is, therefore, the need to seek the 
support  of  the  international  community,  partners  and  the  friends  of  South  Sudan  while 
demonstrating commitment to tackle the many fiscal and financial reforms laid out in Chapter 
IV of the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="643" name="643">This will allow for the channelling of additional resources and lay the 
foundation  for  sustained  growth.  </a></p>
<p><a id="644" name="644">Both  effects  will  impact  positively  on  the  humanitarian 
situation and expedite safe and voluntary return of the refugees from neighbouring countries. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="645" name="645">This can only help set the tone for a successful Transitional Period and the ultimate conduct of 
credible elections before the expiry of the transitional period. 

 

90.</a></p>
<p><a id="646" name="646">RJMEC on its part shall continue to impartially monitor, evaluate and report as it carries out its 
oversight responsibilities with regards to the implementation of the R-ARCSS, and intervene 
whenever necessary.</a></p>
<p><a id="647" name="647">RJMEC will also continue providing regular reports and briefings to the 
RTGoNU, the TNLA, the Chairperson of the IGAD Council of Ministers, the Chairperson of 
the African Union Commission, the AU Peace and Security Council, and to the UN Secretary-
General and the United Nations Security Council.</a></p>
