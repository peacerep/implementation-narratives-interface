Executive Summary
•</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">Following the receipt of flash reports from the Monitoring and Verification Team (MVT)
based in Bor, which implied a violation of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement
(COHA) in Bor, Jonglei State on 17 April 2014, the JTC initiated a formal investigation
and verification process on the same day.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">The results of the investigation and
verification process are contained in this report.
</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">•</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">Reports indicate that hostilities between armed demonstrators, loyal to the
Government of South Sudan, and internally displaced people (IDPs) began at the
UNMISS Protection of Civilians (POC) site in Bor at approximately 0930hrs on 17 April
2014.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The hostilities resulted in the death of 58 people inside the POC site, with over
100 injured.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">One of the dead attackers was reported as wearing a security force
uniform (South Sudan National Police Service).</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">There were also reports of dead
bodies outside the perimeter of the POC site, which were removed by the government
authorities by 18 April.
</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">•</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">The leader of the demonstrators (turned attackers) is not known.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">Although military
forces loyal to the Government of South Sudan were sighted in the vicinity of the
UNMISS camp as demonstrators converged, there is no evidence to suggest they
were directly involved in the attack.
</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">•</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">As a result of ongoing investigations, including the first-hand accounts from the
Monitoring and Verification Team (MVT) based in the UNMISS compound in Bor, it is
the opinion of the JTC that armed personnel, loyal to the Government of South Sudan,
violated the following articles of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, 23 January
2014, on 17 April 2014:</a></p>
