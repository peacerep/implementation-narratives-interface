conducted over large areas of land for protracted periods.</a></p>

with the insecurity.</a></p>

<p><a id="48" name="48">The violation is assessed as a local level sequence of events which has impacted
on the civilian population of Boma and Jonglei states.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">The TGoNU response has been
to de-escalate the violence by removing SPLA-IG forces and armed groups from
flashpoints and to sponsor a regional peace initiative.

7.1.</a></p>
