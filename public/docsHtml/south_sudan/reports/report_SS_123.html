<p><a id="28" name="28">This  Report  covers  the  period  from  July  1st  to  September  30th,  2018  with  highlights  of  the 
closing months of the High Level Revitalization Forum (HLRF) culminating in the signing of 
the Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-
ARCSS) on September 12, 2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">Throughout the process, JMEC Advisors provided support to 
the IGAD Special Envoy through secondment to the HLRF Taskforce.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">In addition the Report 
highlights  the  prevailing,  security,  humanitarian  and  economic  situation  in  the  country  and 
presents  a  series  of  observations  and  makes  recommendations  to  address  some  of  the 
impediments to implementation.</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">2.  </a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">Since the signing the Chairperson of JMEC and the IGAD Special Envoy separately wrote to 
all the parties and stakeholders of the R-ARCSS to bring to their attention immediate obligations 
critical  for  the  implementation  of  the  Agreement  during  the  Pre-Transitional  Period  and  in 
preparation for the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">They were urged to submit the names of nominees to 
various Agreement institutions and mechanisms, and reminded of the key commitments to be 
observed immediately.</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">3.  </a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">Among some of the tasks completed by the end of September is the disseminated by JMEC of 
printed copies of the Agreement, ratification by most of the parties, celebration of the signing 
in Khartoum involving the leadership of the Parties to the R-ARCSS and Stakeholders as part 
of  confidence  building  measures,  and  the  appointment  of  members  to  the  National  Pre-

<p><a id="39" name="39">4.  </a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">Although some progress has been made in implementing the R-ARCSS several tasks were still 
outstanding  at  the  end  of  the  period  including  the  ratification  of  the  R-ARCSS  by  the 
Transitional  National  Legislature  (TNL),  approval  of  the  RJMEC  Terms  of  Reference  and 
appointment  of  a  new  Chairperson,  as  well  as  establishment  of  most  of  the  institutions  and 
mechanisms.

to the conflict continued fighting in some parts of South Sudan during the reporting period.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">At 
the same time the humanitarian situation remains precarious.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">There are some improvements on 
the economic front.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">The exchange rate, which had depreciated rapidly in the previous quarter 
rose appreciably from the end of June and has subsequently remained stable contributing to a 
slowing of inflation.</a></p>

<p><a id="49" name="49">He 
reflected on the HLRF process  revealing that it had come  a long  way, starting from internal

<p><a id="50" name="50">The signing of the R-ARCSS provides a tremendous opportunity to bring lasting peace to South 
Sudan.  </a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">It,  however,  will  call  for  a  commitment  from  all  the  parties  to  live  up  to  their 
commitments made during the signing process.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">To this end the parties should quickly complete 
their  nominations  to  the  various  Agreement  institutions  and  mechanisms,  and  IGAD  should 
have them reconstituted to start their work.</a></p>

deliberations within JMEC culminating in his recommendation and the historic decision taken 
by  the  Assembly  during  its  31st  Extra-Ordinary  Summit  on  12th  June  2017  to  convene  the 
Forum.  </a></p>

process.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">Also at the Summit the Heads of State noted that the tenure of Chairman H E Festus

<p><a id="100" name="100">Revitalization of the Peace Agreement 

Overview 

14.  </a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">In June 2017 the IGAD Heads of State and Government approved JMEC’s recommendation to 
convene  a  High-Level  Revitalization  Forum  (HLRF)  of  the  Parties  to  the  Agreement  on  the 
Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (ARCSS), including estranged groups 
to  discuss  concrete  measures  to  restore  the  permanent  ceasefire,  full  implementation  of  the 
peace  agreement  and  develop  revised  realistic  timelines  and  an  implementation  schedule 
towards democratic elections at the end of the Transitional Period.  
 

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">The HLRF culminated with the signing of the Peace Agreement on September 12, 2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">The 
Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan  (R-
ARCSS) was signed with the participation of most of the parties involved in the negotiations. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">Throughout the process, JMEC Advisors provided support to the IGAD Special Envoy through 
secondment  to  the  HLRF  Taskforce,  while  others  contributed  on  an  ad-hoc  basis,  especially 
during the final stages of the negotiations.  
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">Developments since the signing 

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">Just  one  week  after  the  signing  the  JMEC  HLRF  taskforce  met  with  the  State  Minister  for 
Foreign Affairs of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, representing the Chairperson 
of the IGAD Council of Ministers to reflect on the HLRF process and outcomes, discuss the R-
ARCSS 2018 implementation matrix and the way forward.  

 

17.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">At  the  time  a  list  of  priority  actions  required  from  IGAD,  as  the  Mediator,  to  kick-start 
immediate  implementation  of  the  Agreement  was  compiled.  </a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">The  list  was  subsequently 
submitted to the Office of the Chairperson IGAD Council of Ministers on September 18, 2018. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">Among the priority areas was the need to immediately complete the nomination process and 
thereafter launch the critical Agreement Institutions and Mechanisms particularly the National 
Pre-Transitional  Committee  (NPTC),  National  Constitutional  Amendment  Committee 
(NCAC);</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110"> </a></p>

<p><a id="115" name="115">

 

18.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">Consequently, the Chairperson of JMEC and the IGAD Special Envoy separately wrote to all 
the parties and stakeholders of the R-ARCSS to bring to their attention immediate obligations 
critical  for  the  implementation  of  the  Agreement  during  the  Pre-Transitional  Period  and  in 
preparation  for  the  Transitional  Period.  </a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">They  were  urged  to  submit  the  names  of  nominees 
taking into account the need to give due consideration to national diversity, gender and regional 
representation.  </a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">In  addition,  they  were  reminded  of  the  key  commitments  to  be  observed 
immediately (See Box 1 Below).</a></p>

<p><a id="216" name="216">The 
exchange rate, which had depreciated rapidly in the previous quarter rose appreciably from the 
end of June and has subsequently remained stable at around SSP 200 to the US dollar.</a></p>
<p><a id="217" name="217">Largely 
as a consequence of this development, trend inflation has slowed somewhat.</a></p>
<p><a id="218" name="218">Another positive 
development relates to the increasing world oil prices which have also helped ease inflation.</a></p>
<p><a id="219" name="219">It 
has contributed as well to an improved government fiscal situation.</a></p>
<p><a id="220" name="220">

<p><a id="221" name="221">Arrears  owed  to  Sudan  on  account  of  previously  missed  payments  has  been  extinguished

<p><a id="226" name="226">To date there has not been a noticeable increase in capital expenditures, which is a necessary

<p><a id="227" name="227">Also with the signing of the R-ARCSS government is 
expected to deposit a significant amount towards the funding of the pre-transitional period.</a></p>
<p><a id="228" name="228">It 
remains to be seen the extent to which this obligation will be respected.</a></p>

27.</a></p>
<p><a id="231" name="231">The signing of the R-ARCSS offers an opportunity to forge a path towards economic growth 
and  development  for  the  country.  </a></p>
<p><a id="232" name="232">Meaningful  development  can  only  be  truly  realised  in  the 
absence of war and in a focused effort to  increase the share of capital expenditure,  stimulate 
agriculture production, mobilise oil and other revenue sources, and expand the private sector’s 
role in development.  
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="233" name="233">28.</a></p>
<p><a id="234" name="234">High inflation levels, deterioration of the exchange rate, and ballooning fiscal deficits continue 
to serve as major threats to the economic stability of the country.  </a></p>
<p><a id="235" name="235">Already the exchange rate 
appears  to  have  stabilised  against  the  US  dollar  and  this  will  help  in  pushing  inflation 
downwards.</a></p>
<p><a id="236" name="236">There is need to improve expenditure management, enact appropriate legislation, 
and further improve revenue collection to help stabilise the economy in the face of its daunting 
challenges.    </a></p>
<p><a id="237" name="237">Finally,  a  renewed  focus  on  implementing  the  recommendations  contained  in 
Chapter  IV  of  the  R-ARCSS  will  strengthen  public  financial  management,  enhance  the 
economic policy framework, and help drive the country’s economy towards sustained growth.  

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="238" name="238">V.   Observations and Recommendations 

29.</a></p>
<p><a id="239" name="239">The signing of the R-ARCSS provides a tremendous opportunity to bring lasting peace to South 
Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="240" name="240">It however will call for a commitment from all the parties to live up to their commitments 
made  during  the  signing  process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="241" name="241">To  this  end  the  parties  should  quickly  complete  their 
nominations to the various Agreement institutions and mechanisms.  
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="242" name="242">30.</a></p>
<p><a id="243" name="243">At the same time a quick reconstitution of all the mechanisms such a s the NPTC, NCAC, JSB 
and the various  Security Arrangements mechanisms must be advanced.</a></p>
<p><a id="244" name="244">Also, the parties to the 
Agreement that have committed to the freeing of POWs and political detainees must act with 
haste.</a></p>
<p><a id="245" name="245">This will serve to infuse a sense of trust into implementation of the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="246" name="246">
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="247" name="247">31.</a></p>
<p><a id="248" name="248">Violations of the CoHA and the R-ARCSS although dropping still continue and this must all 
stop.  </a></p>
<p><a id="249" name="249">To  this  end,  JMEC  welcomes  the  new  provision  in  the  R-ARCSS  Article  7.10,  which 
allows for the IGAD Council of Ministers to meet within 14 days of receiving a report from 
JMEC on serious violations or incidents contrary to the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="250" name="250">JMEC for its part intend to 
make full use of this provision.</a></p>
<p><a id="251" name="251">It further pledges to vigorously monitor implementation of the 
Agreement  and  to  work  closely  with  the  parties  in  dealing  with  any  impediments  to 
implementation.</a></p>

<p><a id="254" name="254">The signing of the inclusive Agreement sets the stage for economic stability and growth in South 
Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="255" name="255">The country’s pledge to increase oil production in Unity State as well as higher world 
oil prices are both positive steps in the right direction.</a></p>
<p><a id="256" name="256">However, the TGoNU needs to undertake 
expenditure reorientation away from military spending and continue to mobilise nonoil revenue 
sources in an effort to improve the country’s fiscal outlook.</a></p>
<p><a id="257" name="257">Already inflationary pressures have 
eased somewhat as the exchange rate strengthened against the US dollar.</a></p>
<p><a id="258" name="258">

 

33.</a></p>
<p><a id="259" name="259">The  Parties  to  the  R-ARCSS  must  seize  this  window  of  opportunity  and  engage  in 
implementation of the Agreement with vigour and demonstrable political commitment.</a></p>
<p><a id="260" name="260">Parallel 
to  this  the  international  community  should,  commensurate  to  political  commitment  from  the 
Parties, give the necessary political  and financial support to  the NPTC and other Agreement 
Institutions and Mechanisms;</a></p>
<p><a id="261" name="261">in order to ensure successful implementation.   

 

34.</a></p>
<p><a id="262" name="262">The lack of accountability mechanisms has contributed to the increase during the intervening 
period of the perpetration of egregious human rights violations and the commission of crimes 
under international humanitarian law.</a></p>
<p><a id="263" name="263">The process of establishing the Hybrid Court for South 
Sudan (HCSS) has stalled since December 2017 when the Cabinet approved the MoU for its 
establishment.  </a></p>
<p><a id="264" name="264">It  is  hoped  that  under  the  provisions  of  the  R-ARCSS  the  AUC  will  move 
forward on the matter of the HCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="265" name="265">If impunity is to be stemmed and the rule of law established, 
the AUC, UN, IGAD and TGoNU must address  the  establishment of Chapter 5 mechanisms 
with utmost urgency.  

 

35.</a></p>
<p><a id="266" name="266">The  National  Dialogue,  which  has  been  adopted  by  the  authorities  can,  if  properly  pursued, 
further contribute to peace in South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="267" name="267">The Chairman of the forum has outlined his plan to 
hold  National  Dialogue  consultations  in  various  regions  of  the  country.  </a></p>
<p><a id="268" name="268">A  commitment  by 
stakeholders and parties to take part in the consultations will go a long way to ensuring their 
success and help in national healing. 

 

VI.</a></p>
<p><a id="269" name="269">Conclusion 

36.</a></p>
<p><a id="270" name="270">At the end of fifteen difficult months of negotiation  an inclusive Peace  Agreement has been 
signed.  </a></p>
<p><a id="271" name="271">It  is  hoped  that  the  people  of  South  Sudan  will  finally  realise  a  complete  end  to 
hostilities, and a lasting and permanent peace.</a></p>
<p><a id="272" name="272">Now is the ideal opportunity to focus on reversing 
the desolate humanitarian situation and address conditions that have burdened and depressed 
the  economy.  </a></p>
<p><a id="273" name="273">No  doubt  the  people  of  South  Sudan  look  to  the  parties  of  the  latest  signed 
provisions implemented in letter and spirit, and push ahead with the realization of durable peace. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="274" name="274">There must be a renewed commitment from all stakeholders to adhere to the CoHA and to fully 
implement the R-ARCSS.  
 

37.</a></p>
<p><a id="275" name="275">The  NCAC  will  continue  to  execute  its  mandate  of  facilitating  the  necessary  legislative  and 
legal framework during the Pre-Transition and Transition Periods, which will ultimately result 
in  free  and  fair  elections  in  South  Sudan.  </a></p>
<p><a id="276" name="276">Similarly  CTSAMVM  will  continue  with  its 

 

11 

monitoring, verification and reporting activities in a timely fashion to JMEC and IGAD in order 
that the necessary action will be taken when required.   

 

38.</a></p>
<p><a id="277" name="277">JMEC on its part shall continue to monitor, evaluate and report as it vigorously carry out its 
oversight responsibilities with regards to the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="278" name="278">It will also continue regular reporting  
in writing to the TGoNU, the TNLA, the Chairperson of the IGAD Council of Ministers, the 
Chairperson of the African Union Commission, the Peace and Security Council of the AU, and 
to the Secretary General and Security Council of the UN.
