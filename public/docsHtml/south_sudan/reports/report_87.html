•</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">Dr Lam Akol’s passport (an ordinary South Sudanese passport) was not confiscated
by the Immigration Service
•</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">Dr Lam subsequently wrote formal letters of complaint to President Salva Kiir and the
IGAD Special Envoys, and also informed other stakeholders of the travel denial.
</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">4.0  Assessment
4.1     Reports indicate that GRSS deliberately prevented members of the PPLF from
traveling to Ethiopia to attend IGAD-led peace talks, in contravention of both the COHA and
ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">Similar incidents have occurred previously when GRSS prevented the SPLM/A-IO
representatives to the MVM from traveling to Ethiopia, despite invitations from IGAD.
</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">5.0  Conclusion
5.1      As a result of investigations, and the weight of evidence collated, it is the opinion of the
JTC that GRSS violated the following articles of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (23
January 2014) and the Agreement to Resolve the Crisis in South Sudan (09 May 2014) on 13
September 2014, in Juba (Central Equatoria State):
- COHA 2.0:</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">The parties shall cease hostile media and other propaganda
campaigns, including any action that may undermine the peace process
- ARCSS:</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">    </a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">(Parties) Agree to ensure the inclusion of all South Sudanese
stakeholders in the peace process, and the negotiation of a transitional government of
national unity, in order to ensure broad ownership of the agreed outcomes;</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">
</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">stakeholders include:</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">the two direct negotiators (GRSS and the SPLM/A in
Opposition), and others such as SPLM leaders (former detainees), political parties,
civil society, and faith-based leaders.
</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">5.0      It is therefore recommended that the IGAD Special Envoys take the appropriate action
against GRSS in response to the violations of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement and the
Agreement to Resolve the Crisis in South Sudan, and urge GRSS to allow members of the
PPLF to travel to the peace talks as soon as possible.
