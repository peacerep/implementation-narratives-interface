2.0  Investigation — findings

2.1  On 16 May 2017 there was a clash between the SPLA-IG and SPLA-IO (RM),
when the latter attacked the SPLA-IG checkpoint at KERGULU  km from YEI
town.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">It was reported that there were casualties on both sides.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">The checkpoint
was seized by SPLA-IO (RM) and held for some time until retaken by SPLA-IG.

2.2.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">The circumstances of the clash were confirmed by the MVT after speaking to
both SPLA-IG and SPLA-IO (RM).</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">The MVT met with SPLA-IG on the ground
and spoke with the SPLA-IO (RM) by telephone while the team were on the
patrol.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">The number of military casualties could not be verified.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">On 22 May the
team interviewed a civilian who stated that his relative had been killed in
KERGULU on the 16'" May in the crossfire between the forces.

2.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">On 22 May the MVT were informed of an attack on a SPLA-IG checkpoint at
KIMBA which took place at 0500 that day.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">Three soldiers were killed on the spot
and one died later that day.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">The MVT saw the scene of the ambush and the
pools of blood and were then taken to see the bodies of those killed.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">The police
and SPLA-IG claim that the attack was carried out by SPLM-IO (RM).</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">The MVT
was unable to confirm this with the SPLA -IO (RM), but all the evidence pointed
to their involvement.

</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">

3.1  </a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">It is the opinion of CTSAMM that the attack on the checkpoint on 16 May was
conducted by SPLM-IO (RM), and that in addition to military casualties a civilian
was probably also killed.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">

3.2  </a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">It is the opinion of the CTSAMM that because there is an active SPLA-IO (RM)
presence in YEI area which conducted a similar attack on 16 May it is very likely

that they are responsible for the attack on the KIMBA checkpoint on 22 May.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">

</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">4.0  Conclusion:</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">

4.1  It is the opinion of CTSAMM that the attacks which took place at KERGULU
and KIMBA were unprovoked and are a clear violation of the PCTSA by SPLA-
 (RM), particularly:</a></p>
