attacked first.</a></p>

Government Forces.

:</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">   Assessment

sources.</a></p>

albeit from the UNMISS camp.

and Bentiu very soon after the fighting died down.

<p><a id="52" name="52">Due to the nature of the engagement and the observations of the MVT, augmented by
other neutral reports — especially from UN sources, it is apparent that SPLM/A-IO

County, Unity State.
