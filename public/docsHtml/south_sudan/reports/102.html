CTSAMVM REPORT 2021/12
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The continued activities of NAS in Central and Western Equatoria States have led to
clashes with the SSPDF, and the suffering and displacement of the civilian population.
</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">CTSAMVM has reasonable grounds to believe that from April to June 2021 NAS
prosecuted at least  attacks against the SSPDF (four in Central Equatoria State and
two in Western Equatoria State, including at attack against the SSPDF unit at Loka
West which left 11 SSPDF soldiers dead).</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">These attacks were in clear violation of the
ACOH of December 2017, and have been conducted after the signing the Rome
Declaration and Resolution, and whilst the Rome process is ongoing.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">There were also other armed attacks reported against military and civil authorities, as
well as civilian targets, where CTSAMVM has so far been unable to confirm whether
or not NAS was involved, since there is also criminal activity in the area.
</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">CTSAMVM recommends that NAS adheres to the  ACOH, and implements the
provisions of the Rome Declaration and Resolution of 2020.
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">ALLEGED NAS ATTACKS IN CENTRAL AND WESTERN EQUATORIA
Introduction
1. Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">

a. Since the signing of the R-ARCSS, CTSAMVM has submitted 12 reports
attributing violations of the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities, Protection
of Civilians and Humanitarian Access in the Republic of South Sudan of 21
December 2017 (ACOH) either directly or jointly to NAS (TC).</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">This is over 20%
of the total number of reports submitted, and all refer to incidents in the
Equatorias.

b. Despite these reports, and the Ongoing mediation by The Community of
Sant'Egidio, violence has continued.  </a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">This has led to the displacement of
civilians and worsening of relations between communities and the SSPDF, who
only too often blame local people for supporting NAS and take heavy-handed
measures as a result.

</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">c. Ongoing clashes between alleged NAS forces and those of the SSPDF are
continuing to cause suffering amongst the people of the Equatorias.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">Although
NAS is not a signatory of the R-ARCSS, it did sign the ACOH of December
2017 which remains in force.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">NAS can be held accountable for violations
against the ACOH.

d. Because the provisions of the Rome Declaration and Resolution of 2020 have
yet to be implemented, CTSAMVM has no formal liaison with NAS, and as a
result often finds it difficult to fully investigate incidents allegedly involving NAS.
</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">Nevertheless, the provisions of the ACOH compel that those investigations
regarding alleged violations of the ACOH take place.

2. Aim</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">:</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">The aim of this report is to:</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">

3. Outline incidents allegedly involving NAS from April to June 2021 that have
been reported to  CTSAMVM, and which CTSAMVM has  endeavoured to
investigate.

4.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">Attribute  responsibility for violations of the ACOH and  R-ARCSS where
appropriate and possible, and to make recommendations.

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The information in this report is based on:</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">

a. Inputs from CTSAMVM MVT routine reports.

b. An investigation undertaken by the CTSAMVM MVT based in Yambio which
included visits to the areas of Maridi, Mundri and Kediba in Western Equatoria
State from 25-28 July 2021.

</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">c. An investigation undertaken  by the CTSAMVM MVT based in Yei which
involved visits to Loka West, Lainya and Limbe in Central Equatoria State from
25 to 28 August 2021.

d. During these investigations CTSAMVM  interviewed a wide range of civil
leaders, SSPDF officers and civilians.

</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">•. Limitations:</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">

i. Due to the reasons stated above (paragraph 1.d), CTSAMVM was unable
to interview representatives from NAS.

ii.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">Local people are reluctant to talk about NAS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">For example, CTSAMVM
interviewed a young man who had been abducted (allegedly by NAS) and
held for several weeks and made to carry loads through the bush.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">He was
unable — or unwilling — to positively identify his abductors as NAS.

 </a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">“|
f. Standard of proof:</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">The standard of proof used by CTSAMVM to determine
whether there is sufficient evidence to verify that a Party is not in compliance
with the provisions of the Agreements is “reasonable grounds to believe that
the incident that is the subject of the investigation occurred.”  This is in
accordance with accepted  practice for monitoring mechanisms  and
humanitarian entities and signifies that sufficient facts and evidence have been
collected to conclude that an event has occurred,

i. The attacks at GOLI were a continuation of the attacks and counter-
attacks between the SSPDF and NAS which started on 17 March 2021
when SSPDF forces from MORSAK attacked NAS forces in OMBASI
Boma as described in CTSAMVM report 2021/06.

ii, There was an ambush of SSPDF forces on  April near BEREKA.

Officers involved stated it was carried out by NAS.

iv.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">The ambush against an SSPDF vehicle on 24 May did take place.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">There
were no casualties.

Vv.</a></p>

June 2021 which resulted in the reported deaths of 11 SSPDF soldiers
and the displacement of many of the local people.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">A surviving officer

interviewed by CTSAMVM described the attack:</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">the fighting reportedly

" Brigade HQ SSPDF in LIMBE and with reinforcements repulsed the

officer and the commander of ° Brigade Ground Forces SSPDF were
insistent that NAS perpetrated the attack.</a></p>

that it was sometimes difficult to distinguish between NAS soldiers and
local civilians.

<p><a id="93" name="93">vi.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">CTSAMVM has so far been unable to find any information to support the
allegations that NAS was involved in attacks against civilian vehicles, and
      bi
the other incidents described above and not included in the findings of
this report.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">The situation since June 2021:</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96"> There have been fewer incidents reported since
June;</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">however, several incidents were reported in August which allegedly involved
NAS and which are being investigated by CTSAMVM

Assessment

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">Since the signing of the R-ARCSS the activities of NAS have been the major cause
of insecurity in southern Central Equatoria, and a significant cause of insecurity in
Western Equatoria.

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">Although it is difficult for CTSAMVM to obtain  conclusive evidence of NAS
involvement in incidents, there are reasonable grounds to believe that NAS have
been involved in planned attacks against SSPDF units, and the ambush of SSPDF
personnel.

11.As criminal elements may be operating in the area, not all incidents that may be
blamed on NAS can necessarily be attributed to NAS.

Conclusion

12.It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that from April to June 2021 NAS were
responsible for at least  attacks against the SSPDF in Central and Western
Equatoria States, and that these attacks constituted hostile military actions in clear
violation of the ACOH, specifically Article Three.

Observations and Recommendations

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">The attacks by NAS outlined in this report were not only in clear violation of the
ACOH of December 2017, but were also conducted after the signing the Rome

es
Declaration and Resolution and whilst the Rome Process is ongoing.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">This is
unacceptable and unfair.

14.CTSAMVM recommends that NAS instructs all its units to cease all offensive
military operations in accordance with the ACOH and the Rome Declaration and
Resolution.

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">CTSAMVM recommends that all Parties involved move forward and implement all
the provisions of the Rome Declaration and Resolution with the continued
mediation of The Community of Sant’Egidio.
