Executive Summary
Between 29 December 2014 and 03 January 2015, there was a significant exchange of fire
between Government Forces in Nassir SPLM/A-IO forces in the area near the eastern side of
UNMISS County Support Base (CSB) and Kebeck Village Area.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">There were also exchanges of
mortar fire over the Sobat River.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">This was preceded by provocations by Government Forces
which consisted of aggressive patrolling near SPLM/A-IO areas and the burning of grass and
tukuls.
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">As a result of investigations, and the weight of evidence collated it is the opinion of the JTC that
whilst the actions of Government Forces led to the incident and constituted violations of the
Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (COHA), subsequent actions by SPLM/A-IO forces went
beyond what could be considered justifiable defensive measures and therefore also constituted
violations of the COHA.

<p><a id="20" name="20">•</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">For some time there has been tension in the Nassir area.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">On  December 2014
there was an exchange of fire between the Government Forces in Nassir and local
armed forces loyal to the SPLM/A-IO in the area of Kedbeck Village.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">This was
reported as a violation of the COHA by Government Forces (V021 dated 13
December 2014).

</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">•</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">Government Forces continued to act in a provocative manner (burning grass and
Tukuls, and patrolling in a confrontational manner).</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">As a result of this provocation
SPLM/A-IO forces regrouped in the area.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">At no time did anyone from authority in
the SPLM/A-IO or the Government complain to the JTC/MVM or indeed to UNMISS
about the situation in Nassir.

<p><a id="28" name="28">•</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">Nassir is designated a Special Arrangement Area as a result of agreements
reached at the Cessation of Hostilities Implementation Workshop of 15-16
November 2014, and as a result should be surrounded by a Separation Zone.

<p><a id="43" name="43">The MVT conducted investigations in accordance with the orders, accessing as
much information as possible from a variety of sources including UNMISS, the
Commanding Officer of the Government Forces and local people in the area of the
incident through the MVT Community Liaison Officer (CLO).</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">The MVT was unable
to get any comment from senior SPLM/A-IO officers.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">The MVT submitted an
Investigation and Verification Report on the evening of 05 January 2015.
2.0  Violations of COHA — NASSIR
26 — 28 December 2014
2.1     Small Government Force patrols of platoon strength had been dominating the area
around Nassir.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">As the rainy season ended and the ground dried they increased the
strength of their patrols and continued to clear the area by burning grass.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">From 26 to
28 there was a lot of burning by Government Forces and some tukuls were destroyed
by fire.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">They also started using APCs and Pick-up trucks for patrolling.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">This was seen
as provocation by the local population, and during the same period the MVT and
UNMISS MLO observed SPLM/A-IO forces regrouping in the Payams adjoining Nassir.
Monday 29 December 2014
2.2     At 1000hrs, Monday, 29 December the Commanding Officer of Government Forces in
Nassir, Brigadier General Peter Yual arrived in the UNMISS Camp for a routine weekly
meeting.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">One of his patrols, which normally spearheads his protection force, had moved
past the UNMISS Camp to ensure the area was safe for the Brigadier.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">There was a lot
of smoke from the burning grass, and as a result of the ongoing provocation by
Government Forces SPLM/A-IO forces were in a defensive posture in the area of
Kedbeck.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">The Government Forces patrol advanced further than usual towards Kedbeck
and clashed with SPLM/A-IO forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">As soon as the firing started, Brigadier General
Yual left the meeting at UNMISS.
</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">•</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">Firing of small arms, machine guns, mortars and RPGs was heard mainly from the
Government Force patrols beyond the UNMISS camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">Government Force
reinforcement troops were observed moving past the UNMISS Camp on foot, 2APCs
and  Pick-up trucks (one mounted with a multi barreled launcher).</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">

</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">•</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">The total number of Government troops that moved in to reinforce were estimated
at over 200.

:</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">   </a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">Shortly thereafter, the MVT immediately interviewed the UNMISS MLOs and troops in
the eastern watch tower (closest to the firing) in order to establish which side initiated
the firing, and got substantial evidence to suggest that SPLM/A-IO fired the first bullet.

2.3     At 1810hrs the Government Forces withdrew to their camp and SPLM/A-IO forces
returned to the Kedbeck area and a heavy exchange of mortar shells and machine gun

<p><a id="65" name="65">According to information received the following day from the MVT Community Liaison
Officer who visited the area two civilians (one woman and one man) were injured in the
fighting, and numerous fires were started as a result of it.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Local people also claimed
that large numbers of SPLM/A-IO youth redeployed to the area in order to defend it
against what they saw as Government Forces aggression.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">The Commanding Officer of
the Government Forces claimed that the firing started when his patrol was shot at by
SPLM/A-IO youths.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">He further claimed that 36 mortar bombs landed in his camp during
the evening shelling, slightly injuring one of his soldiers.</a></p>

2.8     At 1000hrs Saturday  January, the Government Forces moved out of their HQ at on
foot and with two APCs and three pick-up trucks (one mounted with a rocket launcher
and one for ops logs).</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">They started firing immediately on passing the UNMISS Camp.
</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">They concentrated firepower from small arms, machine guns, mortars and RPGs.
•• SPLM/A-IO elements in the Hospital area (about  people) fired and then withdrew
to join a larger group in the area of Kedbeck.
</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">•</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">Government Forces moved closer to Kedbeck while maintaining contact.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">They fell
short of reaching Kedbeck and diverted northwards and set Tukuls on fire in Guange
and Pout- Pout, villages next to Kedbeck.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">They withdrew back to their HQ at 1240
hrs.

<p><a id="92" name="92">•</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">SPLM/A-IO forces resumed patrols immediately in the same area (near the UNMISS
base), and later there was an exchange of mortar shells which the MVT assessed
as being initiated by the SPLM/A-IlO
2.9  Assessment

•</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">There is no doubt that Government Forces acted in a provocative manner in the days
leading up to the incident, especially by burning grass and some tukuls in a move that
was bound to upset the local population and provoke the SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">This provocation,
the confrontational patrol of 29 December and then the attack by Government Forces
on  January constitute clear violations of the COHA.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">Further violations of the COHA
were perpetrated by Government Forces when they engaged areas where civilians were
present (resulting in at least two civilian casualties), and deliberately burnt tukuls.

</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">•</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">However, SPLM/A-IO were also in violation of the COHA.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">It was SPLMA/IO forces who
initiated mortar fire from across the Sobat River on  and  January, and the patrolling
by SPLM/A-IO forces on  January was provocative, as was their pursuit of retreating
Government Forces.

</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">•</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">Atno time did the SPLM/A-IO or Government Forces complain to either the MVM of
UNMISS about the situation, thus allowing for the possibility of settling matters
peaceably.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">

</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">3.0  Conclusion
