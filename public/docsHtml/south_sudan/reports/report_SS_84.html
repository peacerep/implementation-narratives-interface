injury of one Government Forces soldier.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">This incident was investigated by the MVT based at

2.0  Violations of COHA — NASSIR
2.1      At about 10.0  Hrs on  December 2014 the Commanding Officer of the Government
Forces in Nassir (Brigadier Peter Oyual Khor) arrived at the UNMISS camp for a routine meeting
with UNMISS officials and the IGAD MVT.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">Previously at approximately 10.1  </a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">Hrs a 50-60-
strong Government Forces patrol had passed by the UNMISS camp and moved to the east.
</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">This was entirely normal, as Government Forces deployed a security force whenever the
Commanding Officer visited the UNMISS camp for meetings, and they usually took up position
about 300m to the east of the camp by the hospital buildings.
2.0     At about 10.0  Hrs heavy gunfire was heard to the east of the UNMISS camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">This
consisted of small arms fire and explosions from RPG's, and it went on until 12.0  Hrs.
2.0.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">The MVT investigation resulted in the following observations and information:</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">

</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">•</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">The engagement took place to the east of the UNMISS camp, between the camp and
the village of Kedbeck.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">Kedbeck is considered to be in SPLM/A-IO controlled territory.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">

</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">•</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">From the watchtowers at the perimeter of the UNMISS camp MVT and UNMISS
observed Government Forces soldiers about 500m beyond (to the east) of the hospitals.
</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">The Commanding Officer of the UNMISS battalion confirmed that this was well beyond
the usual limit of their routine patrols.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">

</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">•</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">Once the firing had started UNMISS personnel observed approximately 70-80
Government Forces soldiers joining up with those already engaged in the firefight.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">They
also reported seeing about 23 non-uniformed and unidentified armed men exchanging
fire with the Government Forces in the area to the east of the UNMISS camp.

</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">•</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Following the incident the Commanding Officer of the Government Forces claimed that
the patrol to the hospital area was routine, and that it had been seen and engaged by
‘armed youth’.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">He said that the patrol returned fire to defend itself, and that he was
unable to give any estimate of the number of SPLM/A-IO combatants involved as long
grass made it difficult to see the enemy.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">He just said “there were many”.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">One
Government Forces soldier was wounded in the engagement.

</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">•</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">The MVT sent their senior Community Liaison Officer (CLO) to the village of Kedbeck a
few hours after the firing ceased.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">He spoke with some local armed youths and also one
man known to be an SPLM/A-IO soldier called Lok Both.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">These people claimed that the
Government Force patrol moved towards Kedbeck and split into  groups heading for
villages 500-1000m east of the hospitals (and one village reported to be much further
than that).</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">When they were observed approaching the ‘youth’ fetched their weapons
and claimed they were then fired upon by the Government Forces and returned fire in
order to defend themselves.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">It should be noted that many Nuer villagers are armed, and
many SPLM/A-IO are without uniforms which makes it difficult to distinguish whether or
not SPLM/A-I0 “official” forces are involved or not.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">The one man known to be a SPML/A-
 soldier arrived too late to take part in the action.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">One person was injured in the
exchange of fire.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">

<p><a id="64" name="64">IGAD JTC MVM
</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">2.1  Assessment There is no doubt that the Government Forces patrol went much further
than is usual, and that it entered an area considered to be held by the SPLM/A-IO and that
this would be seen as a provocation to both the local people and by any SPLM/A-IO forces
in the area.
</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">3.0  Conclusion
3.1      As a result of investigations, and the weight of evidence collated it is the opinion of the
JTC that Government Forces violated the following articles of the Cessation of Hostilities
Agreement (COHA), 23 January 2014 in Nassir on  December 2014.
- ,2.b Refrain from taking any actions that could lead to military confrontations.
:</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">    </a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">It is recommended that the IGAD Special Envoys take the
appropriate action in response to the violation of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement.
