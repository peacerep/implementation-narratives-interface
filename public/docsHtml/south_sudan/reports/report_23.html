<p><a id="14" name="14">2002/07
SGBV IN CENTRAL EQUATORIA STATE
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
CTSAMVM was made aware of and investigated three cases of SGBV perpetrated by
SSPDF soldiers in the Yei area in November and December 2021.
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">In all three cases the perpetrators were armed, uniformed SSPDF soldiers who
committed these crimes during daytime against women who were engaged in
domestic activities in support of their families.
</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">The perpetrators had unsupervised access to civilian areas with their issued weapons,
and in all three cases the perpetrators used these weapons to threaten their victims.
</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">The SSPDF is to be commended for taking the appropriate action:</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">in two cases the
perpetrators were arrested and are awaiting Courts Martial and in the other case
attempts were made to arrest the suspect but he escaped.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">However, the fact remains
that by allowing unsupervised, ill-disciplined armed soldiers to access civilian areas by
themselves and commit SGBV, the SSPDF failed in its obligation under the R-ARCSS
to protect civilians.

INTRODUCTION
1.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">

</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">a.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">In December 2020, CTSAMVM published a report (2020/09) on SGBV trends,
which suggested that SGBV cases perpetrated by military personnel had
reduced since the signing of the R-ARCSS, and that there was evidence that
the Parties were increasingly accepting responsibility for the actions of their
soldiers and holding those involved accountable for their actions.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">

</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">In July 2020 the SSPDF in Yei convened a Courts Martial to try 26 cases, 17
of which involved rape/SGBV.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">CTSAMVM reported this as a positive step by
the SSPDF in terms of increasing levels of discipline, and demonstrating to
the local population that their soldiers could not act with impunity, and would
be held to account for crimes.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">

</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">c. However, rape/SGBV by military personnel remains a serious issue in
southern Central Equatoria State.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">Since the signing of the R-ARCSS,
CTSAMVM has so far reported  cases of rape/SGBV in the area,  of which
were attributed to the SSPDF (plus another that was attributed jointly to the
SSPDF and SPLM/A-IO).</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">Only one of the cases attributed to the SSPDF
occurred after the July 2020 Courts Martial in Yei.

</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">d.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">Although the situation is improving, between November 2021 and January
2022 CTSAMVM received information about  rape cases involving SSPDF
soldiers in southern Central Equatoria State.

<p><a id="165" name="165">On 22 February 2022, the victim/survivor visited Lasu SSPDF

complete and submit Police Criminal Form 8.

</a></p>
<p><a id="166" name="166">c. On 22 February 2022 CTSAMVM interviewed the SSPDF  Brigade
Intelligence Officer, Maj John Bulo, in Yei.</a></p>
<p><a id="167" name="167">He was fully aware of the case,
and confirmed that the perpetrator, a corporal from the SSPDF Mobile Unit in

<p><a id="173" name="173">ASSESSMENT

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="174" name="174">These rapes were violent acts perpetrated by armed soldiers who used weapons
to threaten and intimidate their victims.

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="175" name="175">The soldiers were all in SSPDF uniform, and the weapons they carried were those
issued to them by the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="176" name="176">In all three cases the rapes took place during the
day and on weekdays, when the soldiers could reasonably be expected to be on
duty.</a></p>
<p><a id="177" name="177">

</a></p>
<p><a id="178" name="178">11.Although the actions taken by the SSPDF to apprehend the perpetrators and bring
them to justice are commendable, it is of great concern that in two cases SSPDF
commanders denied to CTSAMVM they had any knowledge of the rapes.</a></p>
<p><a id="179" name="179">

</a></p>
<p><a id="180" name="180">12.It is the assessment of CTSAMVM that by allowing unsupervised armed soldiers
to access civilian areas by themselves and commit SGBV, the SSPDF failed in its
obligation under the R-ARCSS to protect civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="181" name="181">

</a></p>
<p><a id="182" name="182">CONCLUSIONS

13.CTSAMVM concludes that by failing to protect civilians (especially women and
girls), and by failing to control their soldiers thus allowing them to commit rape, the
SSPDF has acted in violation of articles (2)(g),  (2)(a), (3) and (b) of the ACOH
of 21 December 2017, and articles 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0.1  and 2.0.10.0.5  of
the R-ARCSS of 12 September 2018.</a></p>

<p><a id="184" name="184">OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

14.CTSAMVM commends the actions taken by the SSPDF to hold the perpetrators of
these criminal acts to account.</a></p>
<p><a id="185" name="185">However, the fact that these men were allowed out
of their barracks by themselves with their issued weapons suggests a lack of
control and discipline.

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="186" name="186">There have been delays in criminal proceedings by the Police in Yei caused by the
failure of the victim/survivors to return ‘Police Criminal Form ’, which has to be
signed by a doctor.</a></p>
<p><a id="187" name="187">This suggests that the police do not explain the process of
opening up investigations into an alleged rape, and thus the importance of the form,
or follow up on cases reported to them when the form is not then submitted.

16.None of the SSPDF officers interviewed by CTSAMVM during the initial
investigation said anything about having provided help or support to the
victim/survivors in any way.</a></p>
<p><a id="188" name="188">However, on  March 2022 CTSAMVM engaged with
the Commander and Intelligence Officer of SSPDF  Brigade in Yei who informed
them that the SSPDF does have a compensation scheme, and, once the Courts
Martials are over, compensation will be paid to the victim/survivors of those soldiers
found guilty.</a></p>
<p><a id="189" name="189">CTSAMVM was told that following the Courts Martial in Yei in July
2020, the SSPDF disbursed over SSP  million in compensation.</a></p>
<p><a id="190" name="190">The Brigade
Commander said the date for the Courts Martial was to be confirmed, and that
there are a total of 21 cases to be tried, including  of rape.

17.The immediate commanding officers of two of the perpetrators denied to
CTSAMVM they had any knowledge of the incidents.</a></p>
<p><a id="191" name="191">In one case — incident  —
the commander of the perpetrator’s unit failed to report the case to his superiors.
 </a></p>
<p><a id="192" name="192">Brigade SSPDF only found out about the case several weeks later from the civil
authorities.</a></p>
<p><a id="193" name="193">

18.</a></p>
<p><a id="194" name="194">In all three cases the victim/survivors were attacked during the day as they carried
out gender-specific daily routines:</a></p>
<p><a id="195" name="195">fetching food, thatching and water for their
families.</a></p>
<p><a id="196" name="196">They should be able to carry out these domestic tasks free from the
presence and threat of armed, uniformed men.

19.</a></p>
<p><a id="197" name="197">It is recommended that:</a></p>
<p><a id="198" name="198">

</a></p>
<p><a id="199" name="199">a. The SSPDF takes measures to improve discipline.</a></p>
<p><a id="200" name="200">Armed soldiers should
not be allowed out of barracks unless under command of a responsible officer
or NCO and clearly on duty.</a></p>
<p><a id="201" name="201">

</a></p>
<p><a id="202" name="202">b. The SSPDF takes the appropriate disciplinary measures against officers who
fail to report or take action against soldiers who commit crimes against
civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="203" name="203">

</a></p>
<p><a id="204" name="204">c. The SSPDF continues in its efforts to apprehend and bring to justice the
perpetrator who escaped (Incident 1).

</a></p>
<p><a id="205" name="205">d. The Police in Yei do more to help those reporting rape cases.</a></p>
<p><a id="206" name="206">There should
be follow-up by police when ‘Form ’ is issued, to ensure the form is returned
in a timely manner.</a></p>
<p><a id="207" name="207">It must be remembered that victim/survivors will be
confused and traumatised, and many will be illiterate.
