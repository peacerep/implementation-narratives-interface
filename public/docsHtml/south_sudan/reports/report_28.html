CTSAMM REPORT NUMBER 055
INITIAL REPORT</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">ON FIGHTING IN WAAT, JONGLEI STATE
Executive Summary
Fighting broke out in WAAT in mid-August between the SPLA and the SPLA-IO (RM).
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">Since then there has been sporadic conflict with further outbreaks of fighting starting in
early October with casualties reported on both sides.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">The airstrip is some distance from
the town and the proximity of opposition apparently prevented the evacuation of
government casualties.
</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">Due to the situation on the ground CTSAMM has so far been unable to deploy an MVT
to WAAT to investigate and report on the cause and course of the conflict there.
</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">However, CTSAMM has been able to access sufficient information from local and open
sources to be able to confirm that fighting has taken place, and that this constitutes a
serious violation of the PCTSA.
</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">CTSAMM hopes to be able to visit WAAT once the situation stabilises and then submit
a full report attributing responsibility for violations of the PCTSA.
FIGHTING IN WAAT, JONGLEI STATE

1.0_</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">Introduction

1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">

</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">•</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">There have been reports of fighting around WAAT since the middle of August.
</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">WAAT is the capital of what is known as Biech State;</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">some county
commissioners from Biech state are based either in Juba or in WAAT
because much of the state is under the control of SPLA-IO (RM).

</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">•</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The appointed Governor of what is known as Akobo State was also in WAAT
at the time.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">This was because AKOBO remains under the control of the
SPLA-IO (RM) and he has been unable to deploy there.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">Sources suggest
that opposition elements do not agree with the creation of what is known as
Akobo State, and that this is the cause of the conflict.

.•</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">Government and SPLA-IO (RM) spokesmen have provided conflicting
accounts of the conflict.

1.2.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">The purpose of this initial report is to outline what information CTSAMM has
been able to collect about the recent fighting in the WAAT, and to make
recommendations for future action.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">

</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">1.3  Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">

</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">•</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">The situation in WAAT has meant that CTSAMM has been unable to visit and
undertake an assessment of the cause and course of the ongoing conflict in
the area.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">However, the AYOD MVT was able to contact a range of local
sources and also speak with Juba-based officials, particularly the Governor
of what is known as Biech State.

</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">•</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">Open sources have also been used to provide information for this initial
report.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">

2.0.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">Findings

2.1  Fighting started in the WAAT area on 13 August 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">Government Sources
claimed that WAAT was attacked by SPLA-IO (RM) forces who were repulsed
with losses of  or  killed on both sides.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">Local sources indicated that the attack
was directed at the appointed Governor of what is called Akobo State who was
resident in WAAT at the time.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">

2.2  Reports of sporadic fighting in the WAAT area continued during September.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">

</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">2.3  On  October 2017 reports were received of more serious fighting in the WAAT
area with significant casualties on both sides — unconfirmed reports suggested
at least  SPLA soldiers were killed and 20-30 wounded, and 80 “White Army”
fighters killed and many more wounded.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">Government officials claimed this was
another attack by the SPLA-IO (RM), and some sources suggested that the

“ SPLA had deployed heavy artillery during the engagement which resulted in
civilian casualties.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">The fighting has continued.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">

2.4  </a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">It has also been reported that the SPLA has been unable to evacuate casualties
as the airstrip is some distance from their positions and close to SPLA-IO (RM)
forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">On  October 2017 the SPLA-IO (RM) spokesman claimed in a press
statement that the SPLA had used artillery and aircraft in attacks against SPLM-
 (RM) positions in and around WAAT.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">In the statement he also claimed that
the SPLM-IO (RM) controlled “90%” of WAAT.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">There were further reports of
fighting on 15 October suggesting  SPLA soldiers were killed.

</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">
</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">3.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Fighting has taken place in and around WAAT over the past two months.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">Some
~ of the fighting has been serious with casualties on both sides.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">This much is clear
from statements from both Parties, and corroborated reports from a variety of
sources.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">

3.2.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">CTSAMM has so far not been able to visit WAAT, although  attempts have been
made to so but were prevented by UNMISS being unable to get Flight Safety
Assurances.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">CTSAMM is therefore unable to present a first-hand account of the
situation or make any sort of assessment about which Party is responsible for
the fighting.

3.3  </a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">However, any sort of deliberate fighting represents a clear violation of the
PCTSA, and whichever of the Parties is responsible for the conflict in the WAAT
area is responsible for a significant breach of the ceasefire at a time when efforts
are being made to revitalise the peace process.

4.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">

</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">5.0.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">CTSAMM will continue to try and visit WAAT in order to investigate and report on
the conflict in the area as soon as the security situation allows.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">

</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">5.1  It is recommended that representation be made at the political level for the forces
of both sides to separate in order that further conflict can be avoided.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">The
causes of the conflict can be addressed as the revitalisation process moves
forward.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">

</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">5.2  Government members of CTSAMM claim that WAAT was attacked by SPLA-IO
(RM) forces, and that the SPLA has been on the defensive throughout the
