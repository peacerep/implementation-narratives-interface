CTSAMM REPORT NUMBER 2018/06
REPORT ON ALLEGED FIGHTING IN LEER and RUBKUAY
Executive Summary
An allegation was made by the Government authorities in LEER that on 27 December
2017 SPLA-IO (RM) forces from THONYOR attacked LEER.  </a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">They also claimed that on
29 December SPLA-IO (RM) forces attacked and took RUBKUAY, capturing the Deputy
County Commissioner.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">They emphasised that these incidents took place after the
signing of the ACOH.
</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">CTSAMM established that whilst SPLA-IO (RM) forces attacked LEER and took
RUBKUAY, this was during fighting which took place in November 2017, and that there
have been no significant military advances or attacks since the ACOH was signed.
</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">However, SPLA-IO (RM) forces remain in violation of the ACOH because they have
failed to release the Deputy County Commissioner, and also because they maintain
roadblocks in place throughout the area of what is known as Southern Liech State.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">There has been a long history of fighting between the Parties in what is known as
Southern Liech State throughout the current conflict with attacks by both sides on the
other's positions.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">Further conflict must stop.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">The ACOH must be implemented.
</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">Both Parties are failing to comply with the ACOH by not disengaging forces in close
proximity, and CTSAMM is concerned that the drivers for conflict still exist what is known
as Southern Liech State.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">This needs to be addresses at both the political and local level
as a matter of urgency if further fighting is to be avoided.

<p><a id="18" name="18">ALLEGED FIGHTING IN LEER and RUBKUAY

1.0  Introduction

1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">LEER is the headquarters of what is known as Southern Liech State.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">It has
been held by the Government throughout the current conflict, although it has
been the focus of much fighting.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">SPLA forces in LEER and those of the SPLA-IO (RM) whose headquarters
are in THONYOR are in close proximity.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">There was heavy fighting around LEER in November 2017.  </a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">Early in the
month the SPLA-IO (RM) imposed a blockade on the town which led to
significant tension and an attack by Government Forces on the SPLA-IO (RM)
roadblock.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">Attacks on LEER by SPLA-IO (RM) forces followed on 22 and 30 November.
</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">The first attacks led to the evacuation of the town by all international NGOs.
</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The fighting led to a significant number of casualties, particularly amongst
SPLA-IO (RM) forces, and was the subject of an investigation by CTSAMM
in December 2017.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">Prior to the fighting in LEER the SPLA-IO (RM) took RUBKUAY town.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">This
happened on 20 November 2017 after a warning to humanitarian actors in
the area the previous day.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">RUBKUAY had been held by SPLA-IO (TD)
forces.

1.2  Incidents:</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">The incidents which are the focus of this report concern alleged
attacks by SPLA-IO (RM) forces against LEER on 27 December 2017 and
against RUBKUAY on 29 December 2017 after the start date of the ACOH.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">The
allegations were made by Government Authorities in LEER.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">The Government

Authorities also claimed that during the attack at RUBKUAY they captured the
Deputy County Commissioner.

1.3  Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The purpose of this report is to summarise the findings of the CTSAMM
investigation into the allegations, apportion responsibility where possible and
make recommendations.

1.4.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">
•</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">On 9Q January 2018 an MVT deployed from Juba to LEER, visiting KOCH on

the way.

</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">•</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">On 11 January the MVT spoke with a wide range of people in LEER including
civil and military authorities and on 12 January they visited the SPLA-IO (RM)
HQ in THONYOR and subsequently spoke with the SPLA-IO  (RM)
Commissioner in RUBKUAY.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">The MVT also interviewed to a number of witnesses and liaised with the
UNMISS unit based in LEER.

2.0  Findings

2.1  There was no attack by the SPLA-IO (RM) against LEER on 27 December.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">The
authorities eventually admitted that this was the case.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">There have been no
significant operations by the SLA-IO (RM) against LEER since 30 November
2017.

2.2|</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">The SPLA-IO (RM) did take RUBKUAY, but this was on 20 November, not 29
December 2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">The SPLA-IO (RM) still hold the Deputy County Commissioner
who (so far as the MVT could ascertain) is in custody in RUBKUAY.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">The SPLA-
 (RM) Commissioner told the MVT he was ‘in hospital’ in RUBKUAY.

2.3  The situation in the area remains tense.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">The Government Authorities in LEER
Stated that they would mount offensive operations to re-take RUBKUAY unless

CTSAMM and other actors forced the SPLA-IO (RM) to vacate it.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">The SPLA-IO
(RM) are adamant that they hold all of what is known as Southern Liech State
apart from LEER itself, and that they will react with force if the SPLA or SPLA-IO
(TD) try to take RUBKUAY or any other area.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">The Government Authorities
asserted that SPLA-IO (RM) claims about how much territory they hold in what
is known as Southern Liech State are exaggerated.

2.4  There has been no significant military movement since the signing of the ACOH,
and no territory has changed hands since the November fighting and capture of
RUBKUAY.

2.5  SPLA-IO (RM) maintain roadblocks and checkpoints throughout the area which
hinder the free movement of people and goods.

2.6  The SPLA-IO (RM) accused Government Forces from LEER of  attacking
PULJATH on 29 December, killing two people and raping two women, but the
MVT has yet to find any witnesses to this.

3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">

3.1  The SPLA-IO (RM) took RUBKUAY on 20 November.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">This was a clear violation
under the PCTSA, but it happened before the  signing of the ACOH on 21
December when all Parties were to freeze in place.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">It appears probable that the
Government authorities claimed the attack happened after the ACOH to indicate
they still have a claim on it.

3.2.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">The SPLA-IO (RM) have kept the captured Government Deputy Commissioner
since they took RUBKUAY.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">He has not been released following the signing of
the ACOH.

3.3  Both Parties are claiming as much territory as they can.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">This is probably a move
designed to give them as much leverage as possible in future discussions.

3.4  The claim by Government Authorities that LEER had been attacked on 27
December were easily disproved by the MVT.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">The authorities subsequently
withdrew the claim.

3.5  The situation in what is known in Southern Liech State remains tense.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">There
could easily be further conflict unless measures are taken to stop it.

3.6  Conclusions:</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">By attacking RUBKUAY on 20 November and LEER on 22 and 30 November
2017 the SPLA-IO were in clear violation of the PCTSA whatever provocation
they had been subjected to by the Government.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">However, the SPLA-IO (RM) have taken no military action in violation of the
ACOH since it has been signed.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">By failing to release the captured Deputy Commissioner in RUBKUAY, the
SPLA-IO (RM) remain in violation of the ACOH Article Nine, paragraph 2.a.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">By failing to disengage forces in close proximity both Parties are in violation
of Article One paragraph  of the ACOH.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">By maintaining road blocks and checkpoints, SPLA-IO (RM) forces are in
violation of Article Three, Paragraph  and Article Eight, Paragraph  of the
ACOH.

4.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">

4.1  The area around LEER has been a trouble spot throughout the current conflict,
with numerous instances provocation, attack and counter attack.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">In the past the
SPLA failed to clear SPLA-IO (RM) from ADOK and other towns they control,
and SPLA-IO (RM) forces failed to take LEER.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">The drivers for conflict have yet
to be resolved, and CTSAMM recommends that action be taken at the political

level to ensure that both Parties maintain their forces in place and take no
provocative action.

4.2  CTSAMM further recommends that as a matter of urgency JMCC or a Joint
Commission appointed from representatives of both Parties at the local level
facilitates the disengagement of all forces in close contact in the area, and their
withdrawal back to base locations, leaving only civil authorities in contested
areas.

4.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">CTSAMM calls on the SPLA-IO (RM) to release the (Government) Deputy
County Commissioner in RUBKUAY immediately and allow him to return to his
family.
