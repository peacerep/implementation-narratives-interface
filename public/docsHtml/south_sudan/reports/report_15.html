TROOP MOVEMENT FROM NORTHERN BAHR EL GHAZAL STATE TO UPPER
NILE STATE

Introduction

1.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">Allegation:</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">

</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">a.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">On 21 November 2020 CTSAMVM received an allegation from Maj Gen
Goanar, the commander of SPLM/A-IO Division , that on 19 and 20 November
2020 the SSPDF moved approximately 100 heavily armed soldiers from '•</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">
</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">Division in Northern Bahr el Ghazal State to Paloich in Upper Nile State.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">

</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">b. CTSAMVM had received no notification of this alleged movement from the
SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">

2.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The aim of this report is to detail the findings of CTSAMVM investigations into
this allegation, attribute responsibility for breaches of the R-ARCSS where
applicable and to make recommendations.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">

</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">a.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">On 24 November 2020 CTSAMVM visited  Division SSPDF at Wunyik.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">The
Divisional Commander was away, but they met the Deputy Divisional
Commander Maj Gen James Akoch.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">

</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">On  December 2020 CTSAMVM visited % Division SSPDF HQ again and
this time were able to meet the Divisional Commander, Maj Gen Bak Akook
Bak, together with his senior staff officers.

</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">Findings

4.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">During the visit to  Division SSPDF on 24 November 2020 the Deputy Divisional
Commander stated that:</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">

</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">a.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">The troop movement consisted of 80 soldiers, not 100.

</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">It was the result of a bi-lateral agreement between Sudan and South Sudan
aimed at strengthening common border security.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">

</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">c.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">The order for the movement came from the “strategic level”.

</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">d. The Deputy Commander observed that flanking units had not been informed
of the movement, and that this was an oversight by the higher level of
command.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">He also said that they (3% Division) assumed CTSAMVM would
have been informed by higher command.

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">During the visit to % Division SSPDF, the Divisional Commander confirmed what
had been said by the Deputy Commander.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">He went on to state that:</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">

</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">a. The SSPDF did not intentionally breach the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">

</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">In future he would ensure that CTSAMVM was informed of all movements as
required by the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">

6.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">Movement from Bentiu:</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">On 30 November 2020 CTSAMVM was made aware of
another movement of a similar number of SSPDF troops by air from " Division in
Bentiu.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">The CTSAMVM SSPDF Senior National Liaison Officer confirmed that this
was part of the same plan to manage the Sudanese border which involved troops
contributions from %, ' and " Divisions.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">CTSAMVM was not informed of this
movement.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">

</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Assessment

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">There is nothing to suggest that this troop movement constituted a deliberate
violation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">However, by failing to inform CTSAMVM on the
movement, the SSPDF was in clear breach of the R-ARCSS.

</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Conclusion

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM by moving troops from Wunyiik to Paloich on 20
and 21 November 2020 and from other areas as part of the same deployment, the
SSPDF failed to comply with the R-ARCSS specifically Article 2.1.10.0:</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">(prohibited
actions)</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">“......redeployment and movement of forces , except for administrative and
logistical movements allowed under COHA of 21 December 2017, which will be
reported to CTSAMVM prior to movements......”

Observations and Recommendations

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">There is no evidence to suggest that this troop movement was anything to do with
the conflict between the Parties to the R-ARCSS:</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">according to senior SSPDF
officers it was a strategic movement to help manage border security with Sudan.
</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">However, this movement was made without informing CTSAMVM.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">It was also
made without informing ‘flanking formations’ including those of the SPLM/A-IO.

10.Whether the failure to inform both CTSAMVM and the SPLM/A-IO was the
responsibility of JDB or the SSPDF is not clear, however this failure could have led
to serious misunderstandings.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">CTSAMVM recommends:</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">
</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">a. That JDB reminds all commanders of their responsibility under the R-ARCSS

to inform CTSAMVM of administrative and logistic troop movements.
</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">That all JDB ensures all Parties and relevant formations are informed of any
such movements
