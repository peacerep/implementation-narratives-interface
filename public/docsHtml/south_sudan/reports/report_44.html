<p><a id="43" name="43">1.0  Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">
</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">•</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">The MVT based in Aweil deployed to Wau to investigate the allegations.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">On
40 February they visited Momoi (which was deserted) and then Busseri
together with UNMISS Force Protection and MLOs, but Government Forces
soldiers did not allow them to talk to the local population.

<p><a id="48" name="48">•</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">Following discussions with the Acting Governor and the Chief of Operations
at the Government Forces " Division HQ, the MVT was able to return to
Busseri on 12 February and conduct interviews with local people.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">The MVT

2.0     VIOLATIONS OF THE PCTSA DIRECTED AT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION
</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">2.1  Displacement of the people of Moimoi:</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">There are no people in Momoi at all.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">The MVT observed that many of the
houses had been burnt down.

</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">•</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Government Forces were present in the village commanded by a Lieutenant
who said that the young men had gone “into the bush” and the women and
children to Wau.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">The officer also claimed there had been several attacks by unknown armed
groups operating in the area, the last being on  February when one SPLA
soldier and one member of the armed group were killed a few Kilometres
north of Momdi.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">The Government Forces officer also said that the armed group were not
members of the SPLM/A-IO but local people.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">They wore a variety of police
and wildlife uniforms and civilian clothes.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">

2.2  Information from Busseri:</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">The MVT were able to interview a variety of local
people in Busseri, which they noted was sparsely populated and devoid of young
men;</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">the MVT saw only old men, women and children.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">There were reportedly
only 200 people left out of a population of 1450.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">The road was closed.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">The
information the MVT gained is summarised as follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">

</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">•</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">The recent problems in the area started in October 2015 when Dinka cattle-
keepers came into the area in the dry season.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">Crops were destroyed and
the local people apparently moved to protect them, and clashes developed
between the locals and the cattle-keepers.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">The cattle-keepers were reported
as being armed and aggressive.

</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">—————
•</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">Government Forces are seen by the local people as the protectors of the
cattle-keepers and therefore against the locals.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">People are afraid of them
and have fled.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">There is also a feeling that, following clashes between
Government Forces and armed groups in the Bazia area (south of Busseri),
the Government regards the locals as ‘rebels’ and treats them accordingly.

</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">•</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">Killing and looting:</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">The MVT received reports of the killing of civilians by
Government Forces, specifically an old woman and a deputy sultan of the
area.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">The local people also reported that Government Forces had burnt
some houses and looted property.

</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">•</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">{twas clear to the MVT that the settlements along the road were firmly under
the control of Government Forces.

</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">

3.1  The situation south of Wau is  complex.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">There are tensions  between the
Government and local people that predate the current conflict;</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">and that have
been exacerbated by the current conflict and also by the presence of cattle-
keepers who appear to be wandering further than usual from Warrap and Lakes
states.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">

32</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">There are armed groups operating in the area, and there are credible reports
suggesting that  Government Forces have been  subject to attacks  and
provocation.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">The MVT found no evidence to suggest that these armed groups
were affiliated to or under the orders of the SPLM/A-IO.

3.2  </a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">According to the Government authorities the SPLA are deployed in the area to
protect the local people from the cattle-keepers.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">However, the locals were all
living in fear of Government Forces;</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">indeed, they appeared to be more scared of
Government Forces than of the cattle-keepers.

3.3  The MVT witnessed that houses have been burnt in Momoi and that the civilian
population had fled.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">They also witnessed that Busseri— the next village down the
road from Momoi - was nearly deserted and the remaining people were living in
fear of Government Forces and many gave witness to violent acts committed by
such forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">All the evidence obtained by the MVT in the area indicate beyond
any reasonable doubt that in exercising control over the area Government Forces

have failed in their duty under the PCTSA to protect civilians.

</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">4.0  Conclusion

4.1  Itis the opinion of the JTC that Government Forces have violated Article 1.0  of
the PCTSA in the Moimoi area, particularly:</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">

</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">•</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">Article 1.1.5:</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">Acts of hostility, intimidation, violence or attacks against the
civilian population...

4.0  </a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">Additionally, the JTC finds that Government Forces have violated 3.0  of the
Cessation of Hostilities Agreement of 23 January 2014 (COH), BOTH through its
attacks AND by failing to protect “human rights, life and property.”</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">

*</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">The PCTSA is based upon the COH of 23 January 2014 and, therefore, the
COH is incorporated in full in the PCTSA.</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">(PCTSA, Articles 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2)

•</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">Pursuant to the COH, the Warring Parties have an affirmative obligation to
“commit to the protection of human rights, life and property as provided by
various national, continental and   international instruments;)" Such
instruments include, of course, Geneva Protocol || (1977) and the Geneva
Convention Act, 2012 signed into South Sudanese law by President Salva
Kiir Mayardit on  June 2012.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">

5.0  Recommendations and observations:</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">

5.1  The issues in the area south of Wau predate the current conflict.  </a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">CTSAMM is
unable to confirm whether or not the local armed groups operating in the area
are under the orders of the SPLM/A -IO, but all indications suggest this is a local
problem that does not involve SPLM/A-IO forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">However, the articles of the
PCTSA still apply and, by failing to protect the civilian population and by using
excessive measures such as the burning of buildings and displacement of
populations, Government Forces are in violation of the PCTSA.</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">

</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">5.2  </a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">It is recommended that JMEC encourages all parties involved to resolve the
issues affecting the area in order that there is no further escalation, and that
people can return to their homes in peace.</a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">

</a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">5.3  </a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">It is recommended that the Warring Parties be reminded that they have an
Affirmative Obligation to develop policies, programmes, and procedures that
protect human rights, life and property.</a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">That is, in addition to ensuring their
Forces refrain from attacking civilians and their property, such Forces are
required to develop and to practice proactive measures to protect them.</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">

</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">i cena
5.4  Observation by Government members of CTSAMM:</a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">Government members of
CTSAMM wanted to emphasise that their forces in the area the incident took
place have been subject to significant provocations, including attacks and
ambushes.
