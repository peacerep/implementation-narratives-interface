Executive Summary 

</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">This report on the status of implementation of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution 
of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) has been prepared pursuant to article 
7.9 of Chapter VII of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">The report covers the period from 1 October to 31 December 
2021  and  builds  on  the  previous  quarterly  Report  No.  012/21.  </a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">It  provides  a  status  update  on 
progress or lack thereof in the implementation of the tasks of the R-ARCSS during the reporting 
period, highlight challenges facing the implementation, provide observations and concludes with 
recommendations for remedial measures.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">

</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">During  the  period  under  review,  the  report  observes  that  there  was  some  progress  made 
towards implementation of the R-ARCSS, however, overall, implementation remains slow almost 
two  years  after  the  formation  of  the  Revitalised  Transitional  Government  of  National  Unity 
(RTGoNU).</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">Notable among the achievements during the reporting period is the reconstitution and 
appointments  of  members  of  nine  out  of  ten  State  Legislative  Assemblies,  nominations  to  the 
Judicial Reforms Committee, maintaining of the permanent ceasefire, deployment of assessment 
teams to the training centres, stepped up efforts to address Sexual  and Gender Based Violence 
(SGBV),  and  the  tabling  of  the  Permanent  Constitution-making  Bill  before  the  Transitional 
National Legislative Assembly (TNLA).</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">

</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">Implementation remains slow, particularly  in  the critical  areas of the Transitional Security 
Arrangements (TSA), enactment of key pending Bills before the TNLA, and the setting up of the 
Transitional Justice mechanisms.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">In an effort to highlight the impediments to implementation of 
the R-ARCSS, and to seek renewed efforts on the part of the RTGoNU that is charged with its 
implementation,  the  RJMEC  leadership  regularly  engaged  the  Presidency  and  key  government 
ministers as well as various stakeholders to the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">

</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">Importantly, the Permanent Ceasefire continued to hold among Signatory Parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">However, 
intermittent clashes were reported between SPLA-IO forces loyal to H.E. Dr. Riek Machar Teny, 
First  Vice  President  of  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan,  and  forces  loyal  to  the  former  Chief  of 
Defence Staff of the SPLA-IO, Lt Gen Simon Gatwech Dual in the area around Magenis on the 
border with Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">Additionally, there were lethal intercommunal clashes in Tambura, Western 
Equatoria  State,  and  Warrap  State.  </a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">Intercommunal  violence  was  also  reported  in  Jonglei  and 
Eastern Equatoria States.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">There were also reported clashes between the National Salvation Front 
(NAS), and the Signatory Parties  – SSPDF and SPLA-IO in Central Equatoria and the Mundri 
area, as well as occasional alleged attacks by NAS on civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">

</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">The unification of the Necessary Unified Forces (NUF) continued to stagnate throughout the 
reporting period.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Troops that were trained during the Phase I unification process failed to graduate 
and redeploy as required by the Agreement due to the lack of funding and resources, as well as a 
lack of political will by the RTGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">The impasse in reaching an agreement on both the force 
unification ratios and the unified command negotiations between the ITGoNU and the Opposition 
leadership, has significantly delayed the graduation and redeployment of the NUF.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">The  magnitude  and  severity  of  humanitarian  needs  continued  to  rise  during  the  reporting 
period,  due  to  cumulative  effects  of  prolonged  inter  communal  and  community  based  conflict, 
widespread flooding, high levels of food insecurity and the covid-19 pandemic.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">According to the 
United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), by December, 
more than 835,000 people in 33 of 78 counties were affected by flooding across the country and 
faced high levels of food insecurity and poor access to basic services.  

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">iv

Introduction 

1.       </a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">This  report  on  the  status  of  implementation  of  the  Revitalised  Agreement  on  the 
Resolution  of  the  Conflict  in  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan  (R-ARCSS)  has  been  prepared 
pursuant  to  article 7.9 of Chapter VII of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">The report covers the period from  1 
October  to  31  December  2021  and  builds  on  the  previous  quarterly  Report  No.  012/21.1  </a></p>

some observations and concludes with recommendations to key stakeholders. 
2.       </a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">The report draws  from various sources of information and reports periodically received 
from  Agreement  institutions  and  mechanisms  pursuant  to  article  7.8  of  the  R-ARCSS, 
participatory peer-reviews of the status  of implementation of the thematic chapters of the R-
ARCSS through monthly meetings of the six  Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation 
Commission (RJMEC) Working Committees, RJMEC monthly plenary meetings and regular 
consultative meetings the RJMEC leadership convenes with the Parties to the R-ARCSS, other 
South Sudanese stakeholders and adherents, regional guarantors and International Partners and 
Friends of South Sudan.  
3.      </a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">The report observes that there was some progress made towards implementation of the R-
ARCSS, however, overall, implementation remains slow almost two years after the formation

5.  </a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">The Leadership also reached out decidedly to the Heads of States of the IGAD countries to 
brief  them  on  the  unfolding  situation  within  South  Sudan  and  also  to  seek  their  guidance  in 
helping to increase the pace of implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">All along the leadership also provided updates

<p><a id="142" name="142">Status of Implementation of the Transitional Tasks of the R-ARCSS 

Chapter 1:</a></p>
<p><a id="143" name="143">Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity 

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="144" name="144">     </a></p>
<p><a id="145" name="145">The update builds on the last quarter report, detailing tasks, which have been accomplished 
during the reporting period, implementation which are ongoing and tasks where implementation 
remains outstanding.</a></p>
<p><a id="146" name="146">As 2021 came to a close, the South Sudan's RTGoNU was nearing two 
years  old,  with  just  14  months  remaining  to  achieve  the  goals  set  out  in  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="147" name="147">The 
government structure was established at the national and subnational levels, some progress was 
made towards implementing provisions of chapter I of the R-ARCSS, however, several critical 
tasks are yet to be implemented. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="148" name="148">8.  </a></p>
<p><a id="149" name="149">Notably, progress was registered during the quarter in the reconstitution and appointments of 
members of nine out of ten State Legislative Assemblies (SLA).</a></p>
<p><a id="150" name="150">Whereas this development is 
welcome, at the time of compiling this report, the SLA for Western Bahr el Ghazal was yet to 
be reconstituted and none of the appointed members in the other nine states were sworn in.</a></p>
<p><a id="151" name="151">The 
delays in the swearing in of the SLA implied that they were unable to embark on their legislative 
and oversight functions as required by the R-ARCSS and the Transitional Constitution of the 
Republic of South Sudan (TCRSS) 2011, as amended.</a></p>
<p><a id="152" name="152">It is therefore critical that all the State 
Assemblies and Councils are reconstituted and operationalized so as to enable them to perform 
the required legislative and oversight functions at the subnational level. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="153" name="153">9.  </a></p>
<p><a id="154" name="154">The  RTGoNU  in  collaboration  with  the  United  Nations  Development  Program  (UNDP) 
convened the 5th Governance Forum for the Governors and Chief Administrators of the 10 States 
and the three Administrative Areas respectively from 22-29 November 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="155" name="155">The Forum, which 
was  held  in  Juba,  was  chaired  by  H.E.  Dr.  Riek  Machar  Teny,  First  Vice  President  of  the 
Republic  of  South  Sudan.  </a></p>
<p><a id="156" name="156">In  attendance  were  other  members  of  the  Presidency,  national 
ministers, undersecretaries, Governor of the Bank of South Sudan,  the diplomatic corps, and

<p><a id="212" name="212">The RJMEC Leadership also travelled 
to Tambura with UNMISS.</a></p>
<p><a id="213" name="213">Subsequent to their consultations, the JDB ordered the relocation of 
the  SPLA-IO  forces  and  those  loyal  to  General  James  Nando,  from  the  Tambura  area  to  the 
Maridi  Training  Center,  as  these  forces  were  implicated  in  the  violence.  </a></p>
<p><a id="214" name="214">Concurrently,  the

</a></p>
<p><a id="215" name="215">The relocation of the SPLA-IO and Gen Nando’s forces took several weeks, but eventually all 
forces were relocated to Maridi apart from  some of Gen Angelo Davido’s youth militias.</a></p>
<p><a id="216" name="216">The

23.  </a></p>
<p><a id="217" name="217">Between  October  and  December  2021,  CTSAMVM  reported  twenty  NAS  related 
incidents including clashes with the SSPDF and the SPLA-IO, road ambushes on the Signatory 
forces as well as civilian vehicles, abduction of civilians, looting and destructions of property, 
and armed robberies.</a></p>
<p><a id="218" name="218">Most of the incidents were concentrated in the southern part of Central

Equatoria, with a few in East and West Mundri Counties, and also in Maridi County.</a></p>
<p><a id="219" name="219">Although

24.  </a></p>
<p><a id="222" name="222">During the reporting period, CTSAMVM reported two SGBV incidents of which one was 
committed by a member of SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="223" name="223">On 28 September 2021, CTSAMVM was informed by 
the State Minister of Local Government and Law Enforcement of Jonglei State that there is a 
criminal group of young men operating in the State who among other crimes, regularly commit 
SGBV incidents.</a></p>
<p><a id="224" name="224">However, the report did not indicate if the perpetrators were held accountable 
and victims provided with assistance (medical, psychological and reparation.  
25.  </a></p>
<p><a id="225" name="225">On 19 October 2021, CTSAMVM submitted to the RJMEC Interim Chairperson a report 
on SGBV committed in Western Equatoria State.</a></p>
<p><a id="226" name="226">The incident involved an SPLM/A-IO soldier 
from Lirangu camp, Division 9B,  who raped a 45-year-old woman in Yabongo Boma, Nzara 
County on 8 September 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="227" name="227">The soldier also stole a cellular phone and SSP 4 800 from the 
home of the victim.</a></p>
<p><a id="228" name="228">On the same day, the soldier was found guilty and was publicly flogged and 
fined  SSP  50  000.  </a></p>
<p><a id="229" name="229">The  stolen  items  were  recovered  but  there  was  no  compensation  for  the 
victim.</a></p>
<p><a id="230" name="230">After four days in custody, the perpetrator was reported to have  escaped.</a></p>
<p><a id="231" name="231">There were 
reports that he joined Gen James Nando’s forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="232" name="232">After investigation, CTSAMVM concluded 
that the SPLM/A-IO failed to exercise command and control by properly training soldiers 
to refrain from misconduct such as SGBV and theft of civilian property.  
26.  </a></p>
<p><a id="233" name="233">CTSAMVM recommended among other measures that:</a></p>
<p><a id="234" name="234">(i) SPLM/A-IO redouble its 
efforts to train  its soldiers on the  requirements  of the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities, 
Protection of Civilians and Humanitarian Access (CoHA) and R-ARCSS agreements, and on 
the prohibitions against rape and sexual abuse and the requirement to respect the person and 
dignity of women.</a></p>
<p><a id="235" name="235">RJMEC recommended to the JDB that the SPLA-IO soldier who committed 
the rape and later escaped from custody, should be rearrested and face justice in order to deter 
others from committing similar offences. 
27.  </a></p>
<p><a id="236" name="236">The  JDB,  in  collaboration  with  the  Minister  of  Defence  and  the  Minister  of  Health, 
launched  their  action  plan  for  addressing  ‘Conflict-related  Sexual  Violence’  (CRSV)  on  30 
November 2021.  </a></p>
<p><a id="237" name="237">Participation included national ministries, NGOs including South Sudanese 
women  and  youth  organisations,  UNMISS,  UNDP,  UNICEF  and  RJMEC,  as  well  as  the 
international diplomatic community.  </a></p>
<p><a id="238" name="238">Allegations of SGBV by Parties to the Agreement have 
been reported and evidenced by both CTSAMVM and UNMISS and a number of cases have 
been investigated and dealt with by both civil and military legal proceedings.  </a></p>
<p><a id="239" name="239">However, a policy 
of zero tolerance of SGBV and CRSV through strong leadership, education and training needs 
to be addressed at all levels.</a></p>
<p><a id="240" name="240">In that regard, a CRSV committee at the National level and sub-
committees at the State level have now been established to implement the action plan.</a></p>

<p><a id="242" name="242">Status of Cantonment Sites and Training Centres 
28.  </a></p>
<p><a id="243" name="243">During the period of reporting, the logistical situation in  cantonment sites and training 
centres remained dire, with little, or no food and medicines made available to the majority of 
the forces.  </a></p>
<p><a id="244" name="244">As  a  result,  many troops deserted  and either  went  to  their homes or elsewhere in 
search of food,  essential life support commodities  and shelter.</a></p>
<p><a id="245" name="245">The lack  of  basic services in 
cantonment sites and training centres has, among other factors, contributed to the defection of a 

 

5 

high  number  of  Opposition  forces  to  the  SSPDF.  </a></p>
<p><a id="246" name="246">The  RTGoNU  has  consistently  failed  to 
provide the much needed funding and sufficient logistics to sustain troops in cantonment sites 
and training centers during this reporting period and indeed for the past two years.</a></p>

<p><a id="248" name="248">The Unification Process 
29.  </a></p>
<p><a id="249" name="249">The unification of the Necessary Unified Forces (NUF) continued to stagnate throughout 
the reporting period.</a></p>
<p><a id="250" name="250">Troops that were trained during the Phase I unification process failed to 
graduate and redeploy as required by the Agreement due to the lack of funding and resources, 
as well as a lack of political will by the RTGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="251" name="251">The impasse in reaching an agreement on 
both the force unification ratios and the unified command negotiations between the ITGoNU 
and the Opposition leadership, has significantly delayed the graduation and redeployment of the 
NUF.</a></p>
<p><a id="252" name="252">In addition, the SSPDF, SPLA-IO and SSOA have forces in training centres that were not 
properly screened.</a></p>
<p><a id="253" name="253">This was supposed to have been done prior to graduation and redeployment. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="254" name="254">Furthermore,  the  SSPDF,  SPLA-IO  and  SSOA,  have  a  significant  number  of  excess  senior 
officers  who  must  be  processed  before  the  unified  personnel  in  the  training  centres  finally 
graduate  and deploy.  </a></p>
<p><a id="255" name="255">All  these shortcomings contributed to  the stagnation of the unification, 
graduation and redeployment process, which has had a ‘knock-on’ adverse effect on the security 
situation in the respective states.</a></p>

<p><a id="257" name="257">30.  </a></p>
<p><a id="258" name="258">Following months of delays, the JDB, in mid-December 2021, received funding from the 
National Transition Committee (NTC) and deployed assessment teams to the respective training 
centres to commence the screening process.</a></p>
<p><a id="259" name="259">The screening will determine the eligibility of ex-

progress.</a></p>
<p><a id="264" name="264">Since the DDR Commission submitted its strategy, implementation plan and estimated

<p><a id="265" name="265">However,  in  an  effort  to  support  the  DDR  Commission  the 
development of a Community Violence Reduction/DDR pilot initiative has been initiated by the 
‘International  Friends  of  South  Sudan’  and  UNMISS,  which  aims  for  a  ‘bottom  up’  DDR 
approach, concentrating on the reintegration process in the states with the focus on the youth 
community.</a></p>
<p><a id="266" name="266">  
32.  </a></p>
<p><a id="267" name="267">The initiative has the support of the RTGoNU through the Chairperson of the NTC, whilst 
the Chairperson of the DDR Commission has been tasked to take the National ‘lead’ on this 
pilot  project.  </a></p>
<p><a id="268" name="268">The  inaugural  meeting  of  the  joint  technical  working  group  for  the  CVR/DDR 
Pilot  Scheme  took  place  on  10  December  2021  during  which  the  methodology  for  the  way 
forward  was  discussed.  </a></p>

the worst impacted states with 80% of the total number of affected people.  </a></p>
<p><a id="296" name="296">Hotspot areas, such 
as Bentiu in Unity State, remained vulnerable as floodwaters continued to rise.</a></p>
<p><a id="297" name="297">It is worrisome 
that floods are yet to recede after more than two years.</a></p>
<p><a id="298" name="298">If the floods do not recede before the

<p><a id="305" name="305">The  UN

39.  </a></p>
<p><a id="307" name="307">The security of humanitarian workers and  access to  people in  need remained a major 
concern  and  was  hampered  by  active  hostility    by  youth  groups,  bureaucratic  impediments,  
restriction of movement, operational interference,  ambush/robbery and looting of humanitarian 
assets.    </a></p>
<p><a id="308" name="308">This  led  to  the  relocation  of  humanitarian  workers  thus  affecting  operations.  </a></p>

continued  to  increase  following  the  provision  of  written  guarantees  of  safety  by  the  local 
authorities.  </a></p>

interventions in the previously affected areas.

<p><a id="311" name="311">According to UNOCHA, the killing of a humanitarian worker following an attack on a

41.  </a></p>
<p><a id="314" name="314">Food  security  continued  to  be  threatened  by  the  influx  of  cattle  into  farmlands.  </a></p>
<p><a id="315" name="315">Cattle 
migration into farming land was increasingly recognized as an economic problem, which also 
affected safety, security, and the environment as the migrations led to  conflict and fatalities, 
destruction of grazing areas and crops, and depleted natural resources.</a></p>
<p><a id="316" name="316">It was reported that the 
number of cattle camps in Kajo Keji County in Central Equatoria rose from two in October to 
seven by late November.</a></p>
<p><a id="317" name="317">In violation of previous agreements, herders were reportedly moving 
back into the Pageri and Magwi farming communities, which they had earlier vacated.</a></p>
<p><a id="318" name="318">Farmers 
are demanding that new  agreements  be made, including provisions to  force cattle keepers to 
move without guns.  
42. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="319" name="319">It is worth noting that some of the traditional rangelands used by livestock herders are in 
decline, changing from savannah to semi-arid conditions where water and grass is scarce.</a></p>
<p><a id="320" name="320">This

lends urgency to concerns around grazing, over-grazing and encroachment of livestock into food 
growing areas, which will need to be resolved by looking at legal issues that include the right to 
use,  control,  and  transfer  land,  sustainable  management  of  the  environment,  law  and  order, 
representation, and political influence.

<p><a id="458" name="458">In continuing efforts to build trust and confidence among the key leaders of the Parties 
to the R-ARCSS, the RJMEC held a high level workshop in Rwanda for senior government 
ministers and high ranking members of the military,9 referred to in this report’s discussion of 
Chapter II.</a></p>
<p><a id="459" name="459">The workshop used lessons from the Rwandan experience to remind participants of 
what could possibly happen in South Sudan if they fail to implement the R-ARCSS in letter 
and spirit.</a></p>
<p><a id="460" name="460">During the workshop, the several challenges facing the agreement were discussed 
including the failure of the RTGoNU to secure the necessary  resources for  implementation. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="461" name="461">The leaders promised to increase their efforts at transparency and accountability, and to provide 
the necessary funding for the R-ARCSS.  
64.  </a></p>
<p><a id="462" name="462">Having  identified  the  need  to  prioritize  enactment  of  several  pieces  of  pending 
legislation, the RJMEC Chairperson met with the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the TNL in 
November.</a></p>
<p><a id="463" name="463">The Chair discussed the need to immediately enact the pending legislation given 
its  importance  towards  strengthening  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="464" name="464">The  Bills  are  those 
already approved by the Council of Ministers including the SPLA Bill, 2009, National Security 
Service Bill, 2014,  Southern Sudan Police Service Bill, 2009, Southern Sudan Prison Service 
Bill,  2011,  Southern  Sudan  Wildlife  Service  Bill,  2011,  Political  Parties  Bill,  and  the 
Constitutional Amendment Bill.</a></p>
<p><a id="465" name="465">The Speaker noted that to date the only piece of legislation 
officially forwarded to the TNL was the Constitutional Amendment Bill and the intention was 
to debate it as soon as possible.</a></p>
<p><a id="466" name="466">The Speaker also noted that ongoing construction work aimed 
at providing sufficient space to accommodate all of the parliamentarians is ongoing, and that 
the TNL sub-committees will soon be set up.  
65.  </a></p>
<p><a id="467" name="467">Beyond  its  local  engagements,  the  leadership  undertook  overseas  tours  to  meet  with 
Regional leaders in efforts to secure their focus and participation in the Peace Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="468" name="468">In 
that regard, the Chairperson met with H.E Yoweri Museveni, President of Uganda, H.E Abdalla 
Hamdok,  Prime  Minister  of  Sudan,  and  H.E  Demeke  Mekonnen  Deputy  Prime  Minister  of 
Ethiopia.</a></p>
<p><a id="469" name="469">The Chairperson pressed the IGAD Heads to discourage defections within the armed 
forces, intervene in an effort to resolve the impasse related to the command structure and ratio 
sharing among  the armed Parties, and   to  move  ahead with   the high  level  retreat,  which is 
aimed at tackling the problem of the lack of political will and trust among the Parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="470" name="470">There 
were also meetings held with H.E. Dr. Workneh Gebeyehu, the IGAD Executive Secretary and 
Dr. Ismail Weis the IGAD Special Envoy to South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="471" name="471">Finally, the Leadership travelled to 
the United States in order to brief officials of the State Department, Senate and Congress to 
drum up support for the R-ARCSS.  
66.  </a></p>
<p><a id="472" name="472">The RJMEC Secretariat has continued to engage, within the framework of partnership 
with UNMISS.</a></p>
<p><a id="473" name="473">The Secretariat participated in leadership retreats of State Executives in Yei, 
Central Equatoria and Wau, Bahr-El Ghazal.</a></p>
<p><a id="474" name="474">RJMEC used the opportunity to elaborate on the 
Peace Agreement and provide update on the status of implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="475" name="475">In addition, the roles 
and responsibilities of the State actors as envisaged in the Agreement was made clear to the 
participants.</a></p>
<p><a id="476" name="476">The platforms also provided opportunities for the dissemination of the R-ARCSS 
at the subnational level.  
67.  </a></p>
<p><a id="477" name="477">Furthermore,  RJMEC  held  two  outreach  events  during  this  quarter.  </a></p>
<p><a id="478" name="478">The  first  was  a 
gender-specific  outreach  event  held  in  Juba  (29  September  –  1  October).  </a></p>
<p><a id="479" name="479">It  was  entitled

of the R-ARCSS for sustainable Peace in South Sudan.’</a></p>
<p><a id="486" name="486">The second was an outreach event held 
in the town of Yei, Central Equatoria (16-19 November 2021), reaching around 150 local civil 
society  leaders.  </a></p>
<p><a id="487" name="487">This  event  also  featured  one  day  specifically  aimed  at  women’s  leaders,  of 
whom 45 participated.</a></p>
<p><a id="488" name="488">The feedback from both events the participants was positive, and in Yei 
in  particular,  it  was  appreciated  that  greater  information  was  provided  about  the  work  and 
mandates of RJMEC and CTSAMVM, and in particular, participants appreciated the news on 
how  to  be  in  touch  with  CTSAMVM  on  the  ground.  </a></p>
<p><a id="489" name="489">Beyond  this,  RJMEC  continued  to  be 
active in the media, issuing press releases, interviewing on national radio, and writing articles 
in the national media.

   Observations  

these 

troubling 

to  negatively 

issues,  which  continue 

68.  </a></p>
<p><a id="492" name="492">The  report  notes  that  overall,  there  has  been  progress  in  the  implementation  of  some 
provisions  of  the  R-ARCSS  during  the  quarter.  </a></p>
<p><a id="493" name="493">Notably,  they  included  the  following:</a></p>
<p><a id="494" name="494"> </a></p>
<p><a id="495" name="495">(a) 
appointment of members of nine out of ten State Legislative Assemblies;</a></p>
<p><a id="496" name="496">(b) approval of key 
pieces of legislation by the Council of Ministers;</a></p>
<p><a id="497" name="497">(c) completion of nominations to the JRC;</a></p>
<p><a id="498" name="498">(d) 
sustaining of the Permanent Ceasefire among the Parties;</a></p>
<p><a id="499" name="499">and (e) completion of some PFM and 
economic reforms including stabilising the exchange rate and reducing inflation.</a></p>
<p><a id="500" name="500">However, the 
failure of the RTGoNU to make progress on Transitional Justice issues is a source of much 
concern and frustration.    
69.  </a></p>
<p><a id="501" name="501">Ongoing intercommunal violence in several states combined with the dire humanitarian 
situation  remain  of  considerable  concern.  </a></p>
<p><a id="502" name="502">The  RTGoNU  must  therefore  continue  to  exert 
efforts  at  addressing 
impact 
implementation of the R-ARCSS and fostering lasting peace.</a></p>
<p><a id="503" name="503">The JDB must be commended 
for its positive intervention in the Tambura situation, which appears to have, at least for the 
time being, amicably resolved the situation.</a></p>
<p><a id="504" name="504">However, the human cost and suffering associated 
with the conflict is indeed regrettable.</a></p>
<p><a id="505" name="505">Also to be commended is the efforts being made to curb 
incidences of SGBV by prosecuting offenders and also through the launch of  the action plan 
for addressing CRSV. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="506" name="506">70.  </a></p>
<p><a id="507" name="507">The RTGoNU’s ongoing focus on PFM reforms should continue and increase in the pace 
of implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="508" name="508">These reforms are quite meaningful and has already borne fruit through the 
stabilization of the exchange rate.</a></p>
<p><a id="509" name="509">More importantly, successful implementation will establish 
the  belief  among  the  general  public  that  the  dividends  of  peace  will  ultimately  impact  their 
lives.</a></p>
<p><a id="510" name="510">Similarly, a move by the RTGoNU to operationalise the Enterprise Development Funds 
consistent with Article 4.15 of the R-ARCSS, will go a long way to enhancing the livelihoods 
of the most vulnerable of the population.  
71.  </a></p>
<p><a id="511" name="511">There has been a lot of discussion surrounding elections at the end of the Transitional 
Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="512" name="512">It is therefore important to stress key areas within the Agreement that must be attended 
to in order to foster trust and confidence in the resulting elections results, this include:</a></p>
<p><a id="513" name="513">(</a></p>
<p><a id="514" name="514">i) the 
unification and redeployment of the forces of the armed Parties to the Agreement, and the DDR 
conducted;</a></p>
<p><a id="515" name="515">(ii)   the completion  of the Permanent Constitution-making process   to  guide the 
conduct of elections;</a></p>
<p><a id="516" name="516">(iii) review of the National Elections Act 2012 and the Political Parties 
Act 2012, and reconstituting of the National Elections Commission and the Political Parties

<p><a id="517" name="517"> </a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="559" name="559">Conclusion 

73. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="560" name="560">This report shows that there was very limited progress made in the implementation of 
the  R-ARCSS  during  the  period  under  review.  </a></p>
<p><a id="561" name="561">Of  particular  concern  is  the  failure  of  the 
RTGoNU to provide the necessary resources to complete the critical process of the graduation 
and deployment of Phase 1 of the NUF.</a></p>
<p><a id="562" name="562">Also of concern is the delay, up to now, of the TNLA 
to  enact  the  pending  legislation,  which  is  critical  in  support  of  the implementation  of  the  R-
ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="563" name="563">With the exception of the PFM reforms within the context of Chapter  IV of the R-
ARCSS, there was hardly any progress within the other chapters, which can only increase the 
frustrations of the wider population that the Agreement is not having the desired impact on their 
lives.  </a></p>
<p><a id="564" name="564">This  growing  frustration  is  only  compounded  by  the  ongoing  floods  and  other 
humanitarian concerns as well as continuing inter-communal violence;</a></p>
<p><a id="565" name="565">all negatively impacting 
the people of South Sudan.   
74. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="566" name="566">Looking  ahead,  particularly  in  view  of  the  holding  of  elections  at  the  end  of  the 
Transitional Period, it is imperative that the RTGoNU complete the TSA’s, continue to lay the
