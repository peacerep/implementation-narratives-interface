RAPE IN MUNDRI
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
On the night of / August 2020 six (6) men entered a compound at Hai Baraka near
Mundri.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">Four (4) of them were soldiers from the SPLM/A-IO Division 9A and were
assigned as bodyguards of the Divisional Commander.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">They appeared to be looking for a man, who ran away before they were able to
apprehend him.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">However, they stole goods from his house and took both his wife and
sister from the compound and raped them at gunpoint.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">Both the survivors were
minors:</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">one aged 16 and the other 17.
</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">The survivors knew their assailants and reported them to the authorities.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">When the
SPLM/A-IO headquarters in Mundri were made aware of the incident, they carried out
an investigation and arrested the suspects who were handed over to the police.
</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">According to the latest information available to CTSAMVM the suspects had been
remanded by the local court for trial at the criminal court in Mundri.
</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">CTSAMVM investigated the incident and has clear grounds to believe that four (4)
SPLM/A-IO soldiers from Division 9A did rape the two girls.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">This is a clear violation of
the R-ARCSS.
</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">However, CTSAMVM commends the SPLM/A-IO who acted quickly, and arrested
those involved and ensured they faced justice for what they did.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">CTSAMVM
recommends that the SPLM/A-IO takes the appropriate remedial action to stop such
incidents from recurring.
RAPE IN MUNDRI
Introduction
1.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">

</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">a. Mundri County has faced issues of insecurity as a result of the alleged activities
of NAS in the area.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">However, until early August 2020 there had been no recent
allegations of SGBV involving the Parties to the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">

</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">b. Military forces located in the area of Mundri town consist of the HQ of SSPDF
BN 163 HQ, and the HQ of SPLM/A-IO Division 9A. SPLM/A-IO Division 9A is
at Ngiri, but the commander relocated the HQ to Mundri because of network
coverage issues.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">

</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">c. On  August 2020 CTSAMVM received information from the commander of the
SSPDF Battalion in Mundri that in the early hours on the previous night (the
night of / August) two women had been raped at their home in the Hai Baraka
area in Mundri by suspected IO Soldiers

<p><a id="33" name="33">

</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">a.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">On  August 2020 CTSAMVM made contact with the SSNPS Special Protection
officer at Mundri, who confirmed that the rapes had taken place and that the
SSNPS had  suspects in custody,  of whom were SPLM/A-IO Soldiers, and
one of the others was the son of an SPLM/A-IO commander.

</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">On 20 August 2020 the CTSAMVM MVT based in Yambio deployed to Mundri
in order to investigate the incident.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">A total of 12 witnesses were interviewed,
including the senior police officer in Mundri (the Police Commissioner of the
former Amadi State) and Special Protection Officer, the survivors and their
family members, a senior SPLM/A-IO officer from Division 9A and  of the
suspects.

</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">c.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">The evidence in this report is extracted from an investigation report prepared by
MVT Yambio.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">The investigation report was signed by International Observers
and National Monitors and discussed with Senior National Liaison Officers.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">The
names of witnesses and survivors are not included in this report in order to
protect individuals.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">

</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">d. The standard of proof used by the CTSAMVM to determine whether there is
sufficient evidence to verify that a Party-Signatory is not in compliance with the
provisions of the Agreements is “reasonable grounds to believe that the incident
that is the subject of the investigation occurred.”</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">This is in accordance with
accepted practice for monitoring mechanisms and humanitarian entities and
signifies that sufficient facts and evidence have been collected to conclude that
an event has occurred.</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">Findings

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">At about midnight on the night of / August 2020, six (6) men broke into a

other) ran to the police station in Mundri and reported the incident at about 0220
Hrs.

<p><a id="50" name="50">The reason they broke into the compound is not clear, although they initially asked
for the brother of one of the survivors, who was also the husband of the second
survivor.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">He was subsequently arrested by the SSNPS for unspecified crimes.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">He
ran away when the armed men entered the compound because he said he thought
they were NAS.

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">The survivors knew their assailants and recognised them.  </a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">of them were SPLM/A-

were stolen.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">The rapes took place at gunpoint.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">Both girls reported they were raped
by two men whilst a third stood guard

6.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Survivor  (aged 16) narrated how she was woken up by men wanting her brother.
</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">They went to her brother’s tukul</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">but he had gone and only his wife was there.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">Two
men went into the tukul and one stood guard.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">The other  men asked her to show
them the way to the main road to town.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">On the way to the main road, one of the
men pointed a gun on her chest and asked her if she wanted to be shot or to be
raped.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">She said that if they did anything she would report them because she knew
them all.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">One of the men slapped her and when she fell to the ground two men
raped her while the third one stood guard.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">She gave the names of those who raped
her.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">She was told to go home after they had finished.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">Survivor  (aged 17) stated that on  Aug 2020 at around midnight she was
sleeping with her husband when she heard the dogs barking and the noise of men
moving outside.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">Her husband ran away, exiting through the window.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">Two men
entered the tukul while one remained outside.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">They searched the tukul and took 
mobile phones, money and other items of value.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">One of the men received a Call,
and she overheard him being told to leave the compound.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">They then left with her,
and after moving about 600m from the compound they asked her to choose
between being killed or being raped.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">She said she would rather be killed but was
thrown to the ground and raped by two men, both of whom she knew and could
identify.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">Following the incident, the survivors were taken to Mundri for medical treatment.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">The Chief of Military Intelligence of SPLM/A-IO Division 9A told CTSAMVM that
when the HQ was informed about the incident and involvement of SPLM/A-IO
soldiers, an investigation took place at the suspects arrested.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">He emphasised that
the SPLM/A-IO will not protect criminals, and if the suspects are found guilty they
will face the consequences.

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">The Police Commissioner said there was no criminal court in the area, and that the
cases were initially being heard by a local (traditional) court.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">CTSAMVM learnt

later that the local court referred the cases to the court in Maridi, because they
were too serious for the local court to deal with.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">As at 31 August the suspects were
still in jail in Mundri awaiting transport to Maridi.

</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">Assessment

11.All the evidence gathered by CTSAMVM clearly indicate that SPLM/A-IO soldiers
were involved with the rape of two young women in Mundri on the night of the /
August 2019.

12.The SPLM/A-IO cooperated fully with the local authorities and  arrested the
suspects, who are facing justice and will be held accountable.

</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">Conclusion

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">CTSAMVM has reasonable grounds to believe that armed uniformed soldiers from
the SPLM/A-IO raped two minors on the night of / August 2020, and that
constitutes a clear violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically Article 2.1.10.0 

Observations and Recommendations

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">Violations of the R-ARCSS are reported in order for there to be remedial action
and accountability.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">The action taken by the SPLM/A-IO to arrest those involved
with the incident and ensure they are held to account is commendable.

</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">15.CTSAMVM recommends the SPLM/A-IO takes the appropriate remedial action
and preventative measures to stop such incidents reoccurring.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">It is important that
all personnel are not only educated about protection of civilians and SGBV issues,
but also made fully aware that they will face the consequences should they
transgress.
