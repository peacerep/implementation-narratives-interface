Executive Summary 

</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">This Report on the status of implementation of the activities of the Revitalised Agreement 
on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) is prepared 
pursuant to Chapter VII, Article 7.9 of the R-ARCSS and covers the period 1st April to 30th 
June 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">The Report highlights some of the key activities undertaken over the last three 
months of the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">Among these is reporting on the seven Pre-Transitional 
tasks carried over after the initial formation of the Revitalised Transitional Government of 
National Unity (RTGoNU) on 22nd February 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45"> 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">During the reporting period, implementation of the R-ACRSS slowed markedly, with the 
onset  of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as delays by the Agreement Parties in  reaching 
agreement on the responsibility sharing at the state and local government levels.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">This delay 
has impacted negatively on the formation of the Transitional National Legislature (TNL), 
and  contributed  to  a  security  vacuum  in  several  states;</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48"> </a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">evidenced  by  escalating  inter-
communal violence in the states of Warrap, Lakes, Unity and Jonglei.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">Countless numbers 
of individuals have been killed and others wounded in ongoing cattle rustling episodes and 
revenge attacks. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">More recently, some progress was seemingly made with regards to reaching an agreement 
between the Parties on the responsibility sharing at the state and local government levels. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">Bilateral discussions between President Salva Kiir Mayardit and the First Vice President Dr 
Riek Machar resulted in the former ITGoNU agreeing to nominate governors to the states 
of Unity, Eastern Equatoria, Warrap, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Central Equatoria and Lakes. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">The SPLM/A-IO nominated governors for the states of Upper Nile, Western Bahr el Ghazal, 
and  Western  Equatoria;</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54"> </a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">and  SSOA  for  Jonglei  state.  </a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">However,  four  of  the  six  parties 
comprising the Other Political Parties (OPP) have strenuously rejected the decision, arguing 
that it amounted to a violation of  Article 1.16.1.4  of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Notwithstanding  the 
objections, on 29 June President Kiir through Republican Decrees No. 51/2020 and 53/2020, 
named  eight  of  the  ten  governors  and  three  Chief  Administrators  of  the  Administrative 
Areas respectively.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58"> 
 
 </a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">The NCAC is established under Article 1.18.1 of the R-ARCSS and is mandated to revise 
or draft new laws, as appropriate, and also review other legislation as provided for in the 
Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">During the reporting period, the NCAC continued with the review of the Public 
Financial Management and Accountability Act, 2011 pursuant to Articles 4.12.1, 4.12.1.1, 
to 4.12.1.8;</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">and  Southern Sudan National Audit Chamber Act, 2011 pursuant to Article 4.5 
of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">The first drafts of the bills were prepared and distributed to the Committee 
members for comments and input.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Following the response by the members, second drafts 
were prepared to incorporate the members’ responses and circulated.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">The bill together with 
explanatory notes is now ready for stakeholders’ validation.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Concerning  the  status  of  implementation  of  the  Transitional  Security  Arrangements, 
CTSAMVM reports indicate that  some 37,000 personnel  remain  at  cantonment sites and 

 

  
 iv 

barracks while around 47,000 are at the training centres, including close to 5,000 female 
trainees.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">Registration and screening have been put on hold and formal, detailed unification 
training  was  halted  as  at  27th  March  2020,  in  efforts  to  manage  the  threat  of  COVID-19 
nationwide.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">Also, plans to complete graduation at all training centres within 30 days from 
28 May 2020, followed by immediate redeployment of the NUF have not materialised.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">In 
the  meantime,  both  the  training  centres  and  cantonment  sites  continue  to  be  affected  by 
severe  food  shortages,  lack  of  medicines,  and  care  facilities  for  the  female  personnel. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">Consequently, there continues to be high levels of the forces’ abandoning the cantonment 
sites and training centres.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">The  humanitarian  situation  in  South  Sudan  has  worsened  in  the  recent  past,  with  the 
escalating  level  of  inter-communal  violence  and  the  continued  armed  clashes  in  the 
Equatorias.  </a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">This  violence  is  now  the  leading  cause  of  death  and  distress;</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74"> </a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">which  is 
compounded  by  human  rights  abuses  and  growing  incidents  of  sexual  and  gender-based 
violence  (SGBV)  against  young  girls  and  women.  </a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">Meanwhile,  the  combined  impacts  of 
declining world oil prices and the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increases in the prices of 
basic food items, and a deterioration in the government revenues, further complicating basic 
livelihood.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">Consistent  with  Articles  </a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">5.1.4  and  5.1.5  of  the  R-ARCSS,  the  RTGoNU  is  expected  to 
receive  support  from  the  UN,  AU  and  the  African  Commission  on  Human  and  People’s 
Rights  (ACPHR)  in  furtherance  of  the  implementation  of  Chapter  V  of  the  R-ARCSS. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">Regrettably,  no  such  support  has  reportedly  been  received.  </a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">The  support  to  be  delivered 
revolves  around  design,  implementation  and  facilitation  of  the  work  of  Chapter  V 
mechanisms during the  Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">They  are the Commission  on Truth,  </a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">Healing 
and  Reconciliation  (CTRH),  the  Hybrid  Court  for  South  Sudan  (HCSS)  and  the 
Compensation and Reparation Authority (CRA).   
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">With respect to the permanent constitution-making process envisaged under Chapter VI of 
the  R-ARCSS,  the  RTGoNU  has,  in  concurrence  with  the  RJMEC’s  Monitoring  and 
Evaluation Matrix identified eleven (11) key tasks as critical for implementation during the 
Transitional  Period.  </a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">These  include:</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86"> </a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">the  RTGoNU  to  initiate  and  oversee  a  permanent 
constitutional-making  process  during  the  Transitional  Period,  and  to  budget  adequate 
funding;</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88"> </a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">and  the  RJMEC  to  identify  and  engage  renowned  institutes  to  facilitate  and 
moderate the permanent constitution-making process workshop and to convene a workshop 
for  the  Parties  to  agree  on  the  details  of  conducting  the  permanent  constitution-making 
process.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90"> 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">Besides the COVID-19 pandemic, the RJMEC regards inter-communal violence as a major 
risk  factor,  at  this  time,  to  the  successful  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">It,  urges  the 
Parties  to  the  Agreement,  to  step  up  their  own  efforts  at  bringing  peace  to  the  troubled 
communities.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">In that regard, the recent progress made in moving closer to a resolution in 
responsibility sharing is a very welcomed development.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">However, it is critical that all the 

 

  
 v 

Agreement  Parties  are  fully  on  board  with  the  compromises  being  made  in  the  spirit  of 
collegiality, and continued collaboration in the implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">Changes 
made to the ratios contained in Article 1.16.1 of the R-ARCSS on responsibility sharing, 
amounts to an amendment to the provision and requires that the Parties follow the procedure 
laid down in Article 8.4 of the R-ARCSS.

1.  </a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">This Report on the status of implementation of the tasks of the Revitalised Agreement on 
the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) is prepared 
pursuant to Chapter VII, Article 7.9 of the R-ARCSS and covers the period 1st April to 
30th June 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">It builds on the previous quarterly reports published since the signing of 
the R-ARCSS on 12th September 2018, namely numbers 001/19, 002/19, 003/19, 004/19,

2.  </a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">During the reporting period, implementation of the R-ARCSS virtually stalled with the 
onset  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  slow  progress  made  by  the  Parties  to  the 
Agreement  on  resolving  the  issue  of  responsibility  sharing  at  the  State  and  local 
government 
limited  number  of 
accomplishments observed to date, and the challenges that must be addressed in order to 
move the implementation of the R-ARCSS forward.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">These include the persistent delays 
in  the  restructuring  and  reconstitution  of  the  Transitional  National  Legislature  (TNL), 
comprising  both  the  Transitional  National  Legislative  Assembly  (TNLA)  and  the 
Council of States (CoS).</a></p>

the

<p><a id="104" name="104">Also highlighted in the Report is the status of implementation of several Pre-Transitional 
tasks that were extended into the Transitional Period.2 Of note, are those related to the 
Transitional Security Arrangements, and in particular, the selection, screening, training 
and redeployment of the Necessary Unified Forces (NUF).</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">In addition, the Report details 
violation committed in the course of implementation of the R-ARCSS, and the measures 
put  forward  by  the  Reconstituted  Joint  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Commission 
(RJMEC) for corrective action by the Parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">Among these is the failure to strictly adhere 
to  the  provisions  of  the  R-ARCSS  in  the  making  of  political  and  professional 
appointments  within  the  Revitalized  Transitional  Government  of  National  Unity 
(RTGoNU).</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">

4.  </a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">The humanitarian situation worsened during the reporting period with scores of civilians 
killed, and thousands displaced as a result of escalating inter-communal violence linked 
to cattle rustling and revenge attacks.</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">There has also been increasing reports of attacks 
against  humanitarian  workers,  and  a  near-complete  halt  to  the  voluntary  return  of 
Internally  Displaced  Persons  (IDPs),  and  refugees.  </a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">With  regards  to  the  economy,  the 
continuing  low  world  oil  prices  has  led  to  higher  consumer  prices  and  declining 
government revenue.</a></p>

<p><a id="113" name="113">

2  Tasks  to  be  implemented  during  the  entire  period  of  the  Agreement  are  distributed  between  a  Pre-
Transitional Period and a Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">The Pre-Transitional Period started with the signing of the 
R-ARCSS on 12 September 2018 and ended on 21 February 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">The Transitional Period started on 22 
February 2020 with the formation of the RTGoNU, and is expected to last until the holding of elections, 
no later than February 2023.

<p><a id="118" name="118">Status of Implementation of the Revitalised Peace Agreement 

Overview 

6.  </a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">The implementation of the R-ACRSS was slowed down during the quarter under review 
with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as delays by the Agreement Parties 
in  reaching  agreement  on  the  responsibility  sharing  at  the  state  and  local  government 
levels.  </a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">This  delay has impacted negatively on the formation of the TNLA,  resulted in 
leadership  vacuum  in  the  states  which  also  contributed  to  an  increase  in  the  level  of 
insecurity  in  some  parts  of  the  country.  </a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">This  is  evidenced  by  the  escalation  of 
intercommunal  violence  in  the  states  of  Warrap,  Lakes,  Unity  and  Jonglei.  </a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">Many 
individuals have been killed and others wounded in ongoing cattle raiding episodes and 
revenge attacks.  

7.  </a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">Overall,  there  has  been  some  progress  made  with  regards  to  reaching  an  agreement 
between  the  Parties  on  the  responsibility  sharing  at  the  State  and  Local  Government 
levels.</a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">However, there is little or no progress in most of the areas where implementation 
was expected to take place during the first four months of the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">These 
include restructuring and reconstitution of the TNLA and the training and redeployment 
of the NUF.</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">These are two of the seven Pre-Transitional tasks that the Parties agreed to 
implement within the Transitional Period.3 

8.  </a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">Concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic and its quick spread, particularly in Juba, has 
further complicated  progress  of the first  phase of  the unification of forces, which was 
expected  to  have  been  completed  during  the  first  few  months  of  the  RTGoNU  being 
formed.</a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">Training has stalled, and without budgetary allocation from Juba, not much can 
happen.</a></p>
<p><a id="129" name="129">In the meantime, ex-combatants will continue to abandon the cantonment sites 
and training centres due to lack of basic supplies such as food and medicine.</a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">This is a 
serious drawback on Unification of organised forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">  

</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">Chapter I – Revitalised Transitional Government of National Unity 

9.  </a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">Progress in implementation of Chapter I of the R-ARCSS has been rather slow during 
the reporting period.</a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">The RTGoNU Presidency was established on 22 February 2020 and 
the RTGoNU Council of Ministers on 17 March.</a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">These positive developments had raised

<p><a id="315" name="315">The initial plan was to complete graduation at all training centres within 30 days

<p><a id="458" name="458">According to the IMF, Real GDP growth in South Sudan is projected to increase by 4.9% 
in the year to the end of December 2020 (as against 7.9% projected in October 2019). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="459" name="459">The  reduction  in  projected  growth  is  mainly  due  to  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19 
pandemic including job losses, lower income, and a consequent reduction in purchasing 
power.</a></p>
<p><a id="460" name="460">At the same time, food prices increased well over the seasonal high because of 
stockpiling by households, in anticipation of stricter containment measures, and induced 
border restrictions for regional trade.  

66.  </a></p>
<p><a id="461" name="461">The strongest economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on South Sudan’s economy 
has come through the sharp decline in world oil prices.</a></p>
<p><a id="462" name="462">The resulting strong deterioration 
in export earnings from oil has weakened the country’s external position and led to a loss 
of  international  foreign  reserves,  and  a  widening  of  the  current  account  deficit.  </a></p>
<p><a id="463" name="463">In 
addition, it has contributed to a large decline in the country’s revenues thus adversely 
impacting budgetary operations.</a></p>

67.  </a></p>
<p><a id="465" name="465">Based on the expected long-term decline in revenues the government has embarked on

<p><a id="547" name="547">The  interim  Chairperson  carefully  laid  out  the 
impediments to implementation, by detailing the several violations of the R-ARCSS, and 
the Parties unwillingness  to  compromise on the responsibility sharing at  the State and 
local  government 
levels.  </a></p>
<p><a id="548" name="548">The  Interim  Chairperson  also  detailed  a  series  of

recommendations were largely adopted by the Council and formed the basis of very clear

<p><a id="568" name="568">Observations and Recommendations 

84.  </a></p>
<p><a id="569" name="569">The RJMEC leadership has identified inter-communal violence as a major risk factor, at 
this time, to the successful implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="570" name="570">The persistent violence has 
resulted  in  scores  of  death  and  thousands  of  civilians  have  fled  their  homes  seeking 
security elsewhere.</a></p>
<p><a id="571" name="571">In that regard, it welcomes the recent announcement of the formation 
of  a  Committee  to  investigate  the  violence,  which  is  headed  by  Dr  Wani  </a></p>
<p><a id="572" name="572">Igga,  Vice 
President.  </a></p>
<p><a id="573" name="573">The  Committee  is  tasked  with:</a></p>
<p><a id="574" name="574"> </a></p>
<p><a id="575" name="575">(i)  coordinating  with  government  and 
humanitarian agencies to provide relief;</a></p>
<p><a id="576" name="576">(ii) meet with community elders of Jonglei state 
and  Pibor;</a></p>
<p><a id="577" name="577"> </a></p>
<p><a id="578" name="578">(iii)  identify  root  causes  of  communal  fighting;</a></p>
<p><a id="579" name="579"> </a></p>
<p><a id="580" name="580">and  (iv)  organize  a  peace 
conference of stakeholders.</a></p>
<p><a id="581" name="581">The Committee has 21 days to issue a report to the president 
on its findings.</a></p>
<p><a id="582" name="582">

85.  </a></p>
<p><a id="583" name="583">Beyond the work of the Committee, RJMEC encourages the Parties to the Agreement, to 
step up their own efforts at bringing peace to the troubled communities.</a></p>
<p><a id="584" name="584">In the last quarter 
Report,  the  RJMEC  Interim  Chairperson  warned  about  the  security  vacuum  that  was 
created  due  to  the  delayed  resolution  of  responsibility  sharing  at  the  state  level, 
particularly  as  it  relates  to  the  appointment  of  Governors.  </a></p>
<p><a id="585" name="585">In  that  regard,  the  recent 
progress  made  in  moving  closer  to  a  resolution  in  responsibility  sharing  is  a  very 
welcomed development.</a></p>
<p><a id="586" name="586">

86.  </a></p>
<p><a id="587" name="587">It  is,  however,  important  that  all  the  Agreement  Parties  are  fully  on  board  with  the 
compromises being made in the spirit of collegiality, and continued collaboration in the 
implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="588" name="588">Changes made to Article 1.16.1 of the R-ARCSS on 
responsibility sharing, amounts to an amendment to its provision, and requires that the

<p><a id="596" name="596">RJMEC  continues  to  appeal  strongly  to  all  the  parties  involved  in  hostilities  in  the 
Equatorias  to  cease  with  immediate  effect  and  to  pursue  peace,  consistent  with  the 
Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (CoHA) signed in Addis Ababa in 2017 and the Rome 
Declaration of January 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="597" name="597">The fighting in this area has destabilised the Equatorias, a 
situation made worse by reports of rape and violence against women.</a></p>
<p><a id="598" name="598">More generally, 
reports of SGBV incidents, constitute serious violations of the R-ARCSS and CoHA in

<p><a id="602" name="602">They  are  also  encouraged  to  continue  to 
educate their forces on the provisions of the R-ARCSS, and to implement their respective 
action plans on addressing conflict-related sexual violence.</a></p>
<p><a id="603" name="603">

89.  </a></p>
<p><a id="604" name="604">During this relatively early stage of the Transitional Period, it was hoped that the progress 
with  implementation  of  the  critical  Pre-Transitional  tasks  deferred  to  the  Transitional 
Period, in particular, the Transitional Security Arrangements (TSAs), would have been 
completed  to  enable  redeployment  of  the  NUF,  but  this  has  not  been  the  case. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="605" name="605">Notwithstanding the adverse effects and restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic 
and the delays in fully establishing the RTGoNU, progress in completing the TSAs and 
outstanding Pre-Transitional security tasks has been slow.</a></p>
<p><a id="606" name="606">

90.  </a></p>
<p><a id="607" name="607">The status of cantonment sites remains problematic, as they continue to be abandoned by 
personnel in search of food and life support.  </a></p>
<p><a id="608" name="608">The JDB and JMCC still do not appear to 
have  central  oversight  of  the  state  and  condition  of  the  cantonment  sites.  </a></p>
<p><a id="609" name="609">It  remains 
unclear as to how many of the sites remain operational, the numbers of personnel in the 
sites and the state of logistic support and operational  needs.</a></p>
<p><a id="610" name="610">However, it is  clear from 
recent CTSAMVM reports that more needs to be done regarding the delivery of essential 
logistic  support,  particularly  food,  medicines  and  shelter  equipment  to  both  training 
centres  and  cantonment  sites,  a  severe  lack  of  which  is  creating  concern  in  terms  of 
command and control, management and morale.  

91.  </a></p>
<p><a id="611" name="611">Very  little  progress  has  been  made  in  the  critically  important  task  of  the  screening, 
training  and  redeployment  of  the  NUF.25  </a></p>
<p><a id="612" name="612">Moreover,  the  provision  of  logistic  support 
essential to maintain the operationalisation of the cantonment sites and training centres 
remain  woefully  inadequate,  and  in  particular  food,  medicines  and  shelter.  </a></p>
<p><a id="613" name="613">This  has 
contributed  to  the  large  numbers  of  personnel  abandoning  both  cantonment  sites  and 
training centres.</a></p>

24 “This Revitalised Agreement may be amended by the Parties , with at least two-thirds of the members 
of  the  Council  of  Ministers  of  the  RTGoNU,  and,  at  least  two-thirds  of  the  voting  members  of  the 
Revitalised  Joint  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Commission  consenting  to  the  amendment,  followed  by 
ratification by the TNL, according to the constitutional amendment procedures set out in the TCRSS, 
2011 (as amended).”</a></p>
<p><a id="615" name="615">

25 The 47 000 personnel in the training centres represent just over half of the 83,000 planned for the NUF 
and the 35,000 currently in cantonment sites and barracks are waiting for instructions to move to training 
centres for Phase 2 of the unification training.</a></p>

92.  </a></p>
<p><a id="617" name="617">The situation has been eased by the fact that a significant number of these individuals are 
cantoned  in  sites  close  to  their  own  people,  who  continue  to  support  them.  </a></p>
<p><a id="618" name="618">However, 
cantonment  sites  and  training  centres  cannot  sustain  the  continued  neglect  by  the 
RTGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="619" name="619">It is important that they remain operational in order to provide some support 
to those not selected for the NUF training, or failing to complete the training, and those 
who have elected to join the DDR process.</a></p>
<p><a id="620" name="620">This is crucially relevant at a time when the 
DDR Commission is not yet operational.

<p><a id="621" name="621">Concerning the implementation of Chapter V as it relates to Transitional Justice issues, 
RJMEC urges the RTGoNU to initiate engagement with the UN, AU and ACPHR with

<p><a id="629" name="629">Conclusion 

94.  </a></p>
<p><a id="630" name="630">The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed implementation of the R-ARCSS, but 
cannot be blamed for the non-implementation of some tasks that were expected to have 
been  undertaken  during  the  reporting  period.  </a></p>
<p><a id="631" name="631">The  delayed  process  in  resolving  the 
responsibility  sharing  at  the  state  and  local  government  levels,  only  exacerbated  the 
intercommunal  violence  and  contributed  to  the  worsening  humanitarian  situation.  </a></p>
<p><a id="632" name="632">The 
Parties to the Agreement must be reminded of their obligation to faithfully undertake the 
implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="633" name="633">Going  forward,  that  means  moving  quickly  to 
complete  the  structures  of  the  RTGoNU,  including  immediate  reconstitution  of  the 
TNLA, completing the Transitional Security Arrangements, initiating key economic and 
political reforms, and initiating establishment of the Transitional Justice institutions.</a></p>
<p><a id="634" name="634">

95.  </a></p>
<p><a id="635" name="635">RJMEC on its part shall continue to impartially monitor, evaluate and report as it carries 
out  its oversight  responsibilities with  regards to  the implementation  of the R-ARCSS, 
and intervene whenever necessary.</a></p>
<p><a id="636" name="636">RJMEC will also continue providing regular reports 
and  briefings  to  the  RTGoNU,  the  TNLA,  the  Chairperson  of  the  IGAD  Council  of 
Ministers, the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, the AU Peace and Security 
Council, and to the UN Secretary-General and the United Nations Security Council.
