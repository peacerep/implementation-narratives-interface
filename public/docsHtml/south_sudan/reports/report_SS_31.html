Executive Summary 

</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">This Report which covers the period from May 1st to July 31st 2017 highlights the 
prevailing political, security, humanitarian and economic situation in the Republic 
of South Sudan and the status of implementation of the Peace Agreement. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">Importantly it highlights the critical role of the proposed IGAD led High Level 
Revitalisation process.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">It presents a series of observations and makes 
recommendations to address some of the shortcomings in the implementation 
process.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">In its effort to improve monitoring of the Peace Agreement, JMEC established six 
Working Committees, according to the Chapters of the Peace Agreement, which 
work in close consultation with the three TGoNU clusters -- Governance, 
Economy and Service Delivery.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">These thematic Working Committees have met a 
combined total of 24 times since March 2017 to evaluate progress in 
implementation and act as oversight platforms to provide advice and recommend 
remedial action, which are then forwarded to the JMEC Chairperson.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">

</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">Only modest progress has been made in the implementation of the Peace 
Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">With regards to Chapter I while the National Constitutional 
Amendment Committee had completed the drafting of the Constitutional 
Amendment Bill (2017), it has not yet come into force as was envisaged under the 
Peace Agreement and the draft remains within the Ministry of Justice.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Also, the 
post of the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation 
allocated to the Former Detainees remains vacant, and the 25 percent quota for 
women participation in the Executive, Council of Ministers and Deputy Ministers 
has not been met.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">

</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">In spite of the unilateral declaration of a ceasefire by H.E President Salva Kiir 
Mayardit, there were reports of continuing and increasing incidents of targeted 
and retaliatory violence committed by uniformed forces as well as Other Armed 
Groups in different parts of the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">Meanwhile, work within the Transitional 
Security Arrangements mechanisms such as the Joint Military Ceasefire 
Commission, the Joint Operations Centre, the Joint Integrated Police-Management 
Team, and the Strategic Defence and Security Review Board continued, with 
varying results.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">Promised funding by the TGoNU in support of these Chapter II 
mechanisms had not yet materialized, which delayed the implementation of 
several critical components.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">

</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">The humanitarian situation in the country remains dire.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">This is evidenced by 
increasing levels of food insecurity, larger numbers of South Sudanese seeking 
refuge in neighbouring countries and within camps in South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">There are also 
difficulties encountered in securing humanitarian access.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">The situation is 
compounded by an outbreak of cholera and a rise in the incidence of malaria, 
which has resulted in several deaths and continues to affect significant numbers of 
people across the country.</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">The TGoNU has made some progress in reducing the high level of economic 
instability experienced during 2016 by lowering their level of borrowing from the 

 

4 

Central Bank and in the process keeping inflation levels down as well as checking 
the slide in the exchange rate.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Other efforts by TGoNU to improve and streamline 
expenditure management, eliminate the fuel subsidy, consolidate and reduce 
domestic arrears, establish the National Revenue Authority, and enact appropriate 
legislation can have the impact of further improving economic stability.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">Together 
with the unveiling of the National Development Strategy and efforts to increase 
oil production it will be better placed to secure future gains once the conflict ends.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">

</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Preparatory work on the formation of the Commission for Truth, Reconciliation 
and Healing is underway.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">The multi stakeholder committee has commenced 
outreach to stakeholders in the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">In addition, the Africa Union Commission 
Office of the Legal Counsel held consultations with the TGoNU on the technical 
aspects of the formation of the Hybrid Court and agreed on a draft roadmap for 
the court’s establishment.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">

</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">Under Chapter VI of the Peace Agreement, the TGoNU was required to initiate 
and oversee a permanent Constitution-making process within the first six (6) 
months.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">The process was expected to be completed within eighteen (18) months 
into the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">The permanent Constitution-making process has not 
yet started, and a credible Constitutional making process will require considerable 
time.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">

</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">The Chairperson of JMEC continued his engagement with the top leadership of 
the TGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">He also engaged in further diplomatic missions with the leadership of 
the United Nations, the African Union Commission, IGAD, and the various 
dedicated Special Envoys, all with the intention of finding a path out of the 
current crisis.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">To this end the Chairperson stressed the need for all international 
stakeholders to speak with ‘One Voice’ and encourage a political solution to the 
conflict in the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">

</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">Ultimately, IGAD decided to urgently convene a High Level Revitalisation Forum 
of the Parties to the Peace Agreement, including estranged groups, to discuss 
concrete measures to restore the permanent ceasefire, return to full and inclusive 
implementation of the Peace Agreement, and to develop a revised and realistic 
timeline and implementation schedule towards democratic elections at the end of 
the transition period.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">

</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">For the Revitalisation process to succeed and for effective implementation of the 
Peace Agreement to be achieved, there is need for demonstrable political will by 
the Parties and estranged groups to be inclusive and to accommodate one another 
politically, rather than attempt to defeat each other militarily.</a></p>

Overview 

3. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">In  this  reporting  period,  the  Joint  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Commission  JMEC 
convened two Plenaries, received regular briefings from the Transitional Government of 
National Unity (TGoNU), addressed an Extra-Ordinary Summit of the Intergovernmental 
Authority on Development (IGAD) Heads of State and Government on South Sudan, and 
two  IGAD  Council  of  Ministers  meetings,  and  considered  reports  from  the  different 
Peace Agreement institutions and mechanisms on its implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">JMEC is currently 
engaged in supporting the convening of the IGAD High Level Revitalisation Forum.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">

4.  </a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">At the March Plenary the decision was taken to establish six JMEC Working Committees, 
according to the Chapters of the Peace Agreement and to work in close consultation with 
the three TGoNU clusters -- Governance, Economy and Service Delivery.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">

</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">These thematic Working Committees meet regularly to carefully evaluate progress that 
has been made or lack thereof by the TGoNU and all Peace Agreement institutions and 
mechanisms in its implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">They also act as oversight platforms to provide advice 
and  recommend  remedial  action,  which  are  then  forwarded  to  the  JMEC Chairperson. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">During this reporting period, they have met a combined total of 24 times and had very 
constructive  deliberations  and  assessments,  which  will  constitute  invaluable  inputs 
toward the revitalisation process.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">

</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">Chapter I -- Transitional Government and National Unity 

</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">Some modest progress has been made by the current TGoNU in the implementation of 
the Chapter but there are several provisions yet to be implemented.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">The post of the Deputy 
Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  International  Cooperation  allocated  to  the  Former 
Detainees (FDs) that had fallen vacant remained unfilled during the reporting period.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">It 
is critical that the TGoNU fills this vacant position in accordance with the provisions of 
the Peace Agreement.</a></p>

<p><a id="109" name="109">The 25 percent quota for women participation in the Executive, Council of Ministers and 
as  Deputy  Ministers  has  not  been  met.  </a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">During  the  reporting  period  representation  of 
women  in  the  Council  of  Ministers  stood  at  20  percent  with  no  woman  appointed  as 
Deputy  Minister.  </a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">The  TGoNU  is  encouraged  to  consider  full  women  participation  as 
provided for in the Peace Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">

8.  </a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">During  the  last  quarter  it  was  reported  that  the  National  Constitutional  Amendment 
Committee (NCAC) had completed the drafting of the Constitutional Amendment Bill 
(2017).  </a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">Also  that  it  had  incorporated  provisions  of  the  Peace  Agreement  into  the 
Transitional  Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan  (TCRSS)  2011,  which  was 
presented as the Draft Constitutional Amendment Bill (DCAB) 2017 to the Ministry of 
Justice and Constitutional Affairs (MoJCA) on April 13th 2017, and that the Minister had 
prepared a memo for presenting the draft Bill to the TGoNU Council of Ministers.</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">

9. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">The Peace Agreement provides that the Draft Bill should be submitted to the Council of 
Ministers and Parliament within seven days of its receipt from the NCAC.</a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">However, four 
months  later,  it  remains  stuck  with  the  Minister  of  Justice  without  explanation.  </a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">The 
delayed completion of the Constitutional Amendment process inevitable impacts on other 
processes  directly  and  indirectly,  for  example  the  initiation  of  the  Permanent 
Constitution-making process.</a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">10.  </a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">The  NCAC  has  made  commendable  progress  in  the  review  and  amendment  of  key 
National Security related legislation as required by the Peace Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">The Committee 
held  an  interdisciplinary  meeting  of  experts  on  defence,  national  security,  police,  and 
wildlife to  map out  the scope of  amendments and reforms to  the SPLA  Act  2009, the 
National  Security  Act  (2014),  the  Police  Service  Act  (2009),  the  Prison  Service  Act 
(2011), and the Wildlife Service Act (2011).  </a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">The NCAC  also  conducted consultations 
with different line ministries and stakeholders including women groups and civil society 
organisations.  

11.  </a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">To fast-track its work, the NCAC established two sub-committees –one on defence laws 
and another on policing laws.</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">Both NCAC sub-committees have finished the first reading 
of the relevant security and policing laws under their dockets.</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">The sub-committees await 
further suggestions for amendments from key stakeholders.  

12.  </a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">The NCAC is further required under Chapter I, Article 16 to review the Political Parties 
Act  (PPA)  2012  and  the  National  Elections  Act  2012.  </a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">The  PPA  is  to  be  reviewed  to 
comply with international best practices for free and democratic registration of political 
parties in South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="129" name="129">

13.  </a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">The Political Parties Council (PPC) and the National Election Commission (NEC) were 
required to be reconstituted within eight months into the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">During the 
reporting period no significant progress had been made in this direction, both in terms of 
legislative amendment and institutional reforms.</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">

14.  </a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">The NCAC held preliminary consultations with both the PPC and the NEC.</a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">A governance 
experts’ meeting is scheduled during August 2017 to assess the scope of the issues for 
consideration in the amendment process of both pieces of legislation.</a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="136" name="136">15.  </a></p>
<p><a id="137" name="137">Pending  tasks  include  finalization  of  the  amendments  of  the  relevant  security  and 
governance related legislation for presentation to the TGoNU Council of Ministers, their 
ratification  by  the  Transitional  National  Legislature  (TNLA)  and  signing  by  the 
President.  </a></p>
<p><a id="138" name="138">Also  pending  is  the  reconstitution  of  several  transitional  institutions  and 
mechanisms,  including  the  PPC  and  NEC,  which  are  critical  for  paving  a  way  for 
registration of political parties, and preparation and conduct of elections at the end of the 
Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="139" name="139">These are all tasks that will require a considerable amount of time 
and resources to be credible.</a></p>

Chapter II - Permanent Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements 

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="141" name="141">

</a></p>
<p><a id="142" name="142">In spite of the unilateral declaration of a ceasefire by H.E President Salva Kiir Mayardit, 
fighting  between  government  and  opposition  forces  continued  in  different  parts  of  the 
country.  </a></p>
<p><a id="143" name="143">There  were  reports  of  continuing  and  increasing  incidents  of  targeted  and 
retaliatory  violence  committed  by  uniformed  forces  as  well  as  Other  Armed  Groups 
(OAGs).  </a></p>
<p><a id="144" name="144">The  main  highways  and  commercial  transit  arteries  remain  highly  dangerous 
due to the large number of robberies, ambushes and physical assaults including killings.</a></p>
<p><a id="145" name="145">

</a></p>
<p><a id="146" name="146">Ceasefire Violations 
17.  </a></p>
<p><a id="147" name="147">Verification  of  violations  of  the  ceasefire  remains  complicated  and  sometimes 
ambiguous.</a></p>
<p><a id="148" name="148">The division of the SPLA-IO into two factions confuses the identification of 
forces in the field, and complicates the Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements 
Monitoring  Mechanism  (CTSAMM)  investigations  due  to  the  absence  of  SPLA-IO 
(Machar) liaison officers in the CTSAMM Monitoring and Verification Teams (MVTs). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="149" name="149">Without  formal  liaison  between  CTSAMM  MVTs  and  OAGs  field  commanders, 
CTSAMM  cannot  verify  incidents,  investigate  and  accurately  report  on  violations  by 
SPLA-IO  (Machar)  and  OAGs  due  to  lack  of  access  into  their  controlled  areas. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="150" name="150">Consequently, more violations are reported in Government controlled areas, which are 
more accessible to MVTs, than in SPLA-IO (Machar) and areas controlled by OAGs.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="151" name="151">18.  </a></p>
<p><a id="152" name="152">The proliferation of OAGs and non-signatories to the Agreement, which do not fall under 
CTSAMM’s  verification  and  investigation  operations  mandate,  also  confuse  the  data 
especially  when  they  engage,  or  are  engaged  by,  </a></p>
<p><a id="153" name="153">the  SPLA-IG.  None  of  the  violation 
reports issued by JMEC to both the SPLM and SPLM–IO authorities have been answered. 
</a></p>

<p><a id="276" name="276">During the first six months of 2017 the authorities initiated a marked reduction in their

Economic Outlook 
48.  </a></p>
<p><a id="294" name="294">An urgent resolution to the conflict in South Sudan is necessary in order to strengthen 
and consolidate economic stability while beginning the huge task of creating conditions 
for broader economic growth and development.</a></p>
<p><a id="295" name="295">This will necessarily include increasing 
agricultural production, improving oil and other revenue sources, encouraging growth in 
the rest of the private sector and developing the services sector.</a></p>
<p><a id="296" name="296">The unwinding of the oil 
price  subsidy  will  have  an  immediate  and  profound  impact  on  government  operations 
freeing up valuable resources to be used to meet its more pressing commitments.  

49.  </a></p>
<p><a id="297" name="297">Ongoing  efforts  by  TGoNU  to  improve  and  streamline  expenditure  management, 
eliminate the fuel subsidy, consolidate and reduce domestic arrears, establish the NRA, 
enact  appropriate legislation,  and limit  borrowing from  the Central  Bank can have the 
impact of further improving economic stability and setting the stage for future growth. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="298" name="298">Together with the unveiling of the National Development Strategy and efforts to increase 
oil production it will be better placed to secure future gains once the conflict ends.</a></p>
<p><a id="299" name="299">

50.  </a></p>

<p><a id="369" name="369">For the Revitalisation process to succeed and for effective implementation of the Peace 
Agreement to be achieved, there is need for demonstrable political will by the Parties and 
estranged groups to be inclusive and to accommodate one another politically, rather than 
attempt to defeat each other militarily.</a></p>
<p><a id="370" name="370">

65.

<p><a id="377" name="377">The  holding  of  credible  national  elections  as  provided  for  in  the  Peace

<p><a id="388" name="388">In  the  meantime,  TGoNU 
should  implement  measures  to  protect  witnesses  and  victims  during  the  preparatory

<p><a id="395" name="395">August 2017 marked the two-year anniversary of the signing of the Agreement on the 
Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="396" name="396">At the time it was hoped that 
the  signing  would  end  a  tragic  internal  conflict  that  had  threatened  to  tear  Africa’s 
youngest nation apart, and usher in a new period of hope for its people.</a></p>
<p><a id="397" name="397">Importantly it 
was  envisaged  that  the  signing  would  resolve  disagreements  amongst  the  Parties  over 
substantive issues, which appeared to divide them.</a></p>
<p><a id="398" name="398">

71.  </a></p>
<p><a id="399" name="399">Regrettably this hoped for peace has not materialised and today it appears that the country 
is as far away from achieving this peace as it was two years ago.</a></p>
<p><a id="400" name="400">JMEC has remained 
profoundly  shocked  by  the  rampant  hostilities  across  the  country  and  the  rapid 
deterioration  of  the  political,  security,  humanitarian  and  economic  situation  in  South 
Sudan.  

72. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="401" name="401">It  is  our  hope  that  the  IGAD  led  HLRF  will  once  again  restore  and  revitalise  the 
prominence of the Peace Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="402" name="402">The country can ill afford to continue on the current 
path.</a></p>
<p><a id="403" name="403">It will take the combined will of the Parties and all stakeholders with the support of 
the international community to restore peace and stability in the Republic of South Sudan.</a></p>
