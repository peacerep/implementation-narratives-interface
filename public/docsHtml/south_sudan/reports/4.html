Executive Summary 

</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">This Report of the Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (RJMEC) on 
the status of implementation of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in 
the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) covers the period from 1st April to 30th June 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">It 
highlights the prevailing political, security, humanitarian, and economic situation in the country 
and  pays  close  attention  to  the  progress  being  made  by  the  Agreement  institutions  and 
mechanisms to implement their mandate as envisaged during the Pre-Transitional Period. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">In addition,  the Report highlights  the activities undertaken by the agreement  institutions and 
implementation mechanisms, which are charged with implementing the Pre-Transitional Period 
tasks outlined in  the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">Further, it details  the engagement of the RJMEC leadership 
with the Parties, stakeholders and adherents, and guarantors of the R-ARCSS, the international 
community, and other interested institutions.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Finally, it makes some key observations and offers 
recommendations for remedial action to ensure effective implementation of the Agreement. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">The political and security situation in the Republic of South Sudan remains generally favourable 
to  the  successful  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">This  is  underpinned  by  the  continued 
observance of the Permanent Ceasefire and an absence of armed conflict between the Parties. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">Where there were heightened tensions, they were in the context of longstanding intercommunal 
differences often manifested in violent cattle rustling incidents.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">For the three-month reporting 
period, there were no additional reports of investigated and verified Sexual and Gender Based 
Violence (SGBV), even as the authorities stepped up efforts to address the problem.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56"> 

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Humanitarian access to the population greatly improved as aid agencies continued to provide 
for close to seven (7) million South Sudanese residents, who are considered to be food insecure. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">The number of displaced persons remained at an estimated 4 million of which 1.9 million are 
within South Sudan and the remainder in the neighbouring countries of Sudan, Kenya, Ethiopia, 
Uganda  and  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo.  </a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Owing  to  the  generally  improved  security 
situation, a small number of the internally displaced started to voluntarily return to their homes.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">During the reporting period, the process of reconstituting the Disarmament Demobilization and 
Reintegration  (DDR)  Commission  got  underway.  </a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">Also,  the  Independent  Boundaries 
Commission (IBC) concluded their work but did not reach consensus on its mandate to consider 
the number of States of  the Republic of South  Sudan, their boundaries, the composition  and 
restructuring  of  the  Council  of  States.  </a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">In  view  of  the  unfinished  Pre-Transitional  tasks, 
particularly as it relates to cantonment, the Parties agreed to extend the Pre-Transitional Period 
by six months to 11th November 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">This decision was also ratified by the IGAD Council of 
Ministers.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">In view of the unimplemented R-ARCSS activities of the Pre-Transitional Period, particularly 
cantonment, training and unification of forces, the Parties agreed in their meeting held in Addis 
Ababa, Ethiopia, from 2nd – 3rd May 2019, to extend the Pre-Transitional Period by six months 
to  11th  November  2019  to  enable  them  to  expedite  the  implementation.  </a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">This  decision  was 
welcomed and endorsed by the IGAD Council of Ministers at its 67th Extra-ordinary Session of 
7th May 2019, held in Juba South Sudan.</a></p>

the 
implementation schedules of the activities of the Pre-Transitional Period accordingly.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">A number 
of identified sites were verified as suitable for cantonment of forces whereas a few others were 
not deemed suitable.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">That notwithstanding, operationalization of cantonment of forces and 

institutions  and  mechanisms  revised 

 

  
 ii 

selection and training of the Necessary Unified Forces (NUFs) did not commence due to delayed 
disbursement  of  funds  to  the  transitional  security  mechanisms  and  provision  of  the  requisite 
logistics (provision of food, water and medicines) to the sites.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">More so, some elements of the 
armed forces  continued to  occupy some civilian  centres notwithstanding  the orders  from  the 
Joint Defence Board (JDB) to them to vacate them by the 15th June 2019 deadline.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">The  National  Pre-Transitional  Committee  (NPTC)  continues  to  play  a  critical  role  in 
coordinating the implementation of the activities of the Pre-Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">A key aspect 
of  that  responsibility  is  the  sourcing  of  requisite  funding  for  the  security  implementing 
mechanisms.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">In that regard, the NPTC after receiving US $10 million from the ITGoNU made 
available  US  $2  million  to  the  JDB  to  facilitate  the  various  mechanisms  to  enable  them  to 
expedite the process of cantonment. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">The  National  Constitutional  Amendment  Committee  completed  the  review  of  the  national 
security  laws,  which  was  started  in  the  previous  quarter.  </a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">These  were  the  National  Security 
Service Act  2014 (Amendment) Bill,  2019 and the Political  Parties Act,  2012 (Amendment) 
Bill 2019, which were presented to the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">

 

The  transitional  security  mechanisms  led  by  the  JDB  continued  to  prepare  for  cantonment, 
selection  and  training  of  the  NUFs.  </a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">With  the  support  of  RJMEC,  the  security  mechanisms 
engaged in strengthening their technical capacities through a series of workshops.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">Besides, the 
Joint  Military  Ceasefire  Committee  (JMCC)  completed  the  training  of  Area  Joint  Military 
Ceasefire Committees (AJMCCs) and Joint Military Ceasefire (JMC) teams, in preparation for 
cantonment.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">The Joint Transitional Security Committee (JTSC) also completed the syllabus for 
the training of all the organized forces of the NUF except National Security Services.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">To support wide dissemination of the R-ARCSS, the RJMEC completed the work it began in 
the  previous  quarter,  including  printing  and  distribution  of  summaries  of  the  R-ARCSS  in 
English  and  classical  Arabic.  </a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">Audio  recordings  of  public  service  announcements  in  English, 
Juba  Arabic,  Dinka,  Nuer,  Bari,  Zande  and  Collo  (Shilluk)  have  been  aired  out  in  various 
electronic media outlets.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">Furthermore, RJMEC continued to distribute to the public thousands 
of reprinted copies of the R-ARCSS. 
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">Important Pre-Transitional Period tasks that were started previously and continue apace include 
dissemination  of  the  R-ARCSS,  delivery  of  humanitarian  assistance,  release  of  political 
prisoners and detainees, and disengagement of forces, and the beginning of a process of national 
healing and reconciliation.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">However, key pending tasks include:</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">(</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">i) cantonment and training of 
unified  forces;</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90"> </a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">(ii)  reconstituting  of  the  DDR  Commission;</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92"> </a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">and  (iii)  the  appointment  of  an 
RJMEC Chairperson. 

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">In order to fully operationalise the cantonment within the remaining Pre-Transitional Period, it 
is important that the authorities avail the necessary resources to the mechanisms, which have 
shown their readiness to carry out the tasks.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">Besides, regional countries and the African Union 
High Level Ad-hoc Committee on South Sudan (C5) should make good on their promises to 
avail  support  to  the  cantonment  process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">The  former  combatants  also  demonstrated  their 
readiness  to  report  to  the  cantonment  sites  and  those  efforts  should  be  encouraged  and 
supported.

I. Introduction 

1.  </a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">This Report is prepared pursuant to Chapter VII, Article 7.9 of the Revitalised Agreement on 
the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) and covers the period 
1st April to 30th June 2019.  </a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">During the second quarter of 2019, the Parties to the Agreement 
agreed to extend the Pre-Transitional Period by a further six months to 11th November 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">A 
decision subsequently endorsed by the IGAD Council of Ministers.  
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">2.  </a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">Very  little  progress  was  made  in  accomplishing  the  Pre-Transitional  tasks,  which  were 
identified  as  either  pending  or  ongoing  at  the  end  of  the  first  quarter.  </a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">Of  the  fifty-nine  (59) 
activities outlined in the Agreement to be performed during the Pre-Transitional Period, 27 are 
considered to  be completed, 17 are ongoing and  15 are still pending.  </a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">In particular,  activities 
related  to  the  cantonment  and  training  of  a  unified  army  all  but  stalled  and  the  Independent 
Boundaries Commission (IBC) completed its Report without a conclusive recommendation on 
the number of states of South Sudan, their boundaries, and the restructuring of the Council of 
States.  </a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">A  process  was  embarked  upon  to  reconstitute  the  Disarmament  Demobilization  and 
Reintegration (DDR) Commission, but this is yet to be concluded.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">

 

3.  </a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">Notwithstanding  the  slow  pace  of  implementation  of  the  outstanding  activities  of  the  Pre-
Transitional Period, the general political and security situation remained relatively stable and 
the Permanent Ceasefire continued to hold throughout South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">However, serious clashes 
related to  cattle rustling  continued around Twic,  mainly  between  Bul  Nuer and Twic Dinka. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">Tensions which were previously observed in the Yei River area where fighting previously took 
place between forces allied to General Thomas Cirillo of the National Salvation Front (NAS) 
and  those  of  the  South  Sudanese  Peoples’  Defence  Forces  (SSPDF)  and  the  Sudan  Peoples' 
Liberation Army - In Opposition (SPLA-IO);</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">largely subsided.</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">   

 

4.  In the meantime, while the transitional security mechanisms awaited financial support from the 
National  Pre-Transitional  Committee  (NPTC),  they  focused  on  developing  their  technical 
capacity  and  laying  the  groundwork  for  cantonment  with  technical  support  from  the 
Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (RJMEC) Secretariat.</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">RJMEC also 
continued to disseminate the R-ARCSS and made hard copies of the Agreement more accessible 
to the public.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">This was accomplished by translating summaries of the R-ARCSS into several 
local languages both in  print and in  audio segments, which are being aired  out on electronic 
media outlets throughout the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">

 

5.  Section II of the Report which follows highlights the prevailing political, security, humanitarian 
and  economic  situation  in  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan.  </a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">Section  III  focuses  on  the  status  of 
implementation of the Pre-Transitional tasks while Section IV offers updates on the activities 
of  the  Agreement  institutions  and  implementation  mechanisms,  and  Section  V  highlights 
RJMEC’s engagements in enhancing its mandate of monitoring and evaluation.  </a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">Finally, Section 
VI presents observations and recommendations, all of which are augmented by a detailed list 
and update of the activities pursued since the signing of the R-ARCSS, in Annex A.

Political and Security 

6.  </a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">The prevailing political situation in South Sudan during the second quarter of 2019 continued 
to be calm and stable, without any serious disruption.</a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">For the most part of the quarter, the work 
of  the  various  Agreement  institutions  and  implementation  mechanisms  continued  apace.</a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">
</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">Concerning the security  situation, the Permanent  Ceasefire continued to  hold  throughout  the 
country.</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">However, serious incidents of clashes were reported around the centuries’ old practice 
of cattle rustling, linked to inter-communal rivalries, which left scores dead.</a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">The incidents were 
confined mainly to the area around Twic, with clashes between Bul Nuer and Twic Dinka.</a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">There 
was one reported incident of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) for the period under 
review  and  is  being  investigated  by  the  Ceasefire  Transitional  Security  Arrangement 
Monitoring and Verification Mechanism (CTSAMVM).</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125"> 
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">Humanitarian Situation 

7.  </a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">According to the UN and Partners’ Humanitarian Response Plan for 2019, the number of people 
in need of humanitarian assistance increased marginally to approximately 7.2 million, compared 
to 7.1 million in the previous quarter.</a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">At the same time, data from the Integrated Food Security 
Phase Classification (IPC)1, an estimated 6.96 million people could face acute food insecurity 
by the end of July 2019, the highest level ever estimated.</a></p>
<p><a id="129" name="129">This presented an increase of more 
than  400,000  compared  to  the  estimates  at  the  end  of  the  first  quarter.  </a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">Furthermore,  it  was 
estimated that 1.82 million people would be a step away from catastrophic food insecurity while 
more than 5 million would face crisis levels of food insecurity. 
 

8.  </a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">With respect to the number of displaced persons, data from the UN Office for the Coordination 
of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) showed that there were approximately four million people or 
roughly the same level with that cited at the end of the first quarter of 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">Of this number, 1.9 
million persons were estimated to be internally displaced (IDPs) and the remainder were refugee 
communities  living  in  the  neighbouring  countries  of  Kenya,  Uganda,  Ethiopia,  Democratic 
Republic of Congo, and Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">Importantly, the improved general security situation throughout 
the  country  encouraged  voluntary  return  of  some  internally  displaced  persons  (IDPs).  </a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">For 
instance, on May 3, 324 IDPs mainly women and children returned from Melut to their places 
of origin in Baliet County in the Greater Upper Nile area.</a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">UNMISS also facilitated two groups 
of IDPs, totalling 98 persons relocated from the Juba Protection of Civilian (PoC) site to the 
Greater  Uror  area.  </a></p>
<p><a id="136" name="136">Cumulatively,  it  was  estimated  that  over  15,000  people  had  left  the  PoC 
camps to return home since at least January of 2019.  

 

9.  </a></p>
<p><a id="137" name="137">Notwithstanding  this  encouraging  development,  the  United  Nations  High  Commission  for 
Refugees (UNHCR) warned that the current conditions were not yet conducive for large scale, 
durable, safe and dignified returns of the IDPs.</a></p>

<p><a id="153" name="153">This  coupled  with  the

<p><a id="159" name="159">Part of this was on account of 
the higher oil prices but also due to the fact that the government for the first time sold their oil 
directly  on  the  open  market  rather  than  through  complicated  forward  sales.  </a></p>

response, the Interim Chairperson observed that for purposes of verification of troop numbers 
CTASAMVM  should  give  prior  notice,  however,  this  would  not  apply  if  they  were  in  the 
process  of  investigating  alleged  violations  of  the  permanent  ceasefire.  </a></p>

8th April 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="416" name="416">The Interim Chairperson briefed the President on the status of implementation 
of  the  Revitalized  Peace  Agreement’s  Pre-Transitional  period  tasks,  ongoing  activities  and 
those activities yet to commence and consequential to the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="417" name="417">Specifically, the 
attention of the incumbent Government was drawn to the urgent and critical outstanding tasks 
of the pre-transitional period which required to be expedited, including cantonment, unification 
and training of forces (including those to be designated for VIP mandate), reconstitution of the 
DDR Commission, conclusion of mandate of the IBC.

<p><a id="419" name="419">They got a chance to see first-hand 
the intended cantonment site in Panyume and observed the presence of IO forces that had shown 
up at the camp, which was not sufficiently set up to receive them.</a></p>

<p><a id="421" name="421">The  RJMEC  leadership  met  with  a  visiting  delegation  from  the  office  of  the  UN  High 
Commissioner for Refugees.</a></p>
<p><a id="422" name="422">Issues discussed revolved around the current state of the refugees 
in the neighbouring countries and the displaced persons internally.</a></p>
<p><a id="423" name="423">It was confirmed that to date

there is no large-scale voluntary repatriation taking place.</a></p>
<p><a id="424" name="424">For the most part, the refugees are 
still  wary  of  the  security  situation  in  the  country.  </a></p>
<p><a id="425" name="425">The  UNHCR  will  not  ask  for  voluntary 
repatriation at this time nor will it promote, facilitate or organize this activity.</a></p>
<p><a id="426" name="426">It will, however, 
provide the necessary support for those choosing to return home.</a></p>
<p><a id="427" name="427">Also, of note, was the fact that 
there are no new refugees coming out of South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="428" name="428">The last time refugees entered the refugee

Henry Odwar in a bid to resolve several issues.</a></p>
<p><a id="432" name="432">These discussions revolved around the SPLM-
IO’s nomination to the DDR Commission and on the overall status of implementation of the R-
ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="433" name="433">This is part of a larger effort to proactively engage all the parties to the agreement on 
a bilateral basis to address issues as they arise.</a></p>
<p><a id="434" name="434">Since the meeting, the SPLM-IO submitted two 
nominees to meet with the other Parties to the Agreement in order to discuss the modalities to

</a></p>
<p><a id="439" name="439">VI.   </a></p>
<p><a id="440" name="440">Observations and Recommendations  

57.</a></p>
<p><a id="441" name="441">In just over six weeks following the extension of the Pre-Transitional Period, very little progress 
has been made in completing or even starting the core tasks of cantonment and the training of 
the NUF, which many view as essential to having a smooth transition to the formation of the 
RTGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="442" name="442">The delay in implementation was considered to be as a result of the failure of the 
ITGoNU to make good on its pledge to release US $100 million to support the Pre-Transitional 
activities.  </a></p>
<p><a id="443" name="443">Another  setback  has  been  the  inability  of  the  IBC  to  reach  consensus  in  order  to 
resolve  the  issue  of  the  number  of  states  and  their  boundaries  and  on  the  formation  of  the 
Council of States. 
 

58.</a></p>
<p><a id="444" name="444">Additionally,  there  was  only  limited  progress  on  the  vacating  of  all  civilian  centers  as  some 
continue to be occupied by the former combatants.</a></p>
<p><a id="445" name="445">More encouraging is the fact that there were 
only a few additional reports of SGBV and no violations of the permanent ceasefire.</a></p>
<p><a id="446" name="446">Periods of 
unrest  and  conflict  were  all  related  to  communal  differences  played  out  amidst  incidents  of 
cattle rustling.</a></p>
<p><a id="447" name="447">The overall improvement in security is also encouraging the voluntary return of 
some IDPs to their homes. 

 

59.</a></p>
<p><a id="448" name="448">Important Pre-Transitional Period tasks that were started previously and continue apace include 
dissemination  of  the  R-ARCSS,  delivery  of  humanitarian  assistance,  release  of  political 
prisoners and detainees, and disengagement of forces, and the beginning of a process of national 
healing and reconciliation.</a></p>
<p><a id="449" name="449">However, key pending tasks include:</a></p>
<p><a id="450" name="450">(</a></p>
<p><a id="451" name="451">i) cantonment and training of 
Necessary Unified Forces (ii) reconstituting of the DDR Commission;</a></p>
<p><a id="452" name="452">and (iii) the appointment 
of an RJMEC Chairperson.</a></p>
<p><a id="453" name="453">

 

 

  
 14 

60.</a></p>
<p><a id="454" name="454">In  order  to  fully  engage  the  cantonment  process  within  the  time  left,  it  is  important  that  the 
authorities  avail  the  necessary  resources  to  the  mechanisms,  which  have  demonstrated  their 
readiness to carry out the task.</a></p>
<p><a id="455" name="455">At the same time, regional countries and the AU C5 should make 
good on their promises and avail support to the cantonment process.</a></p>
<p><a id="456" name="456">The former combatants are 
also demonstrating their readiness to report to the cantonment sites and those efforts should be 
encouraged and supported.   

 

61.</a></p>
<p><a id="457" name="457">Given the inherent  difficulties and serious hurdles that would be in the way of resolving the 
issue of the number of states and their  boundaries, as well as the council of states through a 
referendum, it is important that the leadership of the Parties pursue a political solution.</a></p>
<p><a id="458" name="458">To that 
end, RJMEC supports the high level diplomatic initiative being undertaken by the IGAD Special 
Envoy to get agreement on this issue from the Parties. 

 

62.</a></p>
<p><a id="459" name="459">RJMEC  reiterates  its  recommendation  that  political  leaders  need  to  adopt  a  unified  and 
coordinated awareness campaign with respect to promotion and dissemination of the R-ARCSS. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="460" name="460">This will undoubtedly send a strong message of unity and progress on peace to the people of 
South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="461" name="461">It will also demonstrate their continued commitment to the implementation of the 
R-ARCSS in letter and spirit.</a></p>
<p><a id="462" name="462"> 

               VII.</a></p>
<p><a id="463" name="463">Conclusion 

63.</a></p>
<p><a id="464" name="464">The critical issues of agreement on the number of states and attempts to canton and train forces 
once again take centre stage as the 12th November deadline for the formation of the R-TGoNU 
looms.  </a></p>
<p><a id="465" name="465">Without  stated  political  will  and  the  availing  of  resources,  these  two  important 
milestones are in danger of not being realised.</a></p>
<p><a id="466" name="466">However, there is sufficient time remaining that 
if these two matters, in particular, are urgently dealt with as set out in the section above, then 
the country will be well-positioned to witness the formation of the R-TGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="467" name="467">Importantly, the 
cantonment process will be aided by the seeming willingness of the former combatants to follow 
orders and report to the cantonment sites.  
 

64.</a></p>
<p><a id="468" name="468">While  there  was  a  marked  slow-down  in  implementation  during  the  reporting  period  the 
continued  upholding  of  the  permanent  ceasefire,  signs  of  improvement  in  the  economy,  the 
beginning  of  voluntary  return  home  of  IDPs,  and  commitment  expressed  by  the  Parties  to 
address the prevalence of SGBV are all worthy of note.</a></p>
<p><a id="469" name="469">It demonstrates that a heightened pace 
of implementation can only further assist in moving the country along an irreversible path to 
lasting peace.</a></p>
<p><a id="470" name="470">  

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="471" name="471">65.</a></p>
<p><a id="472" name="472">RJMEC on its part shall continue to impartially monitor, evaluate and report as it carries out its 
oversight  responsibilities  with  regards  to  the  R-ARCSS,  and  make  interventions  when 
necessary.  </a></p>
<p><a id="473" name="473">It  will  also  continue  regular  reporting  in  writing  to  the  incumbent  TGoNU,  the

<p><a id="802" name="802">From  the  Implementation  Matrix  as  provided  by  the  R-ARCSS,  a  series  of  important  tasks  were 
required  to  be  implemented  during  the  eight  (8)  months  Pre-Transitional  Period.  </a></p>
<p><a id="803" name="803">The  above  table 
summarises fifty-nine (59) key activities which were to be implemented.</a></p>
<p><a id="804" name="804"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="805" name="805">The above tasks were categorised into three broad categories and assessed to determine their current 
status of implementation i.e. completed, pending or ongoing.</a></p>

<p><a id="810" name="810">Pending tasks denote where no action has been taken and no result is available.  
  Ongoing denote some process has begun or partially undertaken but further actions are 

required in order to deliver the expected results or ensure full compliance.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="811" name="811">Observations  

From the above table, 27 out of 59 tasks have been completed.</a></p>
<p><a id="812" name="812">This represents approximately 46% of 
the  overall  tasks.  </a></p>
<p><a id="813" name="813">Seventeen  (17)  out  of  59  have  started  but  still  ongoing  with  different  levels  and 
timelines to expected completion.</a></p>
<p><a id="814" name="814">This accounts for approximately 29%.</a></p>
<p><a id="815" name="815">Fifteen (15) out of 59 tasks 
are yet to begin or be undertaken representing 25% of the required tasks.</a></p>
<p><a id="816" name="816">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="817" name="817">However,  the  few  unimplemented  tasks  are  very  critical  for  the  formation  of  the  RTGoNU  and 
effective implementation of the R-ARCSS going forward.</a></p>
<p><a id="818" name="818">The completed tasks relate largely to the 
establishment or reconstitution of institutions and mechanisms of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="819" name="819">Even though these 
have been established or reconstituted accordingly, their functionality has been a big challenge.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="820" name="820">Most  of  the  institutions  and  mechanisms  have  not  been  able  to  implement  their  assigned  tasks 
effectively due to resource constraints and other impediments.</a></p>
<p><a id="821" name="821">These gaps have serious ramifications 
for the transition from Pre-Transitional Period into the Transitional Period.

Some  of  the  tasks,  including  the  unification  of  forces  and  determination  of  number  of  States  and 
boundaries issues by IBC are critical for the formation of the RTGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="822" name="822">Lack of coordination and 
evidence of close cooperation amongst the key principles at the highest level continue to cast doubts 
and undermine confidence in the peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="823" name="823">

</a></p>
<p><a id="824" name="824">There has been inadequate support from partners to the NPTC which partly accounts for the lagging 
behind.</a></p>
<p><a id="825" name="825">The Pre-Transitional Period tasks were expected to be funded by the incumbent TGoNU with 
support  of  international  partners.  </a></p>
<p><a id="826" name="826">Even  though  some  support  has  been  provided,  the  partners’ 
contribution has generally not been forth coming.</a></p>
<p><a id="827" name="827">There is need to match words with action if the R-
ARCSS is to be fully implemented.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="828" name="828">Conclusion  
With  the  Pre-Transitional  Period  extended  to  11th  November  2019,  every  effort  must  be  made  to 
complete the ongoing tasks and put in place those that are pending.</a></p>
<p><a id="829" name="829">This is particularly important for 
the task of cantonment and the training of the Necessary Unified Forces and the reconstituting of the 
DDR Commission.</a></p>
