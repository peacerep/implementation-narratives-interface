FIGHTING IN ABUROC
Executive Summary

On 12 September 2017 ABUROC in Upper Nile State changed hands following fighting
on the 11".</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">The SPLA-IO (RM) forces under Lt Gen Onony who controlled ABUROC
were ejected by troops from KODOK.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">This incident constitutes a violation of the PCTSA.
</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">ABUROK is in what is known as Fashoda State and has an IDP camp which is full
mainly of IDPs who fed WAU SHILLUK when that was taken by the SPLA earlier in the
year.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">The fighting resulted in the relocation of humanitarian staff and displacement of
IDP’s.
</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">The situation in this part of Upper Nile State is complex.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">Some troops from Lt Gen
Onony’s SPLA-IO (RM) changed allegiance to the SPLA-IO (TD), and it was these
forces which took ABUROC.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">A visit to ABUROC by Malakal MVT in early October in
order-to investigate the fighting confirmed that SPLA-IO (TD) forces control ABUROC,
and after much discussion at the CTSAMM member's meetings of 24 and 30 October
2017 it is the clear opinion of CTSAMM that by taking ABUROC by force SPLA-IO (TD)
forces were in clear violation of the PCTSA.

1.0  Introduction

1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">

</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">•</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">The situation in the Shilluk areas north of Malakal is complex.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">This year has
seen mass displacement resulting from SPLA offensive operations, and many
of the remaining civilians are in IDP camps dependent on humanitarian aid.

</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">•</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">The conflict has been between the SPLA and the forces of Lt Gen Johnson
Olony which remain loyal to Riek Machar.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">However, in recent months the
dynamic has changed with some of Lt Gen Onony’s forces changing their
allegiance to SPLA-IO (TD).

</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">-•</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">On  September 2017 it was reported the barrack area of the SPLA-IO (RM)
at in Adout Nyiworo village (which is east of ABUROC) was attacked.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">The
attack was repulsed, and the attackers returned to KODOK from whence they
came.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">On 11 September 2017 the same forces attacked again.

1.2.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">The aim of the report is to describe what is known about the fighting around
ABUROC on -12 September 2017, and attribute responsibility for violations of
the PCTSA.

1.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">

</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">•</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">The. MVT based in Malakal were able to monitor events through established
contacts and sources, including information from the SPLA " Division
Headquarters in Malakal.

_®</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">On  October 2017 the MVT visited ABUROC where they were able to
interview a wide range of people including a senior officer claiming to be with

the SPLA-IO (TD), representatives from INGOs and UN agencies supporting
"the IDP camp and civilian IDPs.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">

2.0  Findings

2.1     ABUROC changed hands on 12 September 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">Following an unsuccessful
attack against SPLA-IO (RM) forces in Adout Nyiworo on  September the attack
was renewed on 11 September when the attacking forces took Adout Nyiworo
and the SPLA-IO (RM) forces of Johnson Olony withdrew to ATAR.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">On the
morning of 12 September the attacking forces reportedly shelled positions
around ABUROC to find that the SPLA-IO (RM) had gone, and ABUROC was
taken.

2.2  </a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">There were reports of victorious soldiers looting property as they returned to

~ KODOK.

2.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">The fighting resulted in 30-35 humanitarian staff being relocated, although they
were able to return soon after.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">A large number of IDPs were displaced by the
fighting:</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">there were about 20,000 before 11 September and when the CTSAMM
visited on  October there were about 11,500;</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">the others had fled.

2.4  </a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">The MVT found the situation in ABUROC IDP camp is calm but tense.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">Many
people fled during the fighting but have been returning.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">Some of the camp
accommodation is occupied by military forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">

2.5  </a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">There was some initial confusion as to whether the attacking forces included
SPLA elements.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">They reportedly came from KODOK which is held by the SPLA,
but a senior officer at ABUROC confirmed that it was SPLA-IO (TD) forces that

_ had taken and hold ABUROCH.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">Information suggests they were former SPLA-
 (RM) soldiers who had recently changed their allegiance to SPLA-IO (TD);</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">at
the CTSAMM member's meeting of 30 October 2017 the SPLA-IO (TD)

representative confirmed that this was the case and that the SPLA-IO (TD)
~ control ABUROC.

</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">

3.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">This is a complex incident.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">It concerns fighting between Shilluk SPLA-IO (RM)
forces under Lt Gen Olony and SPLA-IO (TD) forces recently defected from the
SPLA-IO (RM).</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">It has not been possible for the MVT to confirm whether or not
SPLA forces were directly or indirectly involved with the attack.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">Government
CTSAMM members deny any involvement.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">

3.2|ABUROC changed hands as the result of offensive military operations, from the
SPLA-IO (RM) to the SPLA-IO (TD) and this has to be seen as a clear breach of
the PCTSA whatever local political manoeuvrings were involved.

</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">4.0~°Conclusion:</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">It is concluded that SPLA-IO (TD) forces attacked and wrested
control of ABUROC from the SPLA-IO (RM), and in doing so cleatrly ciolated the
PCTSA, specifically:</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Article 1.0:</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">“The permanent Ceasefire shall apply to all forces of the
warring parties, armed groups and all other forces and militias allied to
either Party.....”

•</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">Article 1.1:</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">The warring parties shall refrain from prohibited actions
outlined in the COHA....”

5.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">

</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">5.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">Although the situation in and around ABUROC appears to have stabilised, the
attacks of -12 September resulted in yet more fear and displacement for the
civilian population.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">

5.2  Members of CTSAMM from both the Government and the SPLA-IO (TD) were
very helpful in providing information about the incident.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">The Government denied
any involvement, but the SPLA-IO (TD) stated clearly that their forces had taken
and now control ABUROC.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">

5.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">The focus of all parties should now be on the revitalisation of the peace process.
</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">CTSAMM calls on JMEC to condemn this and any other offensive operations
which could damage the peace process.</a></p>

cannot be enough to cover it.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">There is also presence of many rebel groups
operating in the area such as LRA and the rebel groups of the Central African
Republic and that is the reason for which the area hasexperienced a lot of
criminal activities.
