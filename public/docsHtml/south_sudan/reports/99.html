CTSAMM REPORT NUMBER 045
MONITORING REPORT EASTERN EQUATORIA STATE
Executive Summary
CTSAMM has continued to monitor the security situation in Eastern Equatoria closely,
with an emphasis on the area affected by SPLA-IG operations against SPLA-IO (RM)
in April when violations were committed against the local civilian population.</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">During
follow-up patrols by CTSAMM to Pageri, Pajok and surrounding areas from May to July
it was discovered that these abuses continue and many places remain depopulated as
those citizens who have fled are too afraid to return.
</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">CTSAMM found evidence of SPLA-IO (RM) forces in the area.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">There have been
allegations made suggesting that they have been responsible for ambushes and
abductions on SPLA-IG and civilians.
</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">The security situation in large parts of Eastern Equatoria remains poor with frequent
and violent ambushes on main roads.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">Both parties have been reported to be preparing
forces for armed clashes in the Imatong area.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">The tense and dangerous security
situation and fear of attacks and looting has caused tens of thousands of civilians
recently displaced to stay away from their home villages, and for some to travel to
refugee camps in Uganda.

<p><a id="14" name="14">MONITORING REPORT EASTERN EQUATORIA STATE

1.0  Introduction

1.1     Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">On  April 2017 Government Forces mounted an operation against SPLM/A-
 units in the Pajok area.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">This resulted in the deaths of at least 16 civilians,
extensive looting and the displacement of the majority of the population.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">This
was the subject of CTSAMM report number 038</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">which was presented at the
CTSAMM meeting of  May 2017.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The MVT continued to receive reports of violations involving the civilian
population in the south west of Eastern Equatorial State.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">In June there were been frequent and bloody ambushes on civilians, NGOs
and SPLM/A-IG convoys along main routes in Eastern Equatoria.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">The overall
security situation has deteriorated over the past three months.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">In accordance with a commitment made at the last CTSAMM meeting the
security situation in Pajok and other areas in Eastern Equatoria has been
continuously monitored by CTSAMM.

1.2  Incidents:</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">The MVT based in Torit has investigated multiple incidents which
occurred between May and July.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">These included Cessation of Hostilities
breaches, multiple incidents involving violations against civilians such as looting,
the displacement and attacking of civilians and occupation of schools by military
units.

1.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">Aim</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">:</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The purpose of this report is to describe the security situation in Eastern
Equatoria, identify alleged violations of the PCTSA and attribute responsibility
where appropriate.

1.4  Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">MVT Torit mounted two joint patrols with UNMISS on 15- 20 May 2017 and
20-23 June 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">The patrols visited Nimule, Magwi, Pajok, Owinkybul, Moli
Andro, Obbo, Palotaka and Labone.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">During the patrol members of the MVT were able to meet with a wide range
of people, including SPLA-IO (RM) defectors, ordinary citizens, leaders of
youth and other community groups and members of County, Payam and
Boma civil administrations and SPLA-IG officers.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">In addition to patrols the MVT also monitor the day-to-day situation in Eastern
Equatoria through SPLA-IG Liaison officers, Community Liaison Officers and
regular meetings with senior state officials and SPLA commanders in Torit.

2.0  Findings
2.1  Overall Security Assessment.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">The period May to July was characterised by high levels of violence in Eastern
Equatoria.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">There have been skirmishes between warring parties most
notably in the Imatong area.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">There has been extensive displacement of civilians who have chosen to flee
the violence in Pageri County and Pajok and move into a refugee camp at
Parabek across the border in Uganda.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">Since early June there have been frequent ambushes on major roads in
Eastern Equatoria which have caused heavy loss of life to civilians.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">In addition to a heavy SPLM/A-IG and SPLM/A-IO (RM) presence there are
active Unknown Armed Groups (UAGs) in Ayaci County who are reportedly
responsible for robberies and ambushes.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">In response to the security threat

the youth in Magwi and Awaci have been mobilised and have been observed
carrying weapons and operating alongside SPLA-IG soldiers.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">Recently reported movement of forces from both parties has resulted in a
poor security situation becoming even more tense and threatening.

2.2  Cessation of Hostilities.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">In Eastern Equatoria there are credible reports of defections of senior officers
and rank and file from SPLA-IO (RM) to SPLA-IG or SPLA-IO (TDG).</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">The
numbers involved and their status as combatants are not verified.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">The SPLA-IO (RM) have committed a number of violation most notably the
ambush of a NSS convoy on  June 2017 which resulted in both military and
civilian casualties.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">The recent movement of troops from both parties to establish positions in the
Imatong area indicate the possibility of renewed clashes.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">Despite the tense security situation in Pajok the Acholi community with
UNMISS assistance convened a Peace Conference in Pajok on 20-21 June
where elders from the community travelled from Ayaci, Magwi, Torit and Juba
and were able to meet.

2.3  Protection of Civilians.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">The theft, looting and destruction of properties carried out by SPLA-IG
soldiers in Pajok has continued.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">The MVT witnessed SPLA-IG soldiers taking
wheelbarrows of scrap from Pageri and that all the windows and doors had
been stripped from the primary school and clinic.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">The committee to deal with problems between the civilian community and
soldiers has been ineffective as evidenced by the fact that on the most recent
MVT patrol shops schools and houses in Pajok continue to be occupied by
SPLA-IG.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">Fighting on  April resulted in the displacement of at least ,000 people from
the Pajok area to Uganda within a period of  days.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">There is evidence that
civilians are returning to Pajok Payam but a recent registration exercise saw
civilians subsequently return to Uganda because of the destruction of
property and lack of food in their villages.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Most of the civilians remaining tend
to be elderly and/or disabled.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">Civilians remain vulnerable to ambush and abduction.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">On 15 May  civilians
were abducted and ransoms demanded by forces believed to be SPLA |O
(RM) in Ayaci County.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">Evidence collected by the MVT from local people indicated that displacement
from the Eastern Equatoria is driven not only by the actions of SPLA-IG but
also by the insecurity caused by the SPLA-(1O) RM and UAGs.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">Large numbers of SPLA-IG personnel, specifically Tiger Battalion and what
the MVT has been told are Mathiang Anyoor remain in Pageri and Ayaci
counties.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">There is no doubt that their presence deters the return of those who
have fled.

3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">

3.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">The recent escalation in violence in Eastern Equatoria has been caused by
increased activity by SPLA-IO (RM) and UAGs.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Consequently security is
threatened by frequent ambushes, the killing and abductions of civilians and
major disruption to civilian livelihoods by regular denial of access and road
closures.

3.2  Anational army should exist to protect its citizens.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">The SPLA-IG is committed to
protect civilians under the COHA and PCTSA.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">However, the actions of SPLA-IG
in Pageri and Ayaci counties continue to be in clear violation of these
agreements.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">The blatant looting of private and civil property displays a contempt
for the civilian population, who remain fearful of SPLA-IG personnel and are
unlikely to return whilst they remain iin the area.

3.3  The arming of youth groups in Ayaci County is likely to add to insecurity rather
encourage stability.

4.0  Conclusion

4.1_ Itis the opinion of CTSAMM that the SPLA-IO (RM) and UAGs are responsible
for many attacks on SPLA-IG and civilians, especially along major roads, in
Eastern Equatoria and in so doing violate Article 1.0.5  of the PCTSA and Article
 of the COHA.

4.0_ It is the opinion of CTSAMM that the actions of arming youth groups in Ayaci
County constitutes a violation by the state government of Article 1.0  of the
COHA and potentially Article 1.1.3  of the PCTSA if any of the youth are under
the age of 18.

4.0  It is the opinion of CTSAMM that the actions of SPLA-IG personnel in Eastern
Equatoria State against the civilian population continue to violate the PCTSA,
specifically Article 1.0.5.

5.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">

5.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">The recently convened Acholi Community Peace Conference is a welcome
development.

5.2  All parties should respect the ARCSS by maintaining a permanent ceasefire.

5.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">All parties should ensure the actions of their military forces do not result in
violations against civilians

5.4  Allparties should ensure that those who perpetrate violations are held to account.

5.5  All parties should contribute to the setting of conditions which will be conducive
to the safe return of the displaced civilian population of Eastern Equatoria.
