Assessment
12.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">The seizure of 3000 cattle and the killing and wounding of civilians in Nhialdhu on
11 January 2021 was conducted by armed youth from Koch County.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">The incident
triggered a sequence of further violent clashes.
13.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">State and county authorities tried to resolve the issues arising from the cattle raid
in a peaceful manner, Unfortunately, the attempts to negotiate failed in the face of
@ heavily armed response by the armed youth who, on the evidence provided to
CTSAMVM, appear to have been the chief protagonists.
</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">14.When Col Tholow Wich and his soldiers attempted to retrieve weapons from the
villages of Logat, Jajah and Jaak in Koch County on 20 February 2021 the soldiers
under his command destroyed houses, looted Property and destroyed an NGO
facility resulting in the displacement of civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">There are grounds for considering
that the violence was inflicted as a retaliation against the Koch community for the
casualties inflicted on SSPDF soldiers on  February 2021.
</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">15.SSPDF have accepted responsibility for the action carried out by soldiers under
the command of Col  Tholow Wich.  </a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">Furthermore, SSPDF have  reportedly
investigated the incidents  which took place on 20  February and the officer
responsible has been arrested and is in Juba awaiting court martial Procedures,
Conclusion
16.The effect of the destruction of houses and NGO facilities in Koch County by
SSPDF was to cause widespread civilian displacement in violation of Article 2.0.10 
of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">SSPDF has failed to fulfil its Obligations to protect civilians as                            |

<p><a id="108" name="108">Observations and Recommendations
17.</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">The SSPDF response in arresting and investigating the actions of Col Tholow Wich
is welcome and clearly demonstrates a willingness to accept responsibility for the
regrettable events of 20 February 2021,
18.The attempts made by the State and County Officials and SSPDF to achieve a
Negotiated resolution to the problems caused by the cattle raid of 14 January 2021
are to be commended and in future related incidents should continue.
19.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">The violence in Koch county is likely to recur because of the prevalence of weapons
held by armed youth, Unfortunately, the attempts to retrieve weapons resulted in a
violent outcome.</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">Any future exercises, including disarmament of armed actors,
should be conducted by peaceful negotiation.
