CTSAMVM REPORT 2021/
DETENTION OF A CTSAMVM HELICOPTER</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">BY THE SSPDF 16 AUGUST 2021
1.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">

</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">a.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">On 16 August 2021 the CTSAMVM Monitoring and Verification Team (MVT)
based in Torit undertook a routine visit to Ikatos.

</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">b. Before the visit the MVT had informed the SSPDF Brigade  commander,
Brigadier General Maryano Olong, (who has a Company at Ikotos), the County
Commissioner of Ikotos and the company commander of the forces in Ikotos,
Captain David Oluway.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">There is no need for CTSAMVM to inform the SSPDF
of its movements, but the MVT did so as a matter of courtesy.

2.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">Incident:</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">

</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">a.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">The team arrived and landed at Ikotos County and proceeded to the County
Headquarters offices for the planned meeting with the Executive Director.

</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">When the  meeting was about to start the  team received a call from a
CTSAMVM International Observer who had been left behind with the helicopter
for security  purposes, who reported the  helicopter had been arrested  by
SSPDF forces, and that he and the crew were ordered out and their telephones
confiscated.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">

</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">c. The MVT immediately cancelled the meeting and headed back to the landing
site.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">On arrival the team met Captain David Oluway, the officer in charge of the
SSPDF Company in Ikotos, who had arrested the helicopter and its crew.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">He

told the MVT that although he had been informed of the visit by the Executive
Director of Ikatos, he takes his orders from the Brigade Commander who had
ordered him to detain the helicopter.
</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">a
d. The helicopter was detained for around 45 minutes by a force of about 15
SSPDF soldiers armed with AK47’s and RPGs.

€.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">Following the intervention of the CTSAMVM SSPDF National Monitor and the
CTSAMVM SSPDF Senior National Liaison Officer the helicopter was released
and returned safely to Torit.

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">

</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">a. The reasons the SDSPDF decided to arrest the CTSAMVM helicopter remain
unclear.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">It was on a routine mission, and both the military and civil authorities
had been informed.

</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">The freedom of movement of CTSAMVM guaranteed under the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">

</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">c.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">This incident constituted a clear and blatant violation of the R-ARCSS

4.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">Conclusion:</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">By detaining a CTSAMVM helicopter at Ikatos on 16 August 2021, and
by arresting CTSAMVM personnel and confiscating their telephones, the SSPDF
acted in blatant violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically those prohibited actions

under Article 2.1.10:</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">

</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">a. Article 2.2.10.0:</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">“acts of   hostility, intimidation, violence or   attacks
against....CTSAMVM personnel...”

b. Article 2.0.10.0:</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">“movement and  access restrictions on CTSAMVM and
UNMISS/RPF personnel  performing their duties as  prescribed by their
mandated...”

5. Observations and recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">

</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">a.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">The R-ARCSS was signed nearly  years ago.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">It is difficult to understand how
any senior SSPDF could remain ignorant of the provisions of the R-ARCSS in
regard to the freedom of movement accorded to CTSAMVM, and order the
detention of a CTSAMVM helicopter in so obvious a violation of the Agreement.

</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">b. CTSAMVM recommends that the SSPDF carries out an investigation in order
to determine the source of the order to detain the helicopter.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">The necessary
remedial action can then be taken to ensure such an incident is not repeated.
