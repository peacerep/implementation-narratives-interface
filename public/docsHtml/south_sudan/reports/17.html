<p><a id="5" name="5">This  report  is  submitted  pursuant  to  Chapter  VII,  Article  5  of  the 
Agreement  on  the  Resolution  of  the  Conflict  in  the  Republic  of  South 
Sudan (ARCSS) and covers the period 1st February to 30th April 2017.</a></p>

Overview 

3.  </a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">Whilst there is evidence of greater commitment and determination on the 
part of the current TGoNU, the regional and international community and 
JMEC  members  to  forge  ahead  with  implementation  of  the  ARCSS,  real 
progress  and  tangible  results  are  still  lacking.  </a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">The  political,  security, 
economic  and  humanitarian  situation  in  South  Sudan  continues  to 
deteriorate.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">

</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">In March and April, the security situation deteriorated considerably with a 
pattern  of  increased vindictive violence and retaliatory attacks unleashed 
against  the  civilian  population.  </a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">This  has  in  turn  further  exacerbated  an 
already dire humanitarian and economic situation, in what I referred to as 
a  “crisis  within  a  crisis”  in  my  address  to  the  JMEC  plenary  meeting  of 
April 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">The growing hostility and insecurity drives people off the land, 
affects  productivity  and  commerce,  sends  prices  skyrocketing,  which 
results in hunger and threatens the increased spread of famine.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">

</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The  challenge  now  is  that  across  the  board,  there  appears  to  be  a 
systemic failure of command and control.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">The bulk of the violence being 
perpetuated  by  parties  to  the  ARCSS,  or  their  affiliates,  is  increasingly 
based on local decisions taken at local levels without higher authorisation. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">This  is  further  complicated  by  the  emergence  into  the  conflict  of  other 
armed actors, not affiliated to or controlled by forces allied to any party to 
the  peace  agreement.  </a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">It  has  made  enforcement  of  the  permanent 
ceasefire,  and  monitoring  thereof  impossible  as  one  group  may  declare 
allegiance  to  one  leader  today  and  to  another  tomorrow,  but  evidently 
takes no command or instruction for their action.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">However, this does not

exonerate the principal signatories to the ARCSS from their obligations to 
exercise control and restraint.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">

</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">There  is  an  urgent  need  to  stop  the  proliferation  of  new  armed  groups, 
restore and enforce the permanent ceasefire, embrace a political dialogue 
and  restore  inclusivity  into  the  peace  process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">In  this  regard,  JMEC  calls 
upon the regional and international community to speak with one voice in 
condemning any proposition  of violence and  engage with  all  parties who 
seek a return to the full implementation of the ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">

</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">In  this  reporting  period,  JMEC  convened  three  Plenaries  and  received 
briefings  from  the  TGoNU  and  considered  reports  from  the  different 
Agreement  institutions  and  mechanisms  on  the  implementation  of  the 
Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">In summary, all the reports indicate some new developments 
and  movement  in  the  right  direction,  even  though  the  progress  remains 
too slow and fraught with many challenges.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">

To 
inclusivity  and 
participatory  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  ARCSS,  JMEC  established 
six Thematic Working Committees responsible for each of the chapters of 
the  Agreement  to  work  in  close  consultation  with  the  three  TGoNU 
clusters  –  Governance,  Humanitarian  and  Service  Delivery  respectively. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">Five  of  these  Working  Committees  have  met  and  been  fully  constituted, 
elected  Chairpersons  and  developed  matrices  for  their  evaluation.  </a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">I  am 
grateful to all the members of JMEC, including the TGoNU, for their strong 
support in ensuring that this initiative commenced well and is progressing 
in a very positive and collaborative manner.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">

</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">The  Thematic  Working  Committees  support  JMEC‟s  work,  provide  advice 
and  recommend  remedial  action  to  be  considered  by  the  TGoNU  and 
other  bodies  responsible  for  implementation  of  the  Agreement.  </a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">With 
strong  commitment  by  all  members  and  stakeholders,  the  Thematic 
Working  Committees  will  provide  considerable  leverage  in  the  discharge 
of the mandate of JMEC going forward.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">

10.  </a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">There has also been some improvement particularly in the opening of new 
humanitarian corridors for food relief to reach the famine stricken areas in 
South  Sudan.  </a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">However,  JMEC  remains  extremely  concerned  about  the 
safety  of  humanitarian  operators  and  the  constraints  affecting  free  and 
unfettered access imposed by the government and the armed opposition. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">Humanitarian  organisations  will  continue  to  face  severe  setbacks  as  the 
security outlook in most areas of the country appears to be deteriorating 
as fighting continues.</a></p>

<p><a id="44" name="44">JMEC  continues  to  receive  reports  of  ceasefire  violations  from  CTSAMM 
and has submitted ten (10) specific violation reports to the authorities of 
both  the  SPLM/A-IG  and  SPLM/A–IO.  JMEC  has  yet  to  receive  feedback 
from the aforementioned authorities on the reports or actions undertaken 
to address the concerns raised.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">

<p><a id="46" name="46">The  Joint  Military  Ceasefire  Committee  (JMCC)  is  pressing  forward  with 
cantonment  planning,  and  is  currently  focusing  efforts  on  two  (02)  sites 
near Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">I welcome the announcement by the TGoNU on 27 April 2017 
regarding  the  allocation  of  some  funds  for  cantonment.  </a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">The  timely 
disbursement of the funds to the JMCC will be critical to facilitate its work 
in  preparing  the  cantonment  sites,  as  well  as  developing  and  training  of 
the  Area  Joint  Military  Ceasefire  Commission  (AJMCC)  and  Joint  Military 
Ceasefire  Teams  (JMCT‟s),  and  conducting  joint  site  surveys  of  the 
projected cantonment sites throughout the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">

13.  </a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">Members  of  an  advance  party  of  the  Regional  Protection  Force  (RPF) 
arrived in Juba but the rest of the Force has not yet been deployed.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">The 
RPF  is  essential  to  support  the  demilitarisation  and  pacification  of  Juba 
and  its  environs,  as  well  as  in  creating  a  conducive  environment  for  the 
implementation of the Peace Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">

14.  </a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">The  economic  crisis  in  South  Sudan  continues,  driven  by  declining  oil 
production,  low  oil  prices  and  decline  in  food  production.  </a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">The  South 
Sudanese Pound (SSP) continues to depreciate and inflation remains high. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">However the economic measures implemented by the TGoNU to enhance 
economic stability have had some success.</a></p>

<p><a id="59" name="59">The  National  Constitutional  Amendment  Committee  (NCAC)  is  now  fully 
constituted and  is finally making substantial progress in  the execution of 
its tasks as stipulated under Art.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">13 of Chapter 1 of the ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">The NCAC 
has  completed  the  drafting  of  the  Constitutional  Amendment  Bill  (2017) 
incorporating  provisions  of 
the  Transitional 
Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan  (2011).  </a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">The  Constitutional 
Amendment  Bill  was  officially  presented  to  the  Ministry  of  Justice  and 
Constitutional  Affairs  on  April  13,  2017.  </a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">The  Minister  has  prepared  a 
memo presenting the draft Bill to the TGoNU Council of Ministers.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">I now 
call  upon  the  TGoNU  to  expedite  this  process  and  ensure  that  the

ratified by the President within the mandated period.</a></p>

16.  </a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Although  the  process  for  the  ratification  of  the  draft  Constitutional 
Amendment Bill (2017) is yet to be concluded, the finalisation of the draft 
Constitutional  Amendment  Bill  is  a  significant  milestone  that  has  been 
achieved.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">The incorporation of the ARCSS into the TCRSS 2011 makes it 
possible for the TGoNU to commence the Permanent Constitution making 
process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">The  TGoNU  therefore  should  finalise  this  process  and  take 
immediate steps to initiate the Permanent Constitution making process.</a></p>

<p><a id="70" name="70">Upon  completion  of  the  first  phase  of  its  tasks,  the  NCAC  has  now

<p><a id="82" name="82">The  National  Dialogue  initiative  of  H.E.  Salva  Kiir  Mayardit,  President  of

welcomes 
the

<p><a id="86" name="86">In my considered view, a genuine and inclusive National Dialogue process 
would  complement  the  ARCSS,  encourage  a  cessation  of  hostilities  and 
enable  all  parties  to  engage  in  a  political  process  that  would  lead  to  a 
ceasefire and create conditions conducive to its inclusive implementation.</a></p>

<p><a id="89" name="89">There  were  increased  hostilities  and  major  violations  of  the  ceasefire  in 
the months of March and April.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">Despite the call for a unilateral ceasefire 
by IGAD in the same period, fighting between government and opposition

<p><a id="94" name="94">Fighting also broke out in Wau, Eastern Lakes state, and clashes 
occurred in Western Bahr El Ghazal, Upper Nile and Unity states resulting 
in the reported death of 50 civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">

21.  </a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">There  are  reports  of  continuing  and  increasing  incidents  of  targeted  and 
retaliatory  killings,  sexual  violence,  torture  and  destruction  of  farmland 
and  property,  committed  by  uniformed  forces  as  well  as  Other  Armed 
Groups  (OAGs).  </a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">The  main  highways  and  commercial  transit  arteries 
remain highly dangerous due to the large number of robberies, ambushes 
and  murders.  </a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">The  extent  to  which  these  incidents  can  be  attributed  to 
forces  aligned  with  the  TGoNU,  the  Opposition  Groups  or  OAG‟s,  is  very 
difficult to prove because of the growing complexities of the conflict.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">

22.  </a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">Some  of  the  confrontations  were  allegedly  between  cattle  raiders 
motivated by the desire to acquire more livestock and control of resources 
such as land, food and water rather than political affiliations.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">As a result, 
increasing  numbers  of  people  were  reported  to  be  fleeing  these  areas, 
and in many cases the country, to avoid or escape the cycle of violence – 
be  it  by  uniformed  forces  confronting  political  opponents,  OAGs  staking 
their 
influence,  or  opportunistic  elements,  criminal  or  pastoral 
communities competing for resources.</a></p>

<p><a id="103" name="103">Ceasefire Violations 

23.  </a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">Verification of violations of the ceasefire remains complex due to the split 
of SPLM-IO, the proliferation of unidentified OAGs and non-signatories to 
the  Agreement  which  do  not  fall  under  CTSAMM‟s  verification  and 
investigation operations mandate.</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">JMEC  issued ten  (10) specific violation 
reports  to  both  the  SPLM  and  SPLM–IO  authorities  and  is  yet  to  receive 
feedback on them or on subsequent and substantive actions taken.</a></p>

<p><a id="118" name="118">With  the  release  of  funds  for  cantonment,  announced  by

<p><a id="202" name="202">Economic Trends 

52.  </a></p>
<p><a id="203" name="203">The  civil  conflict  together  with  depressed  oil  prices,  continues  to  weigh 
heavily  on  economic  conditions  within  South  Sudan.  </a></p>
<p><a id="204" name="204">The  economy  has 
contracted  markedly,  due  to  declining  production  of  oil,  but  also  within 
the  agriculture  sector.  </a></p>
<p><a id="205" name="205">Oil  revenues  are  not  only  the  dominant  revenue 
resource for the government but are also the main source of international 
currency  for  financing  imports.  </a></p>
<p><a id="206" name="206">Thus,  marked  shifts  in  production  and 
prices have huge economic impacts, both on the budget and on financing 

 

 

11 

domestic  consumption  and  investments.  </a></p>
<p><a id="207" name="207">GDP,  calculated  in  USD,  is 
estimated  to  fall  by  80  percent  over  the  two-year  period  2014/15  to 
2016/17.</a></p>
<p><a id="208" name="208">

53.  </a></p>
<p><a id="209" name="209">The fiscal deficit moved from 3 per cent of GDP in 2013/14 to 31 per cent 
in  2015/16.  </a></p>
<p><a id="210" name="210">However  preliminary  indications  are  that  a  tighter  budget, 
more  effective  controls  of  budget  execution,  better  than  projected  oil 
prices  combined  with  the  moderating  impact  of  the  exchange  rate 
changes, has resulted in a substantive reduction in the deficit in the first 
half of 2016/17.</a></p>
<p><a id="211" name="211">

54.  </a></p>
<p><a id="212" name="212">The actions of the authorities to monetize the large fiscal deficit occurring 
in 2015/16 led to unusually strong money growth, a large exchange rate 
depreciation  and  consequently  severe  inflation.  </a></p>
<p><a id="213" name="213">The  lingering  impact  of 
this  policy  stance  continues  to  date,  despite  a  temporary  respite  in 
inflation in the last quarter of 2016, and notwithstanding the more recent 
prudent  approach  in  the  2016/17  budget  in  addressing  the  fiscal  deficit. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="214" name="214">Indeed,  since  December  2016  the  exchange  rate  has  been  steadily 
weakening  reaching  a  peak  of  200  SSP/USD  in  April  2017  in  the  parallel 
market before falling back to a range of 140 – 160 SSP/USD. 

55.  </a></p>
<p><a id="215" name="215">Given  the country‟s high dependence on imports, the precipitous slide in 
the  currency  value  translates  almost  immediately  to  high  levels  of 
inflation.</a></p>
<p><a id="216" name="216">Shortfalls in domestic food production have further exacerbated 
the  import  situation  thus  placing  an  increasing  burden  on  the  most 
vulnerable  within  society.  </a></p>
<p><a id="217" name="217">Prices  in  April  were  almost  5  per  cent  higher 
than  in  March.  </a></p>
<p><a id="218" name="218">On  an  annual  basis,  inflation  is  declining  due  to  the 
cumulative effects of tighter fiscal policies, but inflation still  stood at 273 
per cent in April.</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="220" name="220">Economic Outlook 

56.  </a></p>
<p><a id="221" name="221">If  South  Sudan  continues  to  pursue  tight  fiscal  and  monetary  policies 
aimed  at  lowering  deficits,  inflation  and  exchange  rate  depreciation  is 
expected  to  moderate  further  thus  contributing  to  an  improvement  in 
overall  economic  stability.  </a></p>
<p><a id="222" name="222">However  net  oil  revenues  cannot  be  expected 
to  increase  significantly  soon,  given  the  present  oil  price  and  production 
trends.  </a></p>
<p><a id="223" name="223">It  is  likely  that  South  Sudan  will  continue  to  find  itself  in  a  very 
difficult  budget  situation  over  the  medium  term.  </a></p>
<p><a id="224" name="224">Thus,  new  domestically

remains  precarious  and  not  conducive  for  the  full  implementation  of  the 
ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="266" name="266">The  recent  escalation  of  armed  violence  resulted  from  the  July 
2016  clashes  in  Juba  which  was  a  flagrant  violation  of  the  permanent 
ceasefire  by  both  parties  (SPLA-IG/IO).  </a></p>
<p><a id="267" name="267">This  remains  the  primary  factor 
exacerbating  the  worsening  economic  and  humanitarian  situation,  and  is 
an  impediment  to  inclusive  political  and  social  progress  in  the  country. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="268" name="268">The growing insecurity continues to cause civilian flight, displacement and 
constitutes an obstacle to humanitarian access and implementation of the 
ARCSS.  </a></p>
