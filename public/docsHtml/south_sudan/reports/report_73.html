CTSAMVM REPORT 2022/09
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In mid-January 2022, there were complaints of murder by SPLM/A-IO’s Brig Gen
Philip Piol Ajak and soldiers under his command in Bahr Urut.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">Two people were
allegedly killed on 12 Jan 2022 and 15 January 2022 by the group.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">There were
allegations of six other murder cases earlier labelled against Brig Gen Philip Piol
Aja’s Group in Udici and Kangi Payams of Jur River County, Western Bahr El
Ghazal.
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">SPLM/A-IO's Brig Gen Philip Piol Ajak together with his six escorts had moved from
Ngo-Halima Cantonment Site in the second half of 2020, to Udici Payam which is 80
Km North West of Wau town and Kangi Payam which is 95Km North West of Wau
town, both of Jur River County in Western Bahr El Ghazal (WBGS) citing welfare
issues.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">The group was affiliated with SPLM/A-IO Division 6A’s Brigade  whose HQ
is based in Wadalelo.
</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">The group was, in January 2022, accused of several counts of murder at Bahr Urut
in Udici Payam.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">The group was also accused of other past murders and violations in
the civilian area that they occupied.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">Due to popular civilian outcry about Brig Gen
Philip Piol Ajak’s activities, on 16 January 2022, a joint government force was
injected in an operation to hunt down the Brig Gen and his group.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The operation
resulted in civilian complaints of harassment, beatings, looting and arbitrary arrests
of civilians.
</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that Brig Philip Piol Ajak and his group of soldiers
are responsible for the death of 08 people.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">The SPLM/A-IO Bde  (Div 6A)
Commander, Maj Gen Twal Twal, is equally liable for the crimes committed by Brig
Gen Ajak because he released him and his soldiers to go and settle in his village
with civilians with their rifles without any means and ways to check and reprimand
them.
</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">CTSAMVM further concludes that SSPDF is equally  responsible for serious
breaches of several provisions of the ACoH and the R-ARCSS including;</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">Failure to
protect and the abuse of human rights of civilians and to ensure the safety of
individuals and communities (ACoH Art 5.1, R-ARCSS Art 2.0.10.0.4, 2.0.3.0), by

sufficient evidence to verify that a Party is not in compliance with the
provisions of the Agreements is “reasonable grounds to believe that the
incident that is the subject of the investigation occurred.”</a></p>

accordance with accepted practice for monitoring mechanisms and
humanitarian entities and signifies that sufficient facts and evidence have
been collected to conclude that an event has occurred.</a></p>
