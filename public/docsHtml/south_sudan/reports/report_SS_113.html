Introduction
, Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">

</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">a. There have for a long time been tensions between the SSPDF garrison in
Nassir and the surrounding population.</a></p>

Ketbeck which is only about  Km from the SSPDF garrison.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">

</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">The last incidents reported in the Nassir area were on  August and 
September 2020, when some local youths allegedly killed an SSPDF soldier,
and this led to a revenge attack in which some youths were killed.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">However,
following a CTSAMVM Joint Field Visit on  October 2020 a Peace and
Reconciliation Conference was convened between the Parties in Mandeng on
20 October 2020 and since then until 14 March 2021 the area has been calm.</a></p>

<p><a id="75" name="75">Each Party had a different
version of exactly what happened.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">

13.0 n 14 March 2021 the SSPDF left their barracks, moved to and searched civilian
houses following the killing of the officer.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">The SSPDF did not, at this stage, contact
the SPLM/A-IO to discuss the incident and what should be done as a result.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">

</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">14.On the morning of 15 March 2021 the SSPDE left their barracks and advanced to
and threatened the SPLM/A-IO barracks at Ketbeck, The garrison and some of
the surrounding villages — where soldiers lived — were burnt.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">By leaving their
barracks and advancing to the SPLM/A-IO barracks the SSPDF in Nassir acted in
clear violation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">

</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">15.A potential clash between the SSPDF and the SPLM/A-|O was avoided by the
actions of SPLM/A-1O Sector  Commander Lt Gen Peter Thok Chuol, who ordered
his soldiers to withdraw from Ketbeck and not to engage the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">The recall and replacement of the SSPDF commander in Nassir, Maj Ben Gordon
Banak Thoan, and the subsequent visit by the JDB did much to reduce tensions in
the area,

Conclusion

17.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">Itis the conclusion of CTSAMVM that by leaving barracks on 15 March 2021 and
advancing to and burning the SPLM/A-IO barracks in Ketbeck the SSPDE acted in
clear violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically article 2.0.9:</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">“No revenge, vengeance

or retribution and any kind of violation of the Permanent Ceasefire is allowed under
any circumstances.”
Observations and Recommendations
18.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">The killing of the SSPDF officer on 14 March 2021 was a tragic incident which
resulted from some sort of altercation with armed civilians,  Following the Peace
and Reconciliation Conference in Mandeng on 20 October 2020 the mechanisms
have been in place to manage these sorts of incidents.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">It was unfortunate the
SSPDF commander decided to take direct action rather than contact the SPLM/A-
 commander and resolve it amicably.
19.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">The SPLM/A-IO acted commendably during the incident, and the SSPDF and JDB
must also be commended for their actions taken after the incident:</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">
</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">a.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">The SPLM/A-IO refrained from reacting to the SSPDF advance to their
barracks at Ketbeck.
</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">b. The SSPDF took quick remedial action by replacing the SSPDF commander
in Nassir.
</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">c, JDB acted swiftly to defuse tensions in the area
</a></p>
