On  October 2022 CTSAMVM received allegations that there had been harassment
and looting by SPLM/A-IO Soldiers in the Morobo area.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">There were also allegations
of rape.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">Following an investigation, which included interviews with a wide range of local
people, CTSAMVM concluded that there had indeed been cases of harassment and
looting of local people by SPLM/A-IO Soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">CTSAMVM also verified one case of
rape by an SPLM/A-IO soldier.
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">It became apparent during the investigation that there had been complaints of
harassment prior to those investigated by CTSAMVM, and a workshop had been
arranged with local communities and the SPLM/A-IO in Panyume in early September
to address these complaints.
</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">CTSAMVM recommends that the SPLM/A-IO undertakes an enquiry into the cases
of looting and rape, and restores discipline in its ranks.

¥ “sou”

a. The general situation in the Morobo/Panyume area has been relatively
calm.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">Relations between the SSPDF and the SPLM/A-IO have been
generally good since the signing of the R-ARCSS.

b. The last CTSAMVM reports concerning violations in the area were in April
and July 2021 (numbers 2021/05 and 2021/09).</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The first of these was
about the illegal detention of a civilian by the SPLM/A-IO and the second
was rape by an SPLM/A-IO soldier.

2. Allegations:</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">

a. On  October 2022 CTSAMVM received allegations from a Civil Society
Organisation (CSO) that SPLM/A-IO soldiers from Panyume had been
harassing civilians in the Morobo area.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">There were specific allegations that
 women had been raped, one of whom died.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">Shortly after this, reports
appeared in the media about the behaviour of SPLM/A-IO soldiers in the
area.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">The SPLM/A-IO Spokesperson, Colonel Lam Paul Gabriel, promised
an enquiry.

b. On  October 2022 the CTSAMVM Monitoring and Verification Team (MVT)
based in Yei called the Morobo County Commissioner in order to
corroborate these allegations.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">The County Commissioner said that there
had been many acts of harassment by soldiers from the SPLM/A-IO Mobile
Force in Panyume starting in late September.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">He went on to say that 
women had been raped, 814 people displaced and belongings and goods
looted.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">CTSAMVM called the SPLM/A-IO Head of Military Intelligence in
Panyume who denied the allegations, saying they were propaganda by
politicians and NGOs in the area.

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">Aim</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">:</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">The aim of this report is to present the findings of CTSAMVM investigations
into alleged or suspected violations of provisions of applicable agreements, to
attribute responsibility for breaches of the agreements, and to make
recommendations with regard to compliance actions that will help foster peace
and reconciliation.

provisions of the Agreements is “reasonable grounds to believe that the
incident that is the subject of the investigation occurred.”</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">This is in
accordance with accepted practice for monitoring mechanisms and human-
rights- and humanitarian- entities and signifies that sufficient facts and
evidence have been collected to conclude that an event has occurred.

<p><a id="40" name="40">Harassment of civilians and looting:</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">

different villages in  Bomas from Gulumbi Payam, who had taken refuge in
Tanganyika Church in Morobo.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">They all claimed to have had belongings
and food looted by SPLM/A-IO soldiers between about 28 — 30 September
2022:</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">

i. Most of the IDP’s were recent returnees from Uganda;</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">one had moved
to Gulumbi Payam following a NAS attack in Kimba Payam in early
2022.

ii.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">All the IDP’s stated they had been threatened by armed, uniformed men
who they all described as being SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">One — a village headman —
was accused by the soldiers of being a “rebel”.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">One IDP described their
uniforms as being a mixture of civilian and military, and another they
were like UPDF uniforms;</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">the others just described the soldiers as being
SPLM/A-IO in groups from  to 17.

iii, One of the IDP’s said she recognised one of the soldiers as being a
neighbour when she was in an IDP camp in Uganda.

iv.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">All the IDP’s complained that they had food, animals and household
goods stolen from them at gunpoint.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">One soldier said he was stealing
the food because “...they were suffering while other people were
enjoying”.

v. Several IDP’s complained that SPLM/A-IO soldiers harassed youths in
the area, accusing them of belonging to the rebels.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">The County
Commissioner also claimed this was the case.

vi.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">Two of the IDP’s claimed they had been beaten by SPLM/A-IO soldiers
when they were looted.

</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">c. CEPO explained that they had hosted a workshop for senior SPLM/A-lO
officers and civilians on - September 2022 in Panyume following
complaints of looting and harassment by SPLM/A-IO soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">It was
arranged with Major General John Mabieh, but on the day the senior
SPLM/A-IO officer who attended was Brigadier Emmanuel Lemi.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">The
workshop resulted in 14 resolutions, but these have yet to be signed by the
SPLM/A-IO.

d.CTSAMVM visited Panyume and met with Major General John Mabieh, the
commander of SPLM/A-IO Mobile Force, Major General Jima Machual and

Brigadier Emmanuel Lemi, the Acting Commander of SPLMW/A-IO Division

2B.

i. Both Major General Mabieh and Brigadier Lemi denied that their soldiers
had been harassing civilians and looting in the area.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">They said that
there were no complaints by civilians until the CEPO workshop of -
September, which had given civilians the idea to complain.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">Major

General Machual said that he comes from the area and would “not be
silent if civilians were looted and raped...”.
</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">ii.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">Major General Mabieh said that if the SPLM/A-IO needed food from
civilians, they would request it through traditional leaders.
6.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">Rape:</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">

a. CTSAMVM was given various allegations of rape:</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">NSS claimed there had
been  women raped by the SPLM/A-IO both of whom had gone to Uganda
for treatment.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">The County Commissioner alleged there were two rape
cases — one a 30-year-old pregnant woman, and another pregnant woman
who went to Uganda where she died.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">The Paramount Chief gave the
names of two women — a mother and daughter — who he said were both
raped by SPLM/A-IO soldiers and who had subsequently been taken to
Uganda by their husbands.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">The same allegation was made by the CEPO
Field Officer who also mentioned the case of the 30-year-old pregnant
woman as did the Morobo Gender Representative.

b. The Police Inspector in Morobo said that rape was rarely reported to the
police because of the social stigma attached and also because of fear of
retribution.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">CTSAMVM was told about the 30-year-old pregnant victim by
the clinical officers at Morobo Primary Healthcare Centre and Kendila
Primary Healthcare Unit, which had treated the victim.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">CTSAMVM was told
by health workers at Kendila that in August/September they had dealt with 
girls and women who claimed to be victims of attempted rape by SPLM/A-lO
soldiers, but were unable to give CTSAMVM the details.

</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">c. The only case where CTSAMVM was able to access the victim and
investigate was that of the 30-year-old pregnant woman.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">CTSAMVM
interviewed her and her husband at the Sudan Pentecostal Church in
Morobo where they were taking refuge;</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">it was confirmed by health workers
at Kendila she had been raped and was given PEP and ongoing medical

treatment.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">She was  months pregnant and a mother.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">The results of the

investigation are as follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">

i. The victim stated that at about 10.0  Hrs on 29 September 2022 
armed SPLM/A-IO soldiers came to her compound, where she was in
the company of some of her neighbours,  men and  women.
</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">CTSAMVM asked her how she knew they were SPLM/A-IO soldiers,
and she said she knew the difference between SSPDF and SPLW/A-IO
uniforms, and she recognised them as being SPLM/A-IO because she
had seen them before.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">She also said that they spoke the Nuer
language.

ii.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">The victim said that while the soldiers were still in the compound she
went into her house to see one of her children.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">One of the soldiers
followed her into the house and raped her at gunpoint.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">The soldiers left
the compound at about 12.0  Hrs, having looted maize flour, clothes
and other household items.

iii.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">The victim’s husband said that on 28 September 2022  SPLM/A-IO
soldiers came to his house and took maize.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">The next day, 29
September 2022, he said he met a group of about 17 SPLM/A-lO
soldiers whilst he was on the way to Morobo.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">He ran back home.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">He
went on further to state that one of the soldiers raped his wife on that
same day of 29 September 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">After his wife was raped and the
soldiers left, the family spent a night at their home and the next day on
Friday, 30 September 2022, he took his wife to Kendila Primary Health
Care Unit where she was given medical attention.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">He later took his wife
to Morobo town to seek shelter.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">He went back to his home on 11
October 2022 and met his neighbours who told him the SPLM/A-IO
soldiers had returned and they had all taken their wives to Uganda for
safety.

ASSESSMENT

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">CEPO organised a workshop with the SPLM/A-lO at the beginning of September
to address concerns about the relationship between SPLM/A-IO and _ local
civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">There had been complaints of harassment and also of SPLM/A-lO
soldiers looting food.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">The fact that the workshop was thought necessary, and
was supported by the SPLM/A-IO suggests that there were issues before the
incidents of 28-30 September described by IDP witnesses which led to the
displacement of a large number of civilians.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">Logistic provision to Cantonment Sites has been very limited and in many places
non-existent.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">Previous CTSAMVM visits to Panyume have observed and
reported lack of food supplies.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">It is not surprising that the soldiers there are
hungry.

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">It is the assessment of CTSAMVM that that SPLM/A-IO soldiers have been
involved in looting and harassing civilians in Morobo County, and that this has led
to some displacement.

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">It is the assessment of CTSAMVM that an SPLM/A-IO soldier did commit rape on
28 September as outlined above.

CONCLUSIONS

11.CTSAMVM concludes that:</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">

a. By harassing civilians and looting food, animals and household items on
and around 28-30 September 2022 in Morobo County soldiers belonging to
the SPLM/A-IO acted in violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically Article
2.0.10.0:</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">“Acts of hostility, intimidation, violence or attacks against the
following:</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">civilian population including IDPs.....”

b. An SPLM/A-IO soldier committed an act of rape on 29 September 2022 in
violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically Article 2.0.10.0:</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">“Acts and forms of
sexual and gender-based violence, including sexual exploitation and
harassment”.

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

12.The SPLM/A-IO needs to restore discipline in its forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">The delay to the start of
phase  training and lack of any sort of adequate logistic support has without
doubt put a huge strain on soldiers in Cantonment Sites who struggle to survive.
</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">However, to steal food and goods from civilians who are also struggling to survive
is against the spirit and word of the R-ARCSS and will only serve to destroy any
trust between civilians and the military which should be protecting them.

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">CTSAMVM recommends that:</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">

a. The SPLM/A-IO conducts an enquiry as promised by the SPLM/A-lO
spokesman, and holds any soldiers found to have committed offences to
account.

b. The SPLM/A-IO leadership in Panyume investigates the rape incident, in
order to try and identify the perpetrator and see that justice is done.
