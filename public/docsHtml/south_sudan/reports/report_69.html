<p><a id="13" name="13">SUMMARY

</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">On 11 September 2011 a civilian, Mr Manase Kundu Festo, was forced to take part
in an SSPDF patrol to locate NAS positions near Kenyi Boma, Central Equatoria.
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">Three other civilians were also forced to take part in the patrol.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">There was an attack
on the patrol by an unidentified armed group and in crossfire between SSPDF and
the armed group Mr Manase was killed.

</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">Following the attack two civilian women were arrested by the SSPDF and detained
and mistreated at an SSPDF barracks.

</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that by forcing Manase Kundu Festo and the other
three men to take part in a military operation against their will, the SSSPDF acted in
clear violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically articles 2.1.10.0  and 2.0.10.0.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">The
arrest and mistreatment of two civilian women is a violation of the R-ARCSS,
specifically articles 2.0.10.0  and 2.0.10.0.5.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The theft of property and goods from
civilians is a violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically articles 2.0.10.0.

CENTRAL EQUATORIA

</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">Introduction

1.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">There has been tension between the SSPDF and civilians in the
Lainya area in Central Equatoria since 2018.This is due to the presence of
alleged NAS elements, and the SSPDF blames civilians for providing them
support.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">CTSAMVM has submitted two reports in 2021 concerning violations
committed by the SSPDF against civilians in the Lainya area:</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">2021/01 ‘Rape and
killing of civilians in the Lainya area’;</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">and 2021/11 ‘Killing of civilians in Central
Equatoria State’.

2.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">Allegations:</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">On 12 September 2021 CTSAMVM received information from the
Ecumenical Church of South Sudan (ECSS) Bishop Rufus Lemi of Lainya that
one man had been killed by the SSPDF and two women arrested during an
encounter with suspected NAS forces at Lokosok in Kenyi Boma, Kenya Payam,
Lainya County.

<p><a id="30" name="30">Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">The aim of this report is to present the findings of CTSAMVM investigations
into violations, to attribute responsibility for breaches of the agreements where
applicable, and to make recommendations with regard to compliance actions that
will help foster peace and reconciliation.

4.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">

</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">a. Between 13 September and  December 2021 CTSAMVM visited Limbe, Yei
and Kenyi Boma and interviewed a total of 14 witness as follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">

</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">The standard of proof used by CTSAMVM to determine whether there is
sufficient evidence to verify that a Party is not in compliance with the
provisions of the Agreements is “reasonable grounds to believe that the
incident that is the subject of the investigation occurred.”</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">This is in
accordance with accepted practice for monitoring mechanisms and
humanitarian entities and signifies that sufficient facts and evidence have
been collected to conclude that an event has occurred.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">

</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">Findings

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">On 12 September 2021 CTSAMVM was informed by the ECSS Bishop of Lainya,
that on 11 September 2021 , a civilian , Mr Manase Kundu Festo, had been killed
at Lokosoko.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">He further informed CTSAMVM that during or after the incident two
women had been arrested by SSPDF at Kenyi Payam, Lainya County.

6.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">On 13 September 2021 CTSAMVM met the SSPDF Deputy Counter Intelligence
officer, Yei County, Lt James Chol.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">He stated that:</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">the man who had been killed
was called Manase Kundu Festo, a civilian who had gone to the SSPDF base at
Kenyi and said that he knew where a NAS base was located.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">He was asked to
show the SSPDF the NAS base location and according to Lt James Chol he
volunteered to do so.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">That on 11 September Mr Manase took them to the site
but it had been vacated, and the soldiers decided to return;</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">however, Manase
Kundo Festo advised them to take a different route and they fell into an ambush.
</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">Mr Manase was killed in the crossfire, and one soldier was wounded.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Two
women were near the ambush site, and they were taken back to the SSPDF base
“for their own safety”.

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">According to the SSPDF patrol commander, Lt Kongon, on 11 September 2021,
he along with his soldiers left the SSPDF base at Kenyi at about 4.0  ona
patrol to find the alleged NAS bases.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">He later took  civilian men — including Mr
Manase — as they were moving towards Kenyi Payam in order that the patrol be
shown the location of an NAS bases.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">Lt Kongon said he knew Manase because
he was prominent in the community.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">Lt Kongon also said that on the patrol Mr
Manase denied that he had any knowledge of the NAS bases locations, which
contradicts the statement of the SSPDF Counter Intelligence Officer.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">Mr Manase’s step father (also his uncle), step mother and wife witnessed the
SSPDF patrol taking him on 11 September 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">They said that Mr Manase was
working in the fields when the patrol arrived at between 5.0  Hrs and 6.0 
Hrs.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">The soldiers took his mobile ‘phone and forced him to go with them to the
bush towards the village of Wandosok.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">The witnesses stated that Mr Manase did
not volunteer to join the patrol.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">The three other men from Kenyi taken by SSPDF along with Mr Manase on 11
Sept were brothers.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">CTSAMVM interviewed one of them (James), who clearly
stated that they and Manase were forcibly taken by the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">The witness
accounts were supported by the Paramount Chief of Lainya and the Kenyi Boma
chief.

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">The SSPDF patrol with Mr Manase and the three other civilian men left Kenyi and
passed by Lomilikin Primary Health Care Clinic (PHCC).</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">According to the
witness James the SSPDF spotted some footprints by the PHCC and asked
Manese if he knew about them;</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">he said he had no idea whose they were, but the
patrol followed the footprints to Wandosok, which is approximately  Km from
Manase’s house.                                             -

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">At Wandosok the patrol found two women in a house.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">They surrounded the
house and questioned the women, the location and questioning was confirmed by
Lt Kongon the patrol commander.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">According to the two women and witness
James the soldiers took their mobile ‘phones, and they were questioned about a
place called Lomikilin (which according to Mr Manase the patrol had already
passed.) and another place called Lobosok.

12.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">As the women were being questioned the SSPDF soldiers were attacked.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">There
was an outbreak of gunfire and the soldiers and civilians ran for cover.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">Witness
James stated that he followed Mr Manase and lay down during the shooting
which is reported to have lasted for about 20 minutes.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">When the shooting was
over Mr Manase was found to have been struck by bullets and been killed.
</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">According to the SSPDF Deputy Director of Counter Intelligence and SSPDF
Brigade  Intelligence Officer an SSPDF soldier was wounded.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">However no
reports of SSPDF casualties were provided by the civilian witnesses or the patrol
commander.

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">According to Lt Kongon, Mr Manase was killed by shots fired from the direction of
the assailants, who he described as “NAS rebels”.

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">The SSPDF patrol did not follow up on the attack and pursue the attackers.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">The
patrol was terminated after the shooting the body of Mr Manase was left where it
lay, but on the way back to their base the patrol released James and the other
two men so that they could assist the family with the recovery of the body.

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">Lt Kongon arrested the two women who had been at the scene of the attack and
took them to the SSPDF  Brigade Headquarters at Limbe.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">According to the two
women:</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">

</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">a.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">They were initially taken to the SSPDF base at Kenyi, where they were
questioned about NAS positions.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">Later, at 16.0  Hrs on 11 September 2021
:</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">              
</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">they were taken to SSPDF  Brigade in Limbe, where they claimed they were
put in chains and kept in the cells.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">They were questioned further.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">

</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">At 7.0  on 12 September 2021 they were released by the Lainya County
Commissioner.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">This was confirmed by the Kenyi Payam Administrator.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">The
women were taken to the Limbe PHCC for medical checks and handed to the
Limbe Chief who handed them on to the Keny Boma Chief.

</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">c. Both women claimed that during their time in SSPDF custody they were
beaten.</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">One of them — aged 50 — said that two months after the incident she
still felt unwell as a result of the mistreatment and had sought medical help.
</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">The two arrested women said that when they were being held at the SSPDF
barracks at Kenyi they saw goods that had been taken from the villagers.
</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">One of the women said she recognised clothes and a jerry-can of honey that
belonged to her.

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">Witness James said that on the way back to Kenyi after the shooting incident and
before he and his brothers were released, he witnessed the SPDF soldiers taking
 goats and some clothes from the home of an old man.

17.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">After the death of Mr Manase the SSPDF made no attempt to contact or see
Manase’s wife or family after the incident.  </a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">They released James and his brothers
to a local chief near Kenyi — who also happened to be Manase’s step-father —
and that is when his death became known.

18.</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">The Kenyi Payam Administrator stated that he reported the death of Manase to
the County Executive Director in order that it could be followed up, but as of early
November 2021 had no further information.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">

</a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">a.</a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">No SSPDF officers visited or had anything to do with Manase’s family
following his death.</a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">According to Lt Kongon no complaint was made by the
family.</a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">None of the SSPDF officers interviewed by CTSAMVM expressed any

             
regret for the death of Manase, nor did they assume any responsibility for
what happened to him.</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">

</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">b. Mr Manase Kundu Festo was 57 years old.</a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">He was a well-known figure in
Kenyi who acted as secretary to the Boma Chief.</a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">His body was carried back
to Kenyi on the afternoon of 11 September and he was buried the following
day.</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">He left three wives and 11 children.

</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">Assessment

19.</a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">Manase Kundu Festo was killed during a firefight between an SSPDF patrol, and
unknown gunmen suspected by the SSPDF to be NAS.</a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">It is not possible to
determine which party was responsible for the fatal shots.</a></p>
<p><a id="129" name="129">He was caught in
crossfire.

20.</a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">Despite the account of Lt Chol, the accounts of the other witnesses indicate that
Manase Kundu Festo was forced to join the SSPDF patrol, together with James
and his two brothers.</a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">He was killed because he was placed in extreme danger
by the actions of the SSPDF and but for the actions of the SSPDF he would not
have been killed.</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">The statement made by Lt Chol that Mr Manase volunteered to
guide the patrol is not credible because witness statements indicate that he was
forcibly taken from his farm by the patrol.</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">Furthermore The patrol commander
also stated that Mr Manase did not know the location of the alleged NAS base.

21.</a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">The SSPDF arrested, mistreated and detained  for two nights in a military
barracks the two women who happened to be at the site of the shooting.</a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">No
reasons or justification for the arrests were provided by the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="136" name="136">

22.</a></p>
<p><a id="137" name="137">During the patrol the SSPDF personnel stole personal belongings and livestock
from civilians.

23.</a></p>
<p><a id="138" name="138">The tragic circumstances of the death of Mr  Manase and the subsequent
mistreatment of the two women who were arrested and the subsequent theft of

              ‘|
property indicate that the SSPDF completely failed to protect the civilians of
Kenyi Boma.

</a></p>
<p><a id="139" name="139">Conclusions

24.</a></p>
<p><a id="140" name="140">CTSAMVM concludes that:</a></p>
<p><a id="141" name="141">

</a></p>
<p><a id="142" name="142">a. By forcing Manase Kundu Festo and the other three men to take part in a
military operation against their will, the SSSPDF acted in clear violation of the
R-ARCSS, specifically articles 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0.1  and :</a></p>
<p><a id="143" name="143">1.0:7.0:</a></p>
<p><a id="144" name="144">

</a></p>
<p><a id="145" name="145">b. By arresting and mistreating the two women and detaining them in a military
barracks the SSPDF acted in clear violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically
articles 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0.5  and 2.0.10.0.4.</a></p>
<p><a id="146" name="146">

</a></p>
<p><a id="147" name="147">c. By stealing property and goods from civilians the SSPDF acted in clear
violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically articles 2.0.10.0.</a></p>
<p><a id="148" name="148">

</a></p>
<p><a id="149" name="149">Observations and Recommendations

25.</a></p>
<p><a id="150" name="150">It is apparent that the SSPDF has not taken into account and acted on the
recommendations made in CTSAMVM reports 2021/01 and 2021/11 mentioned
above.</a></p>
<p><a id="151" name="151">All SSPDF ranks should be aware of their commitments under the R-
ARCSS to protect civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="152" name="152">

26.</a></p>
<p><a id="153" name="153">The casual theft by SSPDF soldiers of property and goods — including livestock —
displays not only an appalling lack of discipline, but also contempt for the civilians
the SSSPDF has a duty to protect.

27.</a></p>
<p><a id="154" name="154">CTSAMVM recommends that the SSPDF takes all actions necessary to stop
such incidents from happening again.
