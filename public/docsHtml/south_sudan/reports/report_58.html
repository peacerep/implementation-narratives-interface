Jan 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">HQ CTSAMM tasked the team to conduct an investigation along the
corridor between Malakal and Renk.  </a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">Attempts to investigate the violence were
frustrated by Freedom of Movement (FOM) restrictions imposed by Government
Forces as reported in the Interim Report (CTSAMM report 035) presented at the
CTSAMM meeting of '* March 2017).</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">MVT Malakal conducted investigations in
the Malakal once these FOM issues were resolved.

team were tasked in January but were unable to verify the situation in Wau-
Shilluk until  March.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">During the investigation the MVT conducted interviews

<p><a id="35" name="35">Government Forces,
SPLM/A-IO, County Officials, UNMISS, MLOs, UN  Agencies, NGOs,
Community Leaders, Police and most importantly displaced civilians.</a></p>

2.0  Violations of the PCTSA

Timelines

2.1 25-28 January 2017:</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">On 25 Jan between 0600hrs and 1000hrs, fighting erupted
between SPLA/IO and Government Forces in the Deitang area (2 to  kilometers
from the Airport).</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">Several mortar or artillery rounds landed a few metres from the
airport fence and flights were cancelled.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">Malakal town was also shelled in the
late morning;</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">no casualties were reported.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">There was subsequent fighting in the
Dietang area, particularly on the 27" and Warjuak on the 28".</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Reports from local
sources suggested that Government Forces shelled Wau Shilluk.

2.2 29-30 January:</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">Fighting in the areas on the west bank on the Nile opposite
Malakal (Detang, Leleo and Warjuak) reduced, but there continued to be
sporadic clashes around Dolieb Hill.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">MVT Malakal reported the presence of
Government Forces reinforcements in the Malakal area.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">

2.3 31 January — February:</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">The Malakal area appeared relatively calm.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">However,
it was apparent that Government Forces had reinforced the area and tensions
built up in Dolieb Hill and Kaldak/Canal as both Parties  appeared to be
concentrating their forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">

2.4 1- February:</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">There were reports of the shelling of Wau Shilluk causing civilian
casualties.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">The MVT tried to contact Government Forces commanders, but their
calls went unanswered.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">IDPs started to move out of Wau —Shilluk to places of
relative safety and began occupying Abrouc.

2.5 3- February:</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">There was a further outbreak of fighting on the west bank of the
Nile opposite Malakal in the morning of  February, but it soon died down.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">By 

February Government Forces were in control of Wau Shilluk and the MVT
received information to suggest that Government Forces were  continuing to
concentrate in Dolieb Hill and might prosecute offensive operations to the south.
</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Despite numerous attempts, the MVT was unable to contact Government Forces
for comment.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">

</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">2.6 8- February:</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">On 8th February the MVT met with the Acting Commander of 
Division SPLA who agreed they could visit Wau Shilluk on the 9t provided there
was no incidents.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">On the morning of the " artillery or mortar fire was heard to
the north of Malakal and the visit was postponed.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">

</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">

</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">3.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">The Government Forces Commander with responsibility for the Wau-
Shilluk area asserted that the trigger for the violence was a murder of an SPLA
soldier by SPLM/A-IO forces in Deitang sometime between 22 and 25 Jan
2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">The response by the SPLA was to attack Bukieny village which resulted
in a concerted series of engagements over a wider area culminating in the
attack on Wau-Shilluk on 27 Jan 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">The SPLM/A-IO confirmed that the
attack on Bukieng took place and that SPLAM/A-IO did respond.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">The trigger
incident was not recognised by SPLM-IO and could not be verified.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">Even if the
murder did occur the Government Forces response is considered to be
disproportionate.
</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">3.2  </a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">Both parties allege the use of heavy weapons against each other.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">The
Government Forces do have artillery and tanks in the Malakal area.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">The
SPLM/A-IO had access to armoured vehicles because a damaged vehicle was
verified in the Wau-Shilluk area.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">It is not possible to verify the types and
numbers of weapons that were used during the fighting, however there is more
corroborating evidence to indicate that the majority of heavy weapons were in
the hand of Government Forces and that they were responsible for conducting
artillery strikes on SPLM/A-IO controlled areas.
3.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">Wau-Shilluk has been characterised as an IDP location since January
2014 when tens of thousands of predominately Shilluk fled the fighting in
Malakal.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">It has long been recognised as under the control of SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">It
was an established settlement with good shelter, ready access to water,
medical services and relief agencies.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">The attack on Wau-Shilluk resulted in the
displacement of 27000-30000 IDPs, mainly Shilluk, from Wau-Shilluk.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">The
clearance of Wau-Shilluk is clearly shown in the images at Annex A, especially
the imagery which shows the settlement before and after the attack.  </a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">Dwellings
have been extensively destroyed by fire.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">It is alleged by Government Forces
that the destruction was caused by incoming SPLM/A-IO munitions which
started fires which were made worse as a result of the winds, dry weather and
the presence of an SPLM/A-IO ammunition store.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">However there is compelling
evidence from a range of witnesses that the dwellings were set on fire
deliberately by Government Forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">The overhead imagery and photographs
taken on the ground also indicate that specific areas and buildings in Wau-
Shilluk have been targeted rather than destroyed an out-of-control fire.
3.4  </a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">There are widespread reports from witnesses of extensive looting of
dwellings and aid agency property.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">Civilians were killed by shelling before and
during the attack on Wau-Shilluk.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">There were also specific allegations of the
rape of 15 women by Government Forces soldiers.
3.5  </a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">The displaced IDPs moved to Aburoc as a result of the attacks on Wau-
Shilluk from  Feb 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">The journey was completed on foot over two days.
</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">The camp recently created in Aburoc as a result of the displacement is poorly
equipped to deal with the large influx.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">There is inadequate water and shelter
compared to Wau-Shilluk.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">As at 15 March 2017 the WFP had recorded a head
count of 27000 in Aburoc although this will now be higher as a result of 3000
new IDPs arriving after the MVT visit.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">

</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">4.0  Conclusion:</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">

4.1  The attacks on Deitang and Wau-Shilluk were initiated by Government Forces
and were conducted in areas which have long been recognised as under
SPLM/A-IO control.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">By prosecuting these attacks Government Forces were in
clear violation of the following provisions of Chapter II of the ARCSS:</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">Articles
1.0, 1.1, 1.2.4, 1.3
5.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">

5.1  The attack on Wau-Shilluk is a serious violation which has once again impacted
upon the weakest and most vulnerable communities in South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">The
concerted attempts by the Government to prevent and  delay investigation
indicate a low level of commitment to the ARCSS.

5.2.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">There was an ethnic dimension to the violence.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">Shilluk people felt were being
deliberately targeted.</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">The IDPs will only consider returning to Wau-Shilluk if
Government Forces withdraw to Malakal.</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">

5.3  CTSAMM recommends that JMEC pressure the Government to exercise much
greater restraint on their forces, especially when operating in densely populated
civilian areas.

5.4.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">CTSAMM further recommends to JMEC that any future dialogue is fully inclusive
to ensure the security concerns of all communities are addressed.

5.5  </a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">It is recommended that the allegations of rape in Wau-Shilluk are investigated
further by the SPLA and International Agencies.
