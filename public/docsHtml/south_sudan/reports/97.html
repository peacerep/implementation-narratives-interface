Findings

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">The SPLM/A-IO positions at Wangkuerbiy, Kuerkeem, Loolnyang and Jekou
were attacked on 20 Mar 22.

6.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">The SPLM/A-IO forces were dislodged from their Division  HQ at Jekou during
the attack on 20 Mar 22.

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">According to the statements of “Brig Gen” James Gatwech Reath, the Turu
Declaration Chairman, and Brig Gen Nhial Nyal Ding, Deputy Cmdr SSPDF
Special Ops Bde, the attackers are alleged to be armed civilians (Armed Youth)
mobilized and commanded by “Brig Gen” James Gatwech Reath himself,
assisted by members of his team from the Maiwut County government and from
Juba who mobilized the Youth and other civilians and led them to attack the
SPLM/A-IO positions on 20 Mar 22.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">The members of “Brig Gen” James
Gatwech’s team are also Turu Declaration members and they include:</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">

a.      Mr. Dhan Chuol Kuoth — (Executive Director of Maiwut County)
b.      Mr. Gatluak Manytap Pal — (from Juba)
C.       Mr. Koang Simon Tut — (from Juba)
d.      Madam Elizabeth Mete Puok — (from Juba)

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">The Payam Adminstrator of Jekou Mr. Deng Pal Kueth alleged that the
disagreements in Jekou were between the civilians and the SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">He
further stated that SPLM/A-IO stopped the civilians in the three Payams of Turu,
Jekou and Nyetok not to go to Maiwut to report to the commissioner.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">However,
this allegation is negated by the fact that the attacking forces burnt the civilian
houses in Jekou which forced all the civilians to flee to Ethiopia.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">Had the civilians
been against the SPLM/A-IO, they would not have run away since the SPLM/A-
 were pushed out of Jekou.

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">The Commander of the White Army, Mr Dolek Tut Kuach  and the Payam
Administrator of Jekou, Mr Deng Pal Kueth alleged that the SPLM/A-IO forces
denied civilians to go to Maiwut and arrested Mr. Dhan Chuol Kuoth , Mr Anter
Nyal and Pastor John Chuol accusing them of going to Maiwut.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">They claimed
these to be the major causes that sparked off fighting.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">However, the SPLM/A-IO
Division  Commander denied the allegation stating that, Mr. Anter Nyal is with
him at Wangkeurbiy while Pastor John Chuol is in Maiwut.

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">“Brig Gen” James Gatwech Reath denied CTSAMVM any opportunity to talk to
the few civilians who were in Malual Gahoth including Mr Dhan Chuol Kuoth, who
was allegedly arrested by SPLM/A-IO on accusation that he went to Maiwut.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">Brig
Gatwech Ruth refused Mr. Dhan Chuol speaking to CTSAMVM insisting that he
(James Gatwech) was speaking “on their behalf’.

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">Brig Gen Wal Deng Ador, SSPDF Bde 18 Cmdr claimed that “the civilians who
attacked Jekou had a variety of heavy weapons including RPGs, PKMs, 12.0 mm,
ete which they probably acquired from Arab nomads (Palata) in Sudan or the
Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) rebels in Ethiopia”.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">However, “Brig Gen” James
Gatwech Reath who owned up, claimed and accepted to have led the forces that
fought in Jekou contradicted the claim saying that he only used AK-47 rifles
(SMGs), which looks a cover up of something.

12.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">According to Maj Gen Pal Gatkuoth, the SPLM/A-IO  Deputy Commander 
Division, the SSPDF forces that attacked Jekou were armed with heavy weapons
that included ZU 35, 14.0 mm guns, mounted 12.0 mm weapons and T55 Tanks.
</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">This was also stated on 16 May 22 when CTSAMVM engaged with Gen David
Thok Chuol the Commander SPLM/A-IO  Division.

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">When “Brig Gen” James Gatwech Reath was asked by CTSAMVM whether he
was getting support from any Party or from anywhere, he answered using a local
proverb that “when a lion is going to roar, it has to find a firm base where to
stand”.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">This proverb was an acceptance by “Brig Gen” Gatwech that indeed his
forces together with the White Army were supported.

Assessment

22.Based on the statements of the various witnesses interviewed, CTSAMVM
assesses that:</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">

a.    Attack on SPLM/A-IO positions in Maiwut County.</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">It was confirmed
that the SPLM/A-IO positions in Maiwut County at Jekau, Wangkuerbiy,
Kuerkeem and LolNyang were attacked and overrun on 20 Mar 22.

b.     Basing on the statement of “Brig Gen” James Gatwech Ruth, to have
got support, the type of weapons used and the presence of the Maiwut
County Commissioner together with Maj Gen James Ochan in Jekou
Barracks after the fighting, it is assessed that SSPDF appears to have
supported the White Army to attack and overrun Jekou.

Gi     Brig Gen James Gatwech Reath owned up leading civilians to attack
Jekou using only AK-47 rifles thus contradicting Brig Gen Wal Deng
Ador's version that the civilians attacked Jekou using a variety of heavy
weapons including RPGs, PKMs and 12.1 mm.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">The two commanders
made contradicting versions of the  weapons used to attack and
overrun Jekou with a view to exonerate SSPDF from direct involvement
in the Jekou incident.

Cc.     </a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">Access.</a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">The Maiwut County Commissioner together with “Brig Gen”
James Gatwech deliberately denied CTSAMVM access to both Jekou
and Wangkuerbiy.

d.    Causes of the conflict.</a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">Among other factors, the conflict in Maiwut is
assessed to have been caused by the alleged disagreement between
the government's County Commissioner and the   SPLM/A-IO
Commanders plus defections from SPLM/A-IO ranks.

f.      The County Commissioner of Maiwut (ITGONU) seemed to admit that
he knows more about the attack on SPLM/A-IO positions on 20 Mar 22,
when he stated that, the events that led to the 20 Mar 22 attacks on
the SPLM/A-IO positions started from when he took over office as
Commissioner in May 2021 and the SPLM/A-IO refused movement
of civilians from Jekau, Turu to go to Maiwut.

g.     Torture allegations.</a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">The allegations of torture of civilians could not be
confirmed because CTSAMVM was unable to meet any civilian victims.
</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">CTSAMVM team was informed that the NGO workers who  were
tortured had been taken to Ethiopia for treatment.

h.     The massive displacement of civilians from their homes to cross the
boarder to Ethiopia was caused by the fighting in Jekou.

Conclusion

23.</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that SPLM/A-IO positions in Maiwut County at
Jekau, Wangkuerbiy, Kuerkeem and LolNyang were attacked and overrun on
20 Mar 22 by the SSPDF aligned forces of “Brig Gen” James Gatwech, the Turu
Declaration Chairman together with the Maiwut County Commissioner and most
likely to have been supported by Maj Gen James Ochan Puot and Maj Gen
James Khor Chuol Giet, in violation of Article 2.0.4  and 2.1-10.0  of the R-ARCSS
and Article  2) (a) and (d) of the ACoH.

SPLM/A-IO Barracks at Yambura and Wangkuerbiy on 09 Jan 22 to revenge for
their soldiers who were allegedly killed by SPLM/A-IO forces is a clear violation of
the R-ARCSS Articles 2.0.2, 2.1.9, 2.2.10.0.

Recommendations

27.</a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">The Maiwut County Commissioner, Maj Gen James Ochan Puot, “Brig Gen”
James Gatwech Reath, Brig Gen Wal Deng Ador (SSPDF Bde 18 Comd) be held
accountable for the incidents in Maiwut, and Longechuk Counties.

28.</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">The SPLM/A-IO is equally responsible for the death of SSPDF soldiers, namely
Pte Marko Okil Salvatore Lomin on 15 Jan 22, Pte Nicola Lado Otongo Micheal
