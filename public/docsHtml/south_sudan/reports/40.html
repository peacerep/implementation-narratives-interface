CTSAMVM REPORT 2022/23
RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING IN NORTHER BAHR EL GHAZAL STATE
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
CTSAMVM received allegations from a number of sources that young people were
being recruited by the SSPDF and trained at Mathiang Barracks in Aweil.</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">There
were allegations that some of those recruited were under-age.
</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">The SSPDF claimed that those being trained in Mathiang Barracks were “deserters”
who were being called back into the army and given refresher training before being
deployed where necessary.</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">However, one SSPDF officer said that “volunteers” were
accepted at the barracks for training but did not count as recruits because they were
not registered.</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">An official said that some of those being trained were former
members of the Mathiang Anyor militia.
</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">There is a long-standing problem with unemployed young people in Aweil who are
facing poverty and lack of opportunities.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">It is seen by some that absorption into the
military at least gives them something to do as well as food and clothing.
</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">CTSAMVM obtained first-hand witness testimony that young people had at least
been accepted as “volunteers” by the SSPDF in Mathiang Barracks, and received
military training and uniforms.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">CTSAMVM was unable to obtain sufficient evidence to prove that the SSPDF has
accepted Child Soldiers at Mathiang Barracks, although two were identified and
dismissed in July 2022.
</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">It is the assessment of CTSAMVM that by accepting “volunteers” at Mathiang
Barracks in Aweil the SSPDF has acted in clear violation of the R-ARCSS, and
increased the level of militarisation in Northern Bahr el Ghazal State.

INTRODUCTION
1. Background

a. Mathiang Barracks is in Aweil municipality.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">It is about  Km west of the
town itself and comes under the command of  Division SSPDF in Wunyiik.

b. Prior to the signing of the R-ARCSS young men were recruited in Northern
Bahr el Ghazal and Warrap states and — according to what CTSAMVM has
been told — trained in Pantit for what was known as the Mathiang Anyor
militia.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">The Mathiang Anyor was deployed under the command of the SPLA
(as it was then) in Central Equatoria State (amongst other areas) and was
responsible for violations on the ARCSS and ACOH:</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">CTSAMM (as it was
then) submitted  violation reports between March 2017 and April 2018
concerning in whole or in part the activities of the Mathiang Anyor.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">One of
them was specifically about the employment of Child Soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">There is
recent history in Northern Bahr el Ghazal of the recruitment and
employment of young people in the military.

</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">c. There is a long-standing issue in Norther Bahr el Ghazal with unemployed
young people — some orphans — who roam the streets of Aweil in gangs and
cause problems.

2. Allegations:</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">

a. On 18 July 2022 CTSAMVM was told by the UNMISS Child Protection Unit
of concerns about alleged child soldier recruitment and training in Mathiang
Barracks.

b. CTSAMVM made some initial enquiries and was told by a variety of other
sources that training was taking place Mathiang Barracks, and that young
people were involved.

<p><a id="24" name="24">Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">
The aim of this report is to present the findings of CTSAMVM investigations into
alleged or suspected violations of provisions of applicable agreements, to
attribute responsibility for breaches of the agreements, and to make
recommendations with regard to compliance actions that will help foster peace
and reconciliation.

<p><a id="26" name="26">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">

a. The investigations were undertaken with the full participation of two National

<p><a id="28" name="28">There was not an SSPDF National Monitor available to the team
during the investigations as he was away in Juba.

b. During the period from  September to 21 October 2022 the CTSAMVM
Monitoring and Verification Team (MVT) based in Aweil met with a total of
21 local witnesses, including:</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">

‘ a,
d. The standard of proof used by CTSAMVM to determine whether there is
sufficient evidence to verify that a Party is not in compliance with the
provisions of the Agreements is “reasonable grounds to believe that the
incident that is the subject of the investigation occurred.”</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">This is in
accordance with accepted practice for monitoring mechanisms and human-
rights- and humanitarian- entities and signifies that sufficient facts and
evidence have been collected to conclude that an event has occurred.

FINDINGS
1. SSPDF:</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">

a. The commander of Mathiang Barracks, Lt Col Garang Garang Ngor,
said there are 460 soldiers stationed there including 38 female soldiers.
</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">He said they were ex-soldiers from SSPDF  Division and 16 and 17
Brigades.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">He also said that some looked young but that was
characteristic of South Sudanese who have an inadequate diet.

b. One of the officers at Mathiang Barracks told CTSAMVM that the
soldiers in the barracks were there for refresher training in order to be
ready to deploy to military units when necessary.

</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">c. The Commander of  Division SSPDF was not in barracks when
CTSAMVM visited.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">However, the MVT met with the Chief of Operations
and the Adjutant, who said that  Division does not have the power to
recruit soldiers;</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">recruitment is done at the strategic level.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">He also said
that  Division has had forces in Mathiang Barracks for some years to
ensure a quick response in Aweil town if necessary.

d. CTSAMVM met with the Brigadier who is the Chief Instructor at Pantit
Training Centre and also responsible for all military training in Northern
Bahr el Ghazal State.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">He said:</a></p>

i. There are three categories of soldiers at Mathiang Barracks:</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">
1. Ex-soldiers/deserters undergoing refresher training.
</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">2. ‘Reinforcements’ from  Division SSPDF send to Aweil in
case they are needed.
</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">3. “New volunteers”.

ii, That there are large numbers of unemployed young men in
Aweil who are facing hardship, and that if he has the budget to
take in such young men and train them he would do so in order
to improve their lives.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">He confirmed that “new volunteers” do
sometimes come to Mathiang Barracks but those who joined
were not recruited per se because they are neither registered
nor paid.

</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">•. CTSAMVM observed that the female soldiers they met at Mathiang
Barracks appeared to be in their early 20’s at the most, and did not
look like ex-soldiers who had returned for refresher training.

2. State Government and authorities:</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">

a. CTSAMVM met with two state ministers, who both said that the
“growing number” of soldiers in Mathiang Barracks is not due to the
recruitment of street children as has been alleged.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">They said that they
were soldiers as young as 24 who had “abandoned camp” in 2018 and
had been called up by the SSPDF for refresher training in order to
inculcate them with military discipline prior to integration in military
units.

b. The Director of Gender, Child and Social Welfare told CTSAMVM that
there had been allegations of the recruitment of Child Soldiers at
Mathiang Barracks since July 2022, and that officials from the Ministry
visited the barracks in October 2022 and found no Child Soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">A
ministry official told CTSAMVM that a letter had been written by the
Director to the Governor to tell  Division SSPDF not to recruit children;</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">
this had_led to a visit to the Mathiang Barracks.

    </a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">pve |
c. The Chairperson of the DDR commission said that he had visited
Mathiang Barracks on 24 September 2022 together with UNMISS Child
Protection Unit officers.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">He went on to say that in 2015/2016 “a group
called Mathiang Anyor” had been recruited and trained in Pantit but
had since been abolished (see paragraph 1b above), and it was
members of this group who were undergoing refresher training.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">He said
that he had seen “children” in military uniform in Aweil, but the
commander of Mathiang Barracks told him that these would have got
the uniforms from family members.

d.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">The Chairperson of the Northern Bahr el Ghazal Relief and
Rehabilitation Commission said that the issue of the growing number of
“street children” in Aweil needs to be addressed with humanitarian
intervention or vocational training, because poverty is pushing them
into enlisting in the army.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">He said that the soldiers from Mathiang
Barracks can be seen running in the morning and everybody knows
about ongoing recruitment:</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">“you can ask anyone in the town, it’s not a
secret”.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">He also said that 383 soldiers were trained and “graduated” in
August 2022 and that 400 soldiers are currently undergoing training.

3. UNMISS Child Protection Unit (CPU):
CTSAMVM met with the CPU Team Leader who said the CPU visited’
</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">Mathiang Barracks on 24 September 2022:</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">

a. The team saw 75 soldiers on parade, one of whom looked visibly
young although it was proved he has 25 years old.

b. They found that in July 2022 there were two under-age soldiers at
Mathiang Barracks, and showed CTSAMVM a letter signed by the
Child Protection Coordinator at  Division SSPDF dismissing the boys
from the barracks.

4. Civil Society:</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">
CTSAMVM engaged with the leadership and members of a wide range of
Civil Society and religious organisations as listed above.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">A summary of
finding from these groups is as follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">

a. Most of those spoken to by CTSAMVM emphasised that there is a lot
of poverty and unemployment in Aweil, and it is this that drives young
people to join the army at Mathiang Barracks.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">There were also
numerous reports that soldiers are seen running in squads in the
morning.

b. One witness told CTSAMVM that her 18-year-old nephew left school
and volunteered to join the Army at Mathiang Barracks.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">When his
mother went to try and get him to return to school she found him with 
other boys of about the same age or younger.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">The witness said that
the boys were not paid, but given food, training and uniforms.

</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">c. A religious leader said that he was saddened to see “children aged
14/15/16" in uniform.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">He said he saw  coming out of Mathiang
Barracks who he claimed were 15/16 years old.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">Another religious
leader said that “...these street children cannot support themselves
and end up joining the military [Mathiang Barracks] that provides them
with their basic needs”.

d. One witness said a colleague of his in his 30’s had volunteered and
joined the army and he knew of another woman who had also done so.

</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">•. Members of a religious group said that their “neighbours and relatives”
have joined the training at Mathiang Barracks.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">They also said that
“women are enlisting because they are widows, and children are
enlisting because they are orphans”.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">They again said that volunteers
received no salary.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">They gave the names of two women who had
recently enlisted, one in her 30’s and the other was 20, and said that
“children as young as 15-17 and 20-year-old adults are enlisting”.

ASSESSMENT

1.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">CTSAMVM was given contradictory information by the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">However, the
SSPDF clearly stated that it has been calling people who had previously
been in the army to return and receive refresher training.

2.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">It is the assessment of CTSAMVM that the SSPDF has been accepting
‘volunteers’, young people who have joined the Army at Mathiang Barracks.
</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">CTSAMVM has eye-witness testimony that some of these volunteers are too
young to have ever been in the army prior to the signing of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">It
is also evident that these young people have received training.

3. CTSAMVM has been unable to substantiate allegations of Child Soldiers
being in Mathiang Barracks, although it has seen evidence (the letter from
the  Division Child Protection Coordinator) that there were at least two child
soldiers prior to July 2022.

4.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">There are very few opportunities for young people in Aweil.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">Many face
poverty and hardship, and, even if they are not paid, volunteering for the
army means they are at least fed and clothed.

CONCLUSIONS

1.CTSAMVM concludes that:</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">
By accepting and training volunteers in Mathiang Barracks the SSPDF is acting in
violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically article 2.1.8:</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">“All Parties agree to cease security
forces recruitment and the training of late recruits”.
</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">The Parties were supposed to declare all forces after the signing of the
R-ARCSS in.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">To increase the number of forces above those which were
declared, either by recruitment or the training of “volunteers” goes against the
spirit and word of the Agreement.

2. CTSAMVM is concerned by claims by the DDR Commissioner that former
members of the Mathiang Anyor have been or are being re-trained at Mathiang
Barracks.

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">There is no doubt that young people face poverty and lack of opportunities in
Aweil.</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">However, providing them with military training may create problems in
the future by further militarising society, especially when the military in South
Sudan faces so many challenges in creating a suitably-sized professional army.
