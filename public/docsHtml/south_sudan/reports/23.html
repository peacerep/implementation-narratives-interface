Executive Summary 

</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">This report on the status of implementation of the Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of 
the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) has been prepared pursuant to article 7.9 
of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">The report covers the period from 1 October to 31 December 2022 and builds on 
the previous quarterly Reports Nos. 001/19 - 016/22.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">It provides a status update on implementation 
of the thematic chapters of the R-ARCSS during the reporting period and since the approval of a 
Roadmap extending the Transitional Period from end-February 2023 to end-February 2025, with 
elections to be held in December 2024.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">During  the  quarter,  the  Transitional  National  Legislature  (TNL)  considered  and  passed  the 
National Police Service Bill, the SSPDF Bill, the Wildlife Service Bill, the National Police Service 
Bill, the Political Parties Bill, and the Constitution-making Process Bill.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">In December 2022, H.E. 
President Salva Kiir assented to the following six bills into law:</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">the Constitution-making Process 
Bill 2022, the Transitional Constitution  of the Republic of South  Sudan 2011 (Amendment) Bill 
No.11,  2022,  the  National  Police  Service  Act,  2009  (Amendment)  </a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">Bill  2022,  the  National  Civil 
Defence Service Bill 2022, National Prisons Service Act, 2011 (Amendment) Bill 2022 and the 
National Wildlife Service Act 2011</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">(Amendment) Bill 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">The  Permanent  Ceasefire  largely  continued  to  hold,  but  was  severely  strained  by  violence 
mainly between Lt Gen Simon Gatwech and Lt Gen Johnson Olony’s Agwelek forces in Upper 
Nile State.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Lt Gen Johnson Olony’s forces also attacked South Sudan Peoples’ Liberation Army – 
</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">In Opposition (SPLA-IO) Cantonment Sites in Jonglei State.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">The situation deteriorated further as 
armed Nuer Youth, from Jonglei State clashed with the Agwelek forces, and later launched several 
attacks  on  Shulluk  communities  in  Upper  Nile,  prompting  a  response  from  the    Shulluk  armed 
youth.  </a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">Tension was also high in Maiwut County of Upper Nile due to alleged clashes between 
SSPDF forces commanded by Lt Gen Ochan and forces of the  SPLA-IO Division 5.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">Although cases of SGBV by uniformed forces have reduced since the instituting of the SSPDF 
District Court Martials in 2020, RJMEC continues to receive  CTSAMVM reports of rape cases 
allegedly committed by some within the armed forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">However, the SSPDF has been convening 
both  General  and  District  Court  Martials  to  conduct  trials  of    soldiers  who  committed  crimes 
against civilians including SGBV, murder, looting, harassment,  etc, as well as cases of military 
indiscipline, resulting in the conviction of some 42 individuals.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">

</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">The ongoing sub national and intercommunal conflict taking place in Upper Nile and Jonglei 
continues to deter humanitarian partners from delivering life-saving assistance to thousands in need 
and has forced partners to halt interventions and relocate staff to safer locations, while humanitarian 
facilities were vandalized and supplies looted.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">This all contributed to  a worsening humanitarian 
situation with UNOCHA warning that an estimated 9.4 million people in South Sudan will need 
urgent life-saving assistance and protection in 2023, compared to 8.9 million in 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">At the same 
time violence against humanitarian workers is on the rise with one worker killed in the quarter, 
bringing to 9 the number killed during 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">A  key  aspect  of  resources  management  outlined  in  Chapter  4  is  aimed  at  enhancing 
transparency and accountability in the handling of the country’s resources, and reforms to achieve 
transparency and accountability in the public sector are ongoing.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">In that regard, the National Audit 
Chamber’s laws to guarantee its independence have been drafted and resources provided to enable 
it to carry out its functions without political interference.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">At the same time, the Audit Chamber is 
reviewing  government financial statements for the period 2011 to 2014, which have been provided 
by the Ministry of Finance and Planning.  

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">iii 

In this reporting period the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs (MoJCA) is in the 
process  of  drafting  the  Commission  on  Truth  Reconciliation  and  Healing  (CTRH)  </a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">Bill  and  the 
Compensation and Reparation (CRA) Bill.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">The drafting of these Bills should be legally informed 
by public consultations undertaken with stakeholders as provided for by article 5.2.1.3 of the R-
ARCSS and country study tours undertaken by the MoJCA in South Africa and The Gambia.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">

</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">The RJMEC Chairperson addressed the IGAD Council of Ministers, the African Union Peace 
and  Security  Council  (AUPSC),  and  the  United  Nations  Security  Council  (UNSC)  during  the 
quarter with a focus on fast-tracking of the peace process in South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">The engagement with 
the IGAD Council of Ministers took place on 30 November 2022 during its 48th Ordinary Session 
in Kharthoum, the same day on which the AUPSC meeting was held, while the engagement with 
the UNSC took  place on 13 December 2022, during  which critical  decisions were taken with  a 
focus on facilitating progress in the peace process in accordance with the new RTGoNU Roadmap 
Towards Peaceful and Democratic Elections at the end of the Transitional Period (Roadmap).</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">Overall, the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity (RTGoNU) has continued 
to implement the Revitalized Agreement with its main priority on setting the stage for completing 
the tasks identified within the Roadmap.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">This included the passage of key pieces of legislation, 
particularly the Permanent Constitution Making Process Bill, and setting the basis for reorganising 
the security sector with the graduation of Phase I of the NUF.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">Importantly, as provided for under 
article 1.19 of the R-ARCSS, the parties to the R-ARCSS initiated the process and agreed on the 
number of Commissions and Institutions to be restructured and reconstituted at the national level. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">These  include  the  all  important  National  Constitutional  Review  Commission  (NCRC)  and  the 
National Election Commission (NEC), two critical commissions needed to oversee the constitution 
making process and the elections respectively.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">Of critical concern is also the increasing intercommunal conflicts which risk reversing the hard 
earned gains realised thus far with the implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">The fact that thousands of 
persons  continue  to  be  displaced  and  hundreds  killed  simply  diminishes  the  value  of  the  peace 
dividends.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">An important aspect of addressing this problem is with the redeployment of the NUF 
and  a  serious  campaign  of  civilian  disarmament.  </a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">This  task  takes  on  an  added  urgency  as  the 
attention begins to be focused on preparations for next year’s elections.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">

</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">With a clear focus on the remaining two years of the Transitional Period, and also to encourage 
adherence to the implementation of the benchmarks provided in the R-ARCSS, including schedules 
in  the Roadmap, the report offers the following  recommendations to  the Agreement institutions 
and mechanisms, RTGoNU, TNLA, and IGAD.

Introduction 

1.       </a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">This  report  on  the  status  of  implementation  of  the  Revitalised  Agreement  on  the 
Resolution  of  the  Conflict  in  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan  (R-ARCSS)  has  been  prepared 
pursuant  to  article  7.9  of  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">The  report  covers  the  period  from  1  October  to  31 
December 2022 and builds on the previous quarterly Reports Nos. 001/19 - 016/22.1</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">It provides 
a status update on implementation of the thematic chapters of the R-ARCSS during the reporting 
period  and  since  the  approval  of  a  Roadmap  extending  the  Transitional  Period  from  end-
February 2023 to end-February 2025, with elections to be held in December 2024.2  </a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">It concludes 
with  recommendations  to  the  Revitalized  Transitional  Government  of  National  Unity 
(RTGoNU), the Transitional National Legislature (TNL), the Partners and Stakeholders to R-
ARCSS, and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the guarantors to the 
Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">  
2.      </a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">During the quarter, H.E Salva Kiir Mayardit, President of the Republic of South Sudan 
assented to four bills including the Constitution-making Process Bill 2022, which initiated the 
process of framing a permanent constitution for South Sudan, a key requirement for the holding 
of  elections.  </a></p>
<p><a id="136" name="136">Some  progress  was  also  made  towards  completing  Phase  1  of  the  unification 
process with the graduation of over 49 000 unified forces, who are expected to play a key role 
in maintaining security in the lead up to elections.</a></p>
<p><a id="137" name="137">However, the security situation was seriously 
undermined  with  repeated  clashes  in  Upper  Nile  and  the  Greater  Pibor  Administrative  Area 
related to intercommunal disputes around cattle raiding and abductions.</a></p>
<p><a id="138" name="138">At the same time the 
humanitarian  situation  in  the  country  continued  to  worsen  due  to,  among  others,  flooding, 
localised drought, humanitarian access constraints, and public health challenges.</a></p>
<p><a id="139" name="139">  
3.     Having  identified  the  challenges  facing  the  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS,  and  in  an 
attempt to further improve the pace of implementation of the Agreement, the Interim RJMEC 
Chairperson regularly engaged  RTGoNU, TNL,  Agreement institutions and mechanisms  and 
the  other  Parties  to  the Agreement,  stakeholders  and  adherents.  </a></p>
<p><a id="140" name="140">The  leadership  also  engaged 
with the IGAD Council of Ministers, the African Union Peace and Security Council (AUPSC), 
and the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), during which the fast-tracking of the peace 
process in the Republic of South Sudan was made top of the agenda.</a></p>
<p><a id="141" name="141">Consequently, following 
the IGAD Council of Ministers (COM) meeting there were critical resolutions made concerning 
implementation of the R-ARCSS including the need to undertake a joint ministerial visit to Juba 
and hold a bi-annual Extraordinary IGAD Council of Ministers.  
4.       </a></p>
<p><a id="142" name="142">This  report  has  four  sections  and  is  structured  as  follows.  </a></p>
<p><a id="143" name="143">Section  I,  the  introduction, 
provides  an  overview  of  the  entire  report  and  highlights  the  main  issues  addressed.  </a></p>
<p><a id="144" name="144">This  is 
followed  by  Section  II,  which  provides  an  analysis  of  the  status  of  implementation  of  the 
thematic  chapters  of  the  R-ARCSS  to  include,  including  governance,  security,  humanitarian 
affairs,  economic  affairs,  and  legal  and  constitutional  affairs;</a></p>
<p><a id="145" name="145"> </a></p>
<p><a id="146" name="146">as  well  as  the  activities  of  the

<p><a id="177" name="177">Regarding the reforms to relevant national legislation to conform to the provisions of the 
R-ARCSS,  including  international  best  practices,  the  National  Constitutional  Amendment 
Committee (NCAC) has continued to make significant progress in the reviews, amendment and 
drafting of legislation during the quarter.</a></p>
<p><a id="178" name="178">Overall, within this reporting period, the Committee 
completed  the  review of  the National  Elections  Act,  2012 and  the Southern  Sudan  Anti- 
Corruption Commission Act,  2009 and  submitted  the respective Bills  to  the  Minister  of 
Justice and  Constitutional  Affairs on  24 November  2022.  </a></p>
<p><a id="179" name="179">It  also  commenced  the  review  of 
the National Revenue Authority Act 2016;</a></p>
<p><a id="180" name="180">the Banking Act, 2012 and the Bank of South Sudan 
Act,  2011  and  subsequently  reviewed  and  drafted  amendment  bills  for  all  of  them,  pending 
submission  to  the  Minister  of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Affairs.  </a></p>
<p><a id="181" name="181">The  Committee  has  also 
initiated the review of the Non-Governmental Organizations Act, 2016 and has scheduled the 
experts meeting on the same for 24 January 2023. 
11.  </a></p>
<p><a id="182" name="182">Pursuant  to  the  R-ARCSS,  the  reviewed  electoral  law  includes  radical  changes  to  the 
existing  legislation  to  ensure  that  its  provisions  conform  with  international  best  practices 
concerning  the  conduct  of  free,  fair  elections,  including  the  independence  of  the  National 
Elections Commission, among others.</a></p>
<p><a id="183" name="183">The amendment of the electoral law was also to ensure 
that  several  processes  necessary  for  the  elections,  including  elections  petitions,  setting  up 
polling centres, and timelines for publishing voter registers are improved.  
12.  </a></p>
<p><a id="184" name="184">However,  there  were  delays  in  the  submission  of  the  draft  bill  by  the  NCAC  to  the 
Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs due to a lack of consensus among the Committee 
members  regarding  representation  of  various  interest  groups  in  the  reconstituted  National 
Elections Commission, particularly those related to the reserved lists for political parties (15%) 
and women (35%) (articles 60, 61 and 63 of the Bill).</a></p>
<p><a id="185" name="185">The youth and civil society representatives 
proposed amendments to the Bill which would result in substantial changes to the provision of 
National Elections Act 2012.</a></p>

was severely strained by violence mainly between Lt Gen Simon Gatwech4 and Lt Gen Johnson 
Olony’s Agwelek forces in Upper Nile State, especially in Panyikang, Malakal, and Fashoda 
Counties.</a></p>
<p><a id="207" name="207">Lt Gen Johnson Olony’s forces also attacked South Sudan Peoples’ Liberation Army

‘white army5’ from Jonglei State clashed with the Agwelek forces, and later launched several 
attacks on Shilluk communities in Upper Nile, prompting a response from the  Shilluk armed 
youth.  </a></p>
<p><a id="210" name="210">6  The  ‘white  army’  also  reportedly  attacked  several  communities  in  the  Greater  Pibor 
Administrative Area during December.</a></p>

<p><a id="213" name="213">Monitoring  and  Verification

to  the  lack  of  rotary  air  transportation  since  withdrawal  of  the  United  States  Government’s 
support to their operations in July 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="214" name="214">As an alternative, CTSAMVM requested special flights 
support from  UNMISS and the requests are still under consideration.</a></p>
<p><a id="215" name="215">CTSAMVM could  not 
access the areas affected by the violence due to floods, hence the need for air transportation.  
18.  </a></p>
<p><a id="216" name="216">During the fourth quarter, National Salvation Front (NAS) activities were reported mostly 
in  Central  Equatoria,  and  mainly  attacks  on  soft  targets  such  as  the  civilian  population  and

<p><a id="409" name="409">and    urged  member  states  to  provide  political,  technical,  and  logistical  support  to  the 
Revitalised  Transitional  Government  for  the  implementation  of  the  priority  areas  of  the 
Roadmap,  including  the  DDR  process,  the  Permanent  Constitutionmaking  process,  and 
elections.12 13

<p><a id="410" name="410">During the reporting period the RJMEC leadership continously engaged the RTGoNU 
and the various institutions and mechanisms of  the R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="411" name="411">In particular, the RTGoNU 
was  encouraged  to  adhere  to  the  Roadmap  timelines,  ensure  women’s  participation  in 
governance and decision-making at the Agreement-mandated level of 35% in all governance-
related tasks and appointments and also consider  the Youth and People Living with Disabilities;</a></p>

                                        Observations 

61.  </a></p>
<p><a id="417" name="417">Overall, the RTGoNU has continued to implement the Revitalized Agreement with its 
main priority focus on setting the stage for completing the tasks identified within the Roadmap. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="418" name="418">This included the passage of key pieces of legislation, particularly the Permanent Constitution 
Making Process Bill, and setting up the security infrastructure with the graduation of Phase I 
of the NUF.</a></p>
<p><a id="419" name="419">Importantly, as provided for under article 1.19 of the R-ARCSS, the parties to the 
R-ARCSS initiated the process and agreed on the number of Commissions and Institutions to 
be restructured and reconstituted at the national level.</a></p>
<p><a id="420" name="420">These include the all important NCRC 
and the NEC, two critical commissions needed to oversee the constitution making process and 
the elections respectively.  
62.  </a></p>
<p><a id="421" name="421">The ongoing intercommunal conflict risks reversing the hard earned gains realsied thus 
far with the implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="422" name="422">The fact that thousands of persons continue to 
be  displaced  and  hundreds  killed  simply  diminishes  the  value  of  the  peace  dividends.  </a></p>
<p><a id="423" name="423">An 
important aspect of addressing this problem is with the deployment of the NUF and a serious 
campaign of civilian disarmament.</a></p>
<p><a id="424" name="424">This task takes on an added urgency as the attention begins 
to be focused on preparations for next year’s elections.  
63. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="425" name="425">In  a  similar  manner,  the  ongoing  dire  humanitarian  situation  have  denied  millions  of 
South Sudanese the opportunity to benefit from the ongoing implementation of the R-ARCSS. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="426" name="426">The  current  humanitarian  needs  can  however  be  relieved  through  concerted  funding  and 
intervention  efforts  from  RTGoNU,  humanitarian  and  development  partners  as  well  as 
lifesaving interventions for those on the brink.  </a></p>
<p><a id="427" name="427">In that regard, RJMEC continues to urge the 
RTGoNU to provide improved services to its citizens and establish the Special Reconstruction 
Fund (SRF) to avail funding for relief and reconstruction efforts.</a></p>

<p><a id="457" name="457">Conclusion 

65. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="458" name="458">The RTGoNU Roadmap is the current blue print to ensure that the pursuit of peace in 
South Sudan continues.</a></p>
<p><a id="459" name="459">However, the next several months will prove pivotal in ensuring that 
this momentum carries through to the holding of peaceful and credible elections in December 
2024.  </a></p>
<p><a id="460" name="460">In  particular,  expeditious  progress  must  be  made  in  the  drafting  of  the  permanent 
constitution,  reforming  the  judicial  system,  enacting  key  reforms  in  the  financial  sector  and 
ensuring the  complete unification and  redeployment  of  the NUF throughout  the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="461" name="461">All 
these tasks, in order to be completed require demonstrable political will and predictable levels 
of resources.</a></p>
<p><a id="462" name="462">In addition, efforts must continue to curb intercommunal conflict and support the 
dignified return of refugees and IDPs to their homes.</a></p>
<p><a id="463" name="463">It is critically important that the regional 
and  international  community  including  IGAD,  the  AU  and  the  UN  as  well  as  the  donor 
community continue to support the ongoing peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="464" name="464">  
66.  </a></p>
<p><a id="465" name="465">On its part and pursuant to its mandate as provided for in Chapter 7 of the R-ARCSS, the 
RJMEC  will  continue  to  monitor,  evaluate,  report  on  the  status  of  implementation  of  the  R-
ARCSS,  as  circumstances  demand,  intervene  to  break  any  deadlock  that  may  emerge  in  the 
course of implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="466" name="466">It will regularly provide reports and briefings to the RTGoNU, the 
reconstituted  TNLA,  the  Chairperson  of  the  IGAD  Assembly  of  Heads  of  State  and 
Government, the Chairperson of the IGAD Council of Ministers, the Chairperson of the African 
Union Commission, the Peace and Security Council of the African Union and to the Secretary 
General of the United Nations and the Security Council of the United Nations.</a></p>
