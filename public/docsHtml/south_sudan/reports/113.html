CTSAMVM REPORT 2022/01
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
On night of 22 August 2021 a group of armed men entered the UNHCR Refugee
Camp at Nyori which was occupied by refugees from DRC and South Sudanese
IDPs.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">The civilian occupants were attacked and during the incident a girl of 12 years
was raped.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">Civilian dwellings were destroyed and there was extensive looting.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">Following the attack civilians were forced to carry the looted property from Nyori to
Zubare payam.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">As a result of the attack 40 households were displaced and have
taken shelter in DRC.
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">CTSAMVM attributes the responsibility for the attacks to the NAS component of
SSOMA led by Thomas Cirillo.
</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that by perpetrating a raid against Nyori IDP camp
on the night of 22/23 August 2021, NAS forces failed to discharge their obligations to
the ACOH of 17 December 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">In so doing the NAS have violated the agreement,
specifically:</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">Article Three Sub Para  and Article Four Sub Para 2.

<p><a id="19" name="19">i
ATTACK, RAPE AND ABDUCTION OF CIVILIANS AT NYORI
Introduction
1. Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">

a. NAS is a non-signatory of the R-ARCSS, however NAS did sign the ACOH of
December 2017 and remains bound by it.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">Since the signing of the ACOH
CTSAMVM has submitted 12 reports attributing responsibility for violations of
the ACOH to NAS out of a total of 57 reports.

b. In 2020 incidents allegedly involving NAS continued, despite the cessation of
hostilities that formed part of the Rome Declaration.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">CTSAMVM should have
had SSOMA National Monitors incorporated within it, but due to, among other
things, a split within the SSOMA the Rome Declaration and its follow-on
Resolutions, which call for SSOMA representation at all echelons of the
CTSAMVM, have yet to be fully implemented, though the discussions that are
part of the Declaration continue.

c. Allegations:</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">

i. On 23 August 2021 CTSAMVM received information from what is known
as the SSPDF Mobile Unit in Lasu that at around midnight on 22/23
August alleged NAS “rebels” had attacked the UNHCR Refugee Camp
at Nyori.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">During the attack a young girl was reportedly raped, medicines
looted from a UNHCR medical centre and good/belongings stolen from
the South Sudanese IDP inhabitants of the Refugee Camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">It was
further alleged that civilians from the Nyori Refugee Camp camp were
forced to carry the looted property into the bush.

ii, Lasu is southwest of Yei town, close to the border with DRC.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">Nyori is
about 3.8  km west of Lasu.             </a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">a

2. Aim</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">:</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">The aim of this report is to present the findings of CTSAMVM investigations
into alleged or suspected violations of provisions of applicable agreemen, to
attribute responsibility for breaches of the agreements where applicable, and to
make recommendations with regard to compliance actions that will help foster
peace and reconciliation.

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">

a. CTSAMVM conducted four visits to Nyori and one visit to contacts in Yei in
order to investigate the allegations:</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">

i.  September 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">Lasu and Nyori:</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">CTSAMVM met with the SSPDF
unit commander at Lasu, and several civilian witnesses including an
SGBV counsellor.

ii.  </a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">September 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">Yei:</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">Visits to medical authorities in Yel, and also to
the Chief Inspector of Police.

iii.  </a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">September 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">Nyori:</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">CTSAMVM interviewed the rape victim with
her mother, and other civilian witnesses.

iv.  </a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">October 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">Nyori:</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">CTSAMVM met the Chairperson of the Nyori
Refugee camp and two other civilian witnesses who had been present
during the attack.

v. 22 November 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">Nyori.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">CTSAMVM interviewed  further civilian
witnesses at the Nyori Refugee Camp.

b. The standard of proof used by CTSAMVM to determine whether there is
sufficient evidence to verify that a Party is not in compliance with the
provisions of the Agreements is “reasonable grounds to believe that the
incident that is the subject of the investigation occurred.”</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">This is in
accordance with accepted practice for monitoring mechanisms and human
rights and humanitarian entities and signifies that sufficient facts and
evidence have been collected to conclude that an event has occurred.

</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">c. National Monitors were involved throughout the investigation.

Findings                                    -

4. UNHCR operates the Nyori Refugee Camp, which was established in 2009 to
support refugees from the DRC.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">The camp is occupied by refugees from DRC
and also South Sudanese IDPs seeking refuge from the violence and deprivation
caused by internal armed conflict.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">At about midnight on 22/23 August 2021 a
large group of armed men entered the camp and attacked the civilian occupants.
</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">CTSAMVM was unable to get any accurate estimates of the number of
assailants;</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">one witness said “about 400” but it was at night and so it is not
possible to confirm how many were involved.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">All witnesses described the
attackers as being armed and well organised and noted that some of them were
in uniform.

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">The attack caused fear and insecurity in the refugee camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">First-hand witness
statements refer to beatings and threats that were perpetrated upon residents by
the assailants during the incident.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">The armed men ordered the IDP camp
residents “to move out of the camp in  days or they would return and burn down
their tukuls”.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">A large amount of property was stolen and removed, including
household goods and money.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">One witness described how his door was broken
down and how he and his wife were forced out whilst the attackers moved in and
stole clothes, food and all their money (in this case 120,000 SSP).</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">There were
multiple accounts of similar activities throughout the camp during the incident.

6.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">A list of stolen items compiled after the incident includes 18 solar panels, 62
mobile telephones, 14 radios, 15 goats, uncounted quantities of clothes and
bedding, and cash to the value of about $,000 in SSP, USD and other Foreign
Currency.

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">The medical centre in the camp was looted;</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">equipment and medicines were
taken.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">Agirl of 12 years was raped.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Armed men broke into her family’s house where she
was with her mother and four siblings.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">They looted the house and slapped the
mother and the other children, before selecting the victim and taking her outside.
</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">She was raped by a man who said he was doing it because she went to school in
Lasu near to the SSPDF camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">The victim was ci Yei Civil Hospital

/One Stop Center, where she received appropriate medical treatment and
psychosocial support /counselling.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">She was discharged after  days.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">The rape
was also confirmed by the SGBV Counsellor at the UNCHR Nyori Refugee
Camp.

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">Anumber of civilians from the camp were forced to carry looted property from the
IDP camp about 14 kms northwest towards Ombugi Mountain in Zubare Payam.
</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">CTSAMVM interviewed witnesses who were amongst those abducted in this way.
</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">There were about 58, including school children, youths and at least  women:</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">
they were all released and returned to Nyori.

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">As a result of this incident about 40 households left the Nyori camp and moved
across the border to refugee camps in the DRC.

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">Concerning the identity of the attackers:</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">

a. According to witnesses interviewed, NAS are known to have a base in this
area.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">The attackers came from the direction of Zubare Payam where
witnesses state that NAS forces are based.

b. There are no SSPDF units in Zubare Payam.

</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">c. The SSPDF commander in Lasu, Lt Col Santino Bol, referred to the attackers
as “suspected NAS rebels”based upon his knowledge and experience of
activity in the area.

d. One witness — who was amongst those forced to carry looted items — stated
that several of the attackers were known to him personally, and that they
were known to be “loyal to the NAS leader, Thomas Cirillo”.

</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">•. Three other witnesses amongst those abducted said the attackers clearly
identified themselves as NAS.                  </a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">‘

Assessment

12.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">It is often difficult for CTSAMVM to attribute responsibility for alleged NAS
incidents because of the lack of formal liaison with NAS in particular and SSOMA
in general.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">However, in this instance it is the assessment of CTSAMVM that there
is sufficient evidence from eye-witnesses and victims to confirm the identity of the
attackers and determine that they were an NAS armed group.

Conclusions

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">CTSAMVM concludes that by perpetrating a raid against Nyori Refugee Camp on
the night of 22/23 August 2021, NAS forces failed to discharge the obligations
they assumed by signing the ACOH of 17 December 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">In so doing the NAS
have violated the agreement, specifically:</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">Articles 2.0(failure to abide by
International Human Rights Law and/or International Humanitarian Law), 3.0(hostile military actions are prohibited), 4.0(prohibiting Party-Signatories from
occupying or damaging any public or community property), and  (prohibiting
attacks on the civilian population, to include killings, robberies, SGBV, and
inhuman and degrading treatment).

Observations and Recommendations

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">This was a particularly unpleasant attack against civilians in the Nyori Refugee
camp, where both refugees from DRC and South Sudanese IDPs should have
been safe.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">A young girl was subjected to the trauma and humiliation of rape,
because, according to her attacker she “went to a school near an SSPDF camp’.

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">The attackers stole property from those who by definition had very little, and in
doing so blighted the lives of many.

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">CTSAMVM recommends that:</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">

17.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">NAS accepts responsibility for this incident, and takes the appropriate action to
instil discipline amongst those who act in its name.

          
18.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">All Parties concerned work hard to implement the provisions of the Rome
Declaration and its follow-on resolutions.
