 CTSAMM VIOLATION REPORT NUMBER 005
PCTSE VIOLATION IN WESTERN EQUATORIA STATE
Executive Summary


Late at night on 24 December 2015 there was an outbreak of fighting in Lui.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">The
Government Forces garrison was attacked, and four soldiers allegedly killed.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">The
allegation from the Government was that the attack was by the SPLM/A-IO.


</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">Following an investigation which involved interviewing local Government officials and
military officers, as well as members of the civilian population, the JTC assessed that
the attack did take place, and that forces allied to or under command of the SPLM/A-IO
were responsible.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">It is therefore the opinion of the JTC that the SPLM/A-IO were in
violation of the PCTSA.

 VIOLATION IN WESTERN EQUATORIA STATE


1.0  Introduction


</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">1.1  Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">There have been several incidents in Mundri East County over the
past few month, with outbreaks of violence and allegations by both Parties.


1.2  Allegation:</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">The allegation was contained in a letter from the SPLA Director of
Operations to the  D/COGS Operations titled  “Renewed violations of the
cessation of Hostilities Agreement (COH) by the SPLM/A (1O)’ dated 28 January
2016 and given to the CTSAMM JTC in early February, and repeated on a letter
addressed to CTSAMM signed by Nhial Deng dated  March “renewed violations
of the COH and PCTSA by the SPLMIA (IO) (Rebels).</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">It is quoted verbatim as
follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">“</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">On 24'* December 2015</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">:</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">The rebels of Riek Machar attacked SPLA
positions in Lui town from 41.0  PM to 11.0  PM.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">As a result  SPLA soldiers
were killed”.


1.0.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">The aim of this report is to outline for JMEC the results of investigations
into the above allegation with an assessment and recommendations.
</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">1.1  Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">


</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">•</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">AnMVT based in Juba was deployed to Mundri on 22 February 2016.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">They
visited Lui on 22 and 24 February in order to carry out the investigation.


</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">•</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">During the visit they spoke with local officials and interviewed a number of
local civilian witnesses, although they found that the local people were
reluctant to talk to them.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">Government Forces officers stationed in Lui were
uncooperative and gave very little information which the MVT found difficult
to understand as they were  investigating an allegation  made by the
Government.


</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">•</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">Despite the fact that the  incident happened two months  before the
investigation took place, the members of the MVT were able to see at first
hand some signs of fighting in Lui, specifically damage left by RPG's.


</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">•</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">On23 February in Bari and Gariya the MVT was able to get information about
the presence of SPLM/A-IO forces in the general area, and when in Lozoh
and Lanyi earlier on the 24 February about the presence of the SPLM/A-IO
in Mundri East County.



 2.0  VIOLATIONS OF THE PCTSA


2.1  On24 December there was fighting in Lui which started at about 22.0  Hrs and
lasted for about two hours.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">All the evidence suggests that the fighting was a
result of an attack against Lui, and that there was shelling and shooting from two
different directions.


</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">2.0  Four Government Forces soldiers were reportedly killed in the attack.


</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">2.1  None of the witnesses were  willing to identify the  attackers.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">However,
information gained in visits to other parts of the county confirmed the presence
of armed groups who identified themselves as SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">The MVT were not
told about any other armed groups operating in the area other than the SPLM/A-
10.


3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">


</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">3.1  Itis the assessment of the JTC that the attack did take place as described on the
night of 24 December.


</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">3.2  </a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">The attack was directed specifically and deliberately at the Government Forces
in Lui.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">Given the presence of SPLM/A-IO forces in the area and the lack of any
information about other armed groups, it is the assessment of JTC that the
SPLM/A-IO were responsible for the attack.


</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">4.0  Conclusion


4.1  </a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">It is the opinion of CTSAMM that it what happened in Lui on the night of 24"
December 2015 was a violation by the SPLM/A-IO of article 1.0  of the PCTSA,
specifically:</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">


</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">•</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">Article 1.1  of the COHA:</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">“The Parties hereby agree to cease all military
actions aimed at each other...”


5.0  Recommendations and observations:</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">


</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">5.1  CTSAMM recommends that JMEC does all in its power to facilitate the earliest
deployment of AJMCC's by JMCC as soon as possible in order that there can be
dialogue between the Parties in volatile areas such as Mundri East.
