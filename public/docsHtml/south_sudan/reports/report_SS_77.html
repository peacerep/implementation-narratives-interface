EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Mir Mir Cantonment Site (CS) is a designated SPLM/A-IO CS and Mir Mir Payam
was SPLM/A-IO controlled area since the September 2018 when the Peace
Agreement was signed.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">The Koch County Commissioner, Hon Gordon Koang Biel
who belongs to ITGoNU, was reportedly not welcomed in Mir Mir which is one of his
County Payams and as such there was constant disagreement between him and the
SPLM/A-IO Mir Mir CS Commander, Maj Gen Gorge Gatbany.
</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">Around August 2021 there were reports of some internal conflicts within Mir Mir CS
where some soldiers were alleged to have killed a woman and a man who were in
detention at the CS cells.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">The soldiers alleged to have been involved in the killing
were led by Lt. Gatkhor Chuol and Lt. Kulang Mathiang.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">They fled and allegedly
named themselves the “SSPDF aligned Kit Gwang faction of Mir Mir’ and went to
hide around Koch town.
</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">There was fighting mainly between Koch armed youth against SPLM/A-IO forces in
Mir Mir but later spread to Leer County.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">It was further alleged that the Koch County
Commissioner (ITGoNU) allegedly took advantage of the situation and overran the
CS on 11th Feb 22.
SPLM/A-IO defectors who initially fought the Cantonment Site were led  by Lt
Gatkhor Chuol who declared himself commander of SSPDF aligned Kit Gwang
faction of Mir Mir and as such elevated his rank to a Major General after reportedly
defeating the SPLM/A-IO forces in the CS.
</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">The SPLM/A-IO forces were dislodged on 11 February 2022 from the Cantonment
Site positions in Mir Mir by forces/armed youth under Command of Koch County
Commissioner and elements of defected soldiers, the SSPDF aligned Kit Gwang
Faction.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">There is evidence that various violations ranging from rape, physical torture
of civilians and killing by burning of people and properties were committed.
</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that clashes in Koch and Leer Counties did take
place between forces/armed youth under Command of Koch and Mayendit County
Commissioners together with elements of defected soldiers SSPDF aligned Kit
Gwang faction against the SPLM/A-IO forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">These clashes were instigated by the

PRELININARY REPORT INTO ARMED CLASHES, DESTRUCTION OF
PROPERTY AND SGBV CASES IN KOCH AND LEER COUNTIES, UNITY STATE
Introduction

1.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">

</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">a. Mir Mir is a designated SPLM/A-IO Cantonment Site and Mir Mir Payam was
SPLM/A-IO controlled area since the September 2018 when the Peace
Agreement was signed.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">The Koch County Commissioner, Hon Gordon Koang
Biel who belongs to ITGoNU, was reportedly not welcomed in Mir Mir which
is one of his County Payams and as such there was constant disagreement
between the Koch County Commissioner and SPLM/A-IO Mir Mir
Cantonment Site Commander, Maj Gen Gorge Gatbany.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">The Chief and
Payam Administrator for Mir Mir who were appointed by the Koch County
Commissioner were denied access to, stay and/or work in their Mir Mir
offices.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">This was because the SPLM/A-IO side believed that their choices for
the posts of Chief and Payam Administrator in Mir Mir were not considered
and the Commissioner opted to appoint people of his own choice.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">Since then,
there was clear mistrust between the Cantonment Commanders and Koch
County Commissioner.

</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">b. Around August 2021, there were reports of some internal conflicts within
Mir Mir Cantonment Site where some soldiers were alleged to have killed a
woman and a man who were in detention at Mir Mir Cantonment Site cells.
</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">The soldiers alleged to have been involved in the killing led by Lt. Gatkhor
Chuol and Lt. Kulang Mathiang, fled after the incident for fear of being
arrested.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">When they fled, it is reported that they allegedly named themselves
the “SSPDF aligned Kit Gwang faction of Mir Mir’ and went to hide around
Koch town.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">However, on 8th Jan 22, they were said to have come back to
attack the Cantonment Site together with a large group of armed youth from
Koch but they were repulsed by the Cantonment soldiers.

<p><a id="40" name="40">Allegations:</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">

</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">a.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">There were reports of armed clashes in southern parts of Unity State in areas
of Mir Mir in Koch County and parts of Leer County.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">The fighting was mainly
between Koch armed youth against SPLM/A-IO forces in Mir Mir but later
spread to Leer County.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">During these clashes various violations of rape,
arson, looting of properties as well as loss of human lives were reported.
</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">CTSAMVM conducted investigations on the clashes in Mir Mir and the effects
of the conflict on the community like alleged rape cases and the killing by
burning of elderly women in their homes in parts of Leer County.

</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">It was further alleged that the Koch County Commissioner  (ITGoNU)
allegedly took advantage of the situation and fully participated in the conflict
until his forces combined with armed youth and the SSPDF aligned Kit
Gwang faction overran the Cantonment Site on 11th February 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">The aim of this report is to provide the findings of CTSAMVM investigations
into the allegations, attribute responsibility for breaches of the agreements where
applicable and to make recommendations.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">

4.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">

</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">a. CTSAMVM undertook patrols to Mir Mir on 18 January 2022 before it was
overrun and had engagements with the Cantonment Site Commander.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">On 01
March 2022, CTSAMVM engaged with the Koch County Commissioner and
his Deputy who briefed about the attacks on the Mir Mir Cantonment Site.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">

</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">b. CTSAMVM had planned for  days Long Duration Patrol</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">but after two days,
clashes started again and the MVT could not continue with investigations.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">

c. CTSAMVM interviewed a wide range of people including SSPDF Division 
Commander Maj Gen John Maluit Wic Gatyang, Leer County Commissioner
Hon Stephen Taker Riak and his Deputy Hon Paul Kuong, Unity State
Minister for Peace Building Hon.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">James Madut Ruai, Unity State Deputy

and Gender Based violence, held discussions with relevant witnesses,
victims, security organs within the area, Humanitarian workers and
Administrative leaders to gather evidence at different locations within Leer
and Koch Counties from January to April 2022.

</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">d. The standard of proof used by CTSAMVM to determine whether there is
sufficient evidence to verify that a Party is not in compliance with the
provisions of the Agreements is “reasonable grounds to believe that the
incident that is the subject of the investigation occurred.”</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">This is in
accordance with accepted practice for monitoring mechanisms and
humanitarian entities and signifies that sufficient facts and evidence have
been collected to conclude that an event has occurred.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">

</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">Findings

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">The Conflict initially started between the SSPDF aligned Kit Gwang group against
SPLM/A-IO but changed when Koch County Commissioner (ITGONU) took
advantage of the situation and actively got involved until Mir Mir Cantonment Site
was attacked and overrun by the commissioner's forces on 11 February 2022.

6.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">The SSPDF aligned Kit Gwang group was assimilated as part of the forces used
by Koch County Commissioner and later Mayendit Youth under their County
Commissioner joined the conflict.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">Both commissioners are  Key Political
appointees of Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity (RTGoNU)
and are with the ITGoNU.

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">SPLM/A-IO defectors who initially fought the Cantonment Site were led by
Lt Gatkhor Chuol from Mir Mir Cantonment site.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">Lt Gatkhor Chuol declared
himself commander of the SSPDF aligned Kit Gwang faction of Mir Mir and as
such elevated his rank to a Major General after reportedly defeating the SPLM/A-

IO forces in the Cantonment site on 11 Feb 22.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">However, he was reportedly killed
in action in Bieh village when SPLM/A- IO forces under the command of Gen
Ruot Chuol, the SPLM/A-IO Sector commander of Unity State, attacked his
position on 5th April 2022 in a counter attack.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">Several people including the First Vice President Dr. Riek Machar contacted the
SPLM/A-IO Sector Commander and Division Commanders within Leer asking
them not to counter attack Mir Mir.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">But on 5th April 2022, SPLM/A-IO forces went
to Bieh Village and proceeded to attack Mir Mir and took control for some hours
before they were dislodged again in the evening  by the Koch County
Commissioner's forces and SSPDF aligned Kit Gwang defectors.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">General Ruot
Chuol SPLM/A-IO Sector Unity State Commander was blamed for the renewed

faction, all these forces/armed youths were under the control and direction of
Koch and Mayendit County Commissioners.

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">The Deputy Governor of Unity State (SPLM/A-IO) Hon Tor Tungwar stated that,
“there were no major Signatory Parties’ conflicts in Unity state for long time
and what was currently being witnessed in Koch,  Mayendit and Leer
Counties was perpetrated by some few commissioners but they would be

held accountable for their actions soon.”</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">He further stated that:</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">“</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">it is on
record, that there was evidence and facts that points to serious violations
by Koch County Commissioner when he clearly stated he would wipe out
SPLM-IO party and its soldiers from entire Koch County.”</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">He also said that
he “was happy to report no SSPDF involvement in the clashes and
appreciated their professionalism in regards to the way they avoided to be
used by politicians during the clashes.”</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">He assured that SPLM/A-IO would
avoid revenge attacks in Mir Mir but would discuss the issue with Governor
and other IG leaders both at National and state level to find ways to solve it.</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">The Koch County Commissioner was still occupying Mir Mir Cantonment Site as
of 09 April.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">Since 13 February 2022 he had never returned to Koch County HQs.

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">There was large scale forced displacement of civilians by forces under command
of the Koch and Mayendit County Commissioners, as such an influx of IDPs was
witnessed by CTSAMVM in Leer town.</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">Over 13,000 new IDPs had reported to
Leer town as result of the conflict.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">Freedom of Movement and activities by Humanitarian Organisations had been

<p><a id="115" name="115">

17.</a></p>

<p><a id="120" name="120">The three Ports of Wath-Thiey (in Koch), Adok Port (in Leer) and Pak Port (in
Mayendit) which were SPLM/A-IO controlled ports were captured by Koch and
Mayendit armed Youth and are currently under their control.</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">The three ports are
of economic value to the three counties of Koch, Leer and Mayendit.

20.</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">The Deputy Governor Unity State (SPLM/A- IO) and Leer County Commissioner

displacement of the community expected.

</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">Assessment

23.</a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">There could be ulterior motives and reasons other than for this conflict that are
economic.</a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">The capture and occupation of mainly port areas cannot be a mere
coincidence.</a></p>
<p><a id="129" name="129">

24.</a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">The conflict may not end soon unless there is intervention from top political level
leadership.</a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">

25.</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">The conflict requires a joint political approach by all the Parties to the R-ARCSS.
</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">The resolution of the conflict in Tambura may bea good model for resolution.

</a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">Conclusion

26.</a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that clashes in Koch and Leer Counties did
take place between forces/armed youth under Command of Koch and Mayendit
County Commissioners together with elements of defected soldiers, the SSPDF
aligned Kit Gwang faction against the SPLM/A-IO forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="136" name="136">These clashes were
instigated by the government County Commissioners and for this reason the
government must bear responsibility for violations of the R-ARCSS and ACoH.
