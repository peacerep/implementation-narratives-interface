CTSAMVM REPORT 2021/ — VIOLENCE IN THE MOROTO AREA
Executive Summary
On 21 September 2021 Maj General Moses Lokujo Gabriel announced his defection
from SPLM/A-IO to the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">After his change of allegiance his forces based in
Kirwa were responsible for conducting attacks on the Moroto Training Centre in
September and November 2021.
</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">Allegations were made that Maj Gen Moses Lokujo was supported by SSPDF and
had been responsible for breaches of the ceasefire.
</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">CTSAMVM conducted investigations into the activities of Maj Gen Moses Lokujo
forces from September 2020 until February 2021.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">The forces commanded by Maj Gen Moses Lokujo have been accepted by and are
under the control of SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">This amounts to mobilisation and recruitment and as
such is a prohibited act.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">Attacks on Moroto Training Centre were carried out by
affiliated forces which were under the control of the SSPDF.
</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">In addition, SSPDF has occupied Kirwa village in Central Equatoria which is
recorded by CTSAMVM as an area under SPLM/A-IO control following the
declaration of forces in October 2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">The SSPDF has also conducted deployments
of forces without notifying CTSAMVM as required by the R-ARCSS.
</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">CTSAMVM recommends that;</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">SSPDF remove forces from SPLM/A-IO controlled
areas;</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">stops the integration of the forces of Maj Gen Moses Lokujo into the SSPDF
and instead his forces should be fast tracked through a DDR process.

VIOLATIONS IN THE MOROTO AREA

Introduction

1.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">Following the change of allegiance of Maj Gen Moses Lokoju Gabriel (the former
commander of SPLMA-IO Division 2B in Kirwa) to the SSPDF, the situation in the
Moroto, Ajio and Kirwa ' areas has become tense and violent.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">There have been
least two clashes at Moroto Training Centre and allegations by the SPLM/A-lO
that the SSPDF have been involved in supporting the SSPDF affiliated forces of
Maj Gen Lokoju.

2.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">Following an initial attack against Moroto Training Centre on 29 September 2020
steps were taken by the Joint Defence Board (JDB) to stop the situation from
escalating, and various measures were agreed.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">However, none of these
measures were implemented and tensions continued until further fighting broke
out in the area of Moroto Training Centre on 26 November 2020.

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">There have been further clashes notably on  January 2021 near Kajo Keji and
tension between the parties has been heightened since the deployment of
SSPDF forces to Kirwa on  January 2021.

4. Allegations:</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">

a. SPLM/A-IO have made several allegations.
</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">i. That SSPDF have been supporting the forces of Maj Gen Moses Lokujo.
</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">ii.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">That forces loyal to Maj Gen Moses Lokujo are under the command of
SSPDF.
iii.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">That Maj Gen Moses Lokujo has mobilised and recruited soldiers into the
SSPDF.

</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">* The village is shown on CTSAMVM Maps as Kirwa but is also referred to as Kerwa

in the local area.
 </a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">Feb 20        Visit to Kajo Keji, | CTSAMVM team investigation.
</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">| ieee

b. The evidence in this report is extracted from investigation reports prepared by
MVT Yei.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The investigation reports were signed by International Observers and
National Monitors and discussed with Senior National Liaison Officers.

</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">c. The standard of proof used by the CTSAMVM to determine whether there is
sufficient evidence to verify that a Party-Signatory is not in compliance with the
provisions of the Agreements is “reasonable grounds to believe that the
incident that is the subject of the investigation occurred.”</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">This is in accordance
with accepted practice for monitoring mechanisms and humanitarian entities
and signifies that sufficient facts and evidence have been collected to conclude
that an event has occurred

Findings

<p><a id="59" name="59">c. CTSAMVM visited Kirwa on  Feb 2021 and confirmed that it was occupied
by 24 Battalion " Bde Mobile Ground Force and had been occupied since 
Jan 21.

d. Maj Gen Lokujo stated to CTSAMVM during their visit that he had been in
control of the Kirwa area before his change of allegiance in September 2020.
</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">In fact, MVT Yei visited Kirwa on 18 July 2018 and confirmed that SPLM/A-IO
were occupying the area, at that time the forces were commanded by Brig Gen
Moses Lokujo.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">Deployment of Forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">The deployment of forces to Kirwa was not communicated
to CTSAMVM in advance as required by Article 2.1.10.0  of the R-ARCSS and
article 11.0  of ACOH.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">During the visit by the Minister of Defence and CDF to Moroto
on  October 2020 it was stated that a joint SSPDF and SPLM/A-IO force would
be deployed to the Kirwa-Moroto-Ajio area to provide security.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">The deployment of
SSPDF to Kirwa was not a part of a joint force and was not communicated to
SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">The stated purpose of the deployment was to separate Maj Gen
Lokujo’s forces from those of SPLM/A-IO.

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Occupation of Civilian Buildings.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">CTSAMVM visited Kirwa on  Feb 2020 and
confirmed that the SSPDF are occupying the health facility and have dug trenches
in the vicinity of the facility.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">CTSAMVM also confirmed that Maj Gen Moses Lokujo
and forces are occupying a civilian building in the Kajo-Keji area.

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">Change of Allegiance.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">On 21 September 2020 the SPLM/A-IO published a press
statement saying that Maj Gen Moses Lokoju had “defected” to the SSPDF.
</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">Subsequently CTSAMVM received a copy of Maj Gen Moses Lokujo’s resignation
letter on 21 Sep 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">CTSAMVM interviewed Maj Gen Lokujo on  Feb 2021 at
Kajo Keji.

</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">a. Maj Gen Lokujo stated that in July 2020 he was summoned to Juba by
SPLMI/A-IO leadership.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">On 22 July 2020 he was flown to Juba from Panyume.
</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">On that day he travelled on a CTSAMVM aircraft which was scheduled to return
from a Joint Field Visit (JFV) to Panyume cantonment site with CTSAMVM staff
and CTSAMVM Technical Committee (CTC) representatives.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">His request to
travel was agreed because seats were available and where capacity exists
CTSAMVM will assist in movement of party members.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">On the day he left
Panyume Maj Gen Lokujo had no weapons because CTSAMVM does not
permit the carriage of weapons on aircraft.

b. On arrival in Juba Maj Gen Lokujo states that he was placed under house
arrest in the Panorama Hotel near Juba Airport under the supervision of Brig
Gen Bamoth, SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">He was reportedly detained in the hotel for 47 days
before he escaped custody and was driven to Kajo Keji prior to declaring his
change of allegiance on 21 Sep 20 after which he returned to Juba.

</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">c. Maj Gen Lokujo stated to CTSAMVM that his defection  and change of
allegiance was endorsed by the SSPDF Commander in Chief and that he was
ordered to remain within the area that was previously under his control to await
the integration of his forces into the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">He stated that no additional
soldiers or weapons were provided to him by SSPDF but that youths from
Greater Equatoria have been joining his forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">He stated that he has no
working relationship with " Bde Ground Force but that he received orders
from SSPDF HQ in Juba.

NSS Director in Yei, Mr. Alak Deng Alak, that Lokujo’s forces were in the
Ajio/Kirwa area preparing to be integrated into the SSPDF.</a></p>

CTSAMVM was informed by SSPDF 1st Bde Commander Brig Gen John Lual
that Maj Gen Lokujo’s forces were in Kirwa.

</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">•. On 30 Nov 20 CTSAMVM met Col Gush Dieng SSPDF, at the time  Bde
Mobile Ground Force Deputy Commander at  Kajo Keji.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">He informed
CTSAMVM that the Brigade Commander (Brig Gen Lual Deng) had given Maj
Gen Lokujo a standing order to undertake no offensive action and that Maj Gen
Lokujo occasionally reported to the  Brigade.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">CTSAMVM cannot confirm
whether the standing order was in written form or verbal.

f. On  Feb 20 CTSAMVM interviewed Col John Camillo who at the time was
Deputy Commander of HQ ™ Bde Mobile Ground Force SSPDF in Kajo Keji.
</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">He stated that there was no command relationship between his HQ and Maj
Gen Lokujo.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">However, he also stated that he had recently received orders from

which he “executed” on  Feb 21.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">Maj Gen Lokujo reported that he was
ordered to move from Kirwa to Kajo Keji by SSPDF HQ Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">Maj Gen Moses

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">Alleged provision of support to the forces of Maj Gen Lokujo:</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">

a. Maj Gen Lokujo had no weapons when he left Panyume.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">The clashes between
his forces and the SPLM/A-IO were sustained and according to witnesses
involved the use of heavy weapons and equipment and large scale ammunition
expenditure.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">Maj Gen Lokujo stated to CTSAMVM that he “sustains his forces
through his own initiatives’.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">CTSAMVM observed no vehicles in Maj Gen
Lokujo’s positions in Kajo-Keji but SSPDF Mamba type APCs were observed
at Kajo-Keji and Kirwa on  Feb 20.

b. The means by which Maj Gen Lokujo moved his forces from Kirwa to Kajo -
Keji is not known but Col John Camillo, Deputy Commander SSPDF HQ "
Bde Mobile Ground Force, did state that he “executed the relocation” implying
the provision of transport support.

</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">c. The number of soldiers who joined Maj Gen Lokujo when he defected in
September cannot be validated.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">Based upon witness statements CTSAMVM
estimate that Maj Gen Lokujo’s forces involved in the recent clashes amount
to no more than 100, effectively of infantry company strength.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">Maj Gen Lokujo
stated that he has accepted into his force youth from Greater Equatoria.
</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">Witnesses have stated that the youth are armed and have taken part in the
recent clashes.

12.</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">Ceasefire Violations:</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">

a. On 27 September 2020 there were clashes between the forces of Maj Gen
Moses Lokujo and SPLM/A-IO in the Kirwa and Ajio area.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">The clashes were
confirmed by SPLM/A-IO commanders at Moroto and Panyume and by Maj
Gen Moses Lokujo.

b. On 29 September 2020 there were clashes between forces of Maj Gen Moses
Lokujo and SPLM/A-IO at Moroto Training Centre.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">The clashes were confirmed
by SPLM/A-IO and Maj Gen Lokujo.
</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">c. On 26 November 2021 the Moroto Training Centre was attacked by forces led
by Maj Gen Moses Lokujo.</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">Following the attack, the training centre was
vacated and it is no longer operational.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">Witnesses stated that Armoured
Personnel Carriers (APCs) were employed in the attacks.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">When CTSAMVM
visited on  Dec 20 there were no visual signs of heavy vehicles having been
deployed but this does not mean that such equipment was not used.</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">Witnesses
also reported the use of heavy weapons but the type and quantity were not
verified.</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">CTSAMVM confirmed the presence of SSPDF Mamba type military
vehicles with mounted weapons at Kajo Keji and Kirwa on  Feb 2021 but it is
not known if these were the same vehicles reported to have been involved in
the clashes.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">The Mamba type vehicles operated by SSPDF in the area are of
the type shown below, photographed by CTSAMVM on  Feb 21 at Kirwa.

d. On  January 2021 SSPDF alleged that one of their patrols was ambushed by
SPLM/A-IO while travelling towards Kajo Keji at Katingo.</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">The incident was
confirmed by SSPDF and SPLM/A-IO but no casualties were reported.

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">Moroto Training Centre:</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">

a. The Training Centre at Moroto is no longer operational and was evacuated on
26 Nov 20.</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">The trainees and instructors were released to stay at home or ina
safe area until the situation improves.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">On 29 Nov 21 the Training Centre
Commander, SPLM/A-IO Brig Gen Wal Choul, stated that the site would not be
opened until joint SSPDF/SPLM/A-IO forces had taken  responsibility for
security in the area and the SSPDF-affiliated forces of Maj Gen Moses Lokujo
had been moved from his present location which at the time was Kirwa.

b. Prior to the attack on Moroto on 26 Nov 2020 by the forces of Maj Gen Lokujo
the Moroto Training Centre was unable to deliver unified training because it
was occupied only by SPLM/A-IO and SSOA trainees.</a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">The instructors were
drawn from all parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">The lack of balance in the centre was identified at the
17" CTSAMVM Board along with a recommendation for the JDB to address

the need to ensure all trainees were balanced between SSPDF, SPLM/A-IO,
and SSOA as required in the R-ARCSS.

Assessment

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">SSPDF have occupied locations which are registered by CTSAMVM as being
under the control of SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">Assertions that the locations were under the
control of Maj Gen Lokujo prior to his defection are not sustainable because the
controlling party of the area was acknowledged as being SPLM/A-IO in 2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">Maj</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">
Lokujo has declared he is no longer part of the SPLM/A-IO;</a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">therefore, the control
over the area remains with SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">The reasons given for occupying Kirwa
Gen were to provide a buffer between the forces of Maj Gen Lokujo and SPLM/A-
;</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">this is not a justification for occupying Kirwa.
15.</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">The forces of Maj Gen Moses Lokujo are occupying civilian infrastructure in Kajo
Keji.</a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">The forces of SSPDF are occupying a health care facility in Kirwa.</a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">Both
occupations are now recorded on the CTSAMVM register of occupied buildings.

<p><a id="129" name="129">Also, the movement of Maj Gen Moses Lokujo forces from Kirwa to Kajo Keji was
conducted on the order of SSPDF without  communicating the intention to
CTSAMVM.

17.Maj Gen Moses Lokujo and his forces have been conducting offensive operations
in the Moroto area since his defection announced on 21 Sep 20.</a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">It is clear from
the evidence collected that he responds to orders from SSPDF HQ in Juba and
SSPDF HQ " Bde Mobile Ground Force at Kajo Keji.</a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">On 30 Oct 20 CTSAMVM
were informed that the forces of Maj Gen Moses Lokujo were in the process of
being integrated into SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">On  Nov 20 his forces were confirmed as being in
Kirwa.</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">On  Jan 2021 SSPDF forces occupied Kirwa alongside the forces of Maj
Gen Moses Lokujo.</a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">On  Feb 20 Maj Gen Lokujo and his forces were relocated to
Kajo Keji;</a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">in occupying a position only 500 metres from the SSPDF HQ " Bde
Mobile Ground Force they are effectively co-located with the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="136" name="136">It is clear
from all the evidence collected that SSPDF have accepted the change of allegiance
of Maj Gen Moses Lokujo and that forces which he commands are affiliated to
SSPDF whilst undergoing integration.</a></p>
<p><a id="137" name="137">The acceptance of soldiers changing sides
means that the SSPDF has increased its strength at the expense of SPLM/A-IO in
complete disregard of the ongoing unification of forces.

18.</a></p>
<p><a id="138" name="138">There have been verified incidents of fighting between the forces of Maj Gen
Moses Lokujo which are affiliated to SSPDF and the SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="139" name="139">However, it is not
possible to verify the degree to which Maj Gen Moses Lokujo had been integrated
at the time of the attacks on SPLM/A-IO on 27 and 29 Sep 20.</a></p>
<p><a id="140" name="140">All the evidence in
the attack on 26 Nov 20 at Moroto indicates that the forces of Maj Gen Lokujo were
receiving orders from SSPDF and had begun the process of integration.</a></p>
<p><a id="141" name="141">The only
verified incident involving a direct clash between SSSPDF and SPLM/A-IO was on
 Jan 20 which resulted in no casualties and was resolved quickly by commanders
on the ground.</a></p>
<p><a id="142" name="142">The clashes between the SSPDF affiliated forces of Maj Gen Lokujo
and SPLM/A-IO at Moroto, Kirwa and Andijo were a result of provocative action
instigated by Maj Gen Lokujo.

19.CTSAMVM cannot verify the extent to which SSPDF have been supporting the
forces of Maj Gen Lokujo during the recent clashes;</a></p>
<p><a id="143" name="143">however, witness statements
reveal that protected vehicles and heavy weapons were used in the attack on
Moroto Training Centre.</a></p>
<p><a id="144" name="144">It is confirmed that in the Kajo Keji area SSPDF have
equipment which matches the descriptions provided by witnesses.</a></p>
<p><a id="145" name="145">It is not possible
to confirm whether Maj Gen Lokujo received weapons or ammunition from SSPDF
although it is a fact that he was not in possession of any weapons when he left
Panyume on 22 July 20.</a></p>
<p><a id="146" name="146">It is not possible to confirm whether SSPDF forces were
used to support the forces of Maj Gen Lokujo.</a></p>
<p><a id="147" name="147">It is confirmed by Maj Gen Lokujo
that he has accepted into his force youths from Greater Equatoria.

20.</a></p>
<p><a id="148" name="148">The failure to ensure a balance of forces from all parties in Moroto Training Centre
resulted in the trainees from SPLM/A-IO being vulnerable to the armed action
carried out by the forces of Maj Gen Lokujo after his defection.</a></p>
<p><a id="149" name="149">Had there been a
large-scale presence of SSPDF trainees in the training centre the fighting could
have been avoided because it would have been in the best interests of all parties
to ensure the security of Moroto.

Conclusions

21.It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that by occupying Kirwa from  Jan 2021 SSPDF
failed to comply with the R-ARCSS, specifically Article 2.0.10.0, and ACOH,
Articles 3.0  and 11.0, which prohibit hostile and provocative actions such as the
redeployment and movement of forces.

22.</a></p>
<p><a id="150" name="150">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM by moving troops from Kajo Keji to Kirwa on 
Jan 2021 and moving troops from Kirwa to Kajo Keji on  Feb, the SSPDF failed

to comply with the R-ARCSS, specifically Article 2.0.10.0, which provides that
Parties are to refrain from prohibited actions such as “redeployment and movement
of forces, except for administrative and logistical movements allowed under COHA
of 21st December 2017, which will be reported to CTSAMVM prior to movements”.

23.</a></p>
<p><a id="151" name="151">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that the occupation of civilian buildings by SSPDF
at Kirwa and by the affiliated forces of Maj Gen Lokujo at Kajo Keji represents a
failure by SSPDF to implement Article 2.0.3.0“that  civilian areas will be
immediately demilitarised”.

24.</a></p>
<p><a id="152" name="152">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that the acceptance of those forces of Maj Gen
Lokujo as well as the armed youth that he has mobilised indicates the SSPDF has
failed to implement Article 2.0.10.0:</a></p>
<p><a id="153" name="153"> (prohibited actions) recruitment and
mobilisation.

25.</a></p>
<p><a id="154" name="154">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that it is not possible to confirm the extent to
which SSPDF have provided support to the forces of Maj Gen Lokujo;</a></p>
<p><a id="155" name="155">however,
the reports of the involvement of Mamba-type APCs during the attack on Moroto
are credible and the only source of such equipment in the area is SSPDF.
</a></p>
<p><a id="156" name="156">Furthermore, it is difficult to envisage how SSPDF could have “executed the
relocation” of Maj Gen Lokujo forces from Kirwa to Kajo Keji without providing
transport support.

26.</a></p>
<p><a id="157" name="157">It is the conclusion that the JDB/JTSC inability to achieve a balance of forces in
Moroto Training Centre contributed to the poor security in the area following the
defection of Maj Gen Lokujo.

Observations and Recommendations

27.CTSAMVM recommends:</a></p>
<p><a id="158" name="158">

a. That SSPDF withdraw forces from Kirwa.
</a></p>
<p><a id="159" name="159">b. That the integration of the forces of Maj Gen Lokujo into SSPDF is stopped
and instead his forces are quickly put through a DDR process.
</a></p>
<p><a id="160" name="160">c. That JDB decide the long-term future of Moroto Training Centre and either
ensure there is an equitable balance between trainees from all parties or close
the centre permanently.

d. That the issue of Changes of Allegiance is addressed at the political level by
IGAD and R-JMEC.

</a></p>
<p><a id="161" name="161">•. That all parties fully commit to the processes which will lead to the unification
of forces as stipulated in the R-ARCSS.
