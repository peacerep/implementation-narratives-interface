          FINAL REPORT ON THE ARMED CLASHES AND VIOLATIONS AGAINST
CIVILIANS IN KOCH AND LEER COUNTIES OF UNITY STATE
|
|          Introduction
1. Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">
a. Mir Mir Cantonment Site (CS) was a designated SPLM/A-IO Cantonment Site
and Mir Mir Payam was SPLM/A-IO controlled area since the September
2018 when the Peace Agreement was signed.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">The Koch County
Commissioner, Hon Gordon Koang Biel (ITGoNU), was reportedly not
welcomed in Mir Mir which is one of the County Payams and as such he was
in constant disagreements with the SPLM/A-IO Mir Mir Cantonment Site
Commander Maj Gen Gorge Gatbany.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">The Chief and Payam Administrator
for Mir Mir who were appointed by the Koch County Commissioner were
reportedly denied access to stay and/or work in their Mir Mir offices.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">This was
because the SPLM/A-IO believed that their choices for the posts of Chief and
Payam Administrator in Mir Mir were not considered and the Commissioner
opted to appoint people of his own choice.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">Since then, there was clear
mistrust between the Cantonment Commanders and Koch County
Commissioner.
</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">b. Around August 2021, there were reports of some internal conflicts within
Mir Mir Cantonment Site where some soldiers were alleged to have killed a
woman and a man who were in detention at Mir Mir Cantonment Site cells.
</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">The soldiers alleged to have been involved in the killing led by Lt. Gatkhor
Chuol and Lt. Kulang Mathiang, fled after the incident and went to hide
around Koch town.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">However, on 08 Jan 22, they allegedly came back to
attack the Cantonment Site together with a large group of armed youth from
Koch but were repulsed by the Cantonment soldiers.
</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">c. On 23 Jan 2022, the SPLM/A-IO defectors of Mir Mir supported by armed
youth from Koch again attacked Mir Mir CS where one person was allegedly
                     killed and three others wounded in the Cantonment.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">On 27 Jan 22, the Koch
                    armed youth and the SPLM/A-IO defectors attacked SPLM/A-IO forces
                        position in Wath-Thiey Port near Mir Mir which was under SPLM/A-IO control.
                </a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">Wath-Thiey is the only port in Koch County.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">Since then, the Koch County
|                     Commissioner allegedly took advantage of the situation and fully participated
in the conflict until when the combined forces of the Koch County
Commissioner armed youth and the SPLM/A-IO defectors overran the CS on
11th February 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">After suffering defeat, the SPLM/A-IO forces moved
southwards to parts of Leer County.
</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">2. Allegations:</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">

a. There were reports of armed clashes in southern parts of Unity State in areas
of Mir Mir in Koch County and parts of Leer County.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">The fighting was mainly
between Koch armed youth against SPLM/A-IO forces in Mir Mir but later
spread to Leer County.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">During these clashes various violations of rape,
arson, as well as loss of property and human lives reportedly took place.

b. It was further alleged that the Koch County Commissioner (ITGoNU)
allegedly took advantage of the situation and fully participated in the conflict
until his forces combined with armed youth and the SPLM/A-IO defectors of

|                         Mir Mir overran the Cantonment Site on 11th February 2022.

</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">c. It was also alleged that after the successful captured of Mir Mir, the Mayendit
youth under their County Commissioner formed an alliance with Koch armed
youth as one group and managed to push SPLM/A-lO forces further

                       southwards towards Leer County and the conflict spread drastically to almost
all SPLM/A-IO controlled villages in Leer County till the capture of Adok port
(in Leer) by the combined armed Youth of Mayendit and Koch County
Commissioners on 8th April 2022.

Counties and the effects of the conflict on the community especially on the
alleged cases of killing people, burning of the elderly in their homes and
SGBV in parts of Leer County.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">CTSAMVM MVT Bentiu conducted interviews

|                 and discussions with the relevant witnesses, victims, security organs,

|

|                       humanitarian entities and signifies that sufficient facts and evidence have

           </a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">Findings

|

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">The conflict in Mir Mir initially started between the SPLM/A-IO defectors of Mir Mir

who turned against SPLM/A-IO, but changed when Koch County Commissioner

                 (ITGONU) took advantage of the situation and actively got involved until when Mir

                 Mir Cantonment Site was attacked and overrun by the Commissioner's forces on

                11 February 2022.

           6.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">The SPLM/A-IO defectors were assimilated as part of the forces used by Koch

|              County Commissioner and later Mayendit Youth under their County
Commissioner joined the conflict.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">Both Commissioners are key political
appointees of Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity (RTGoNU)
and they belong to the ITGoNU.

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">The Koch County Commissioner confirmed that there existed an administrative

|           dispute between his administration and the Mir Mir Cantonment Commander
where he said despite him being a County Commissioner and Mir Mir being one
of his Payams, he was not allowed to visit Mir Mir payam and engage with the
community ever since the time he was appointed.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">He stated that Mir Mir Payam
was reporting and accountable to Mir Mir Cantonment Site Commander.

        8. SPLM/A-IO defectors who initially fought the Cantonment Site were led by

                Lt Gatkhor Chuol from Mir Mir Cantonment Site.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">Lt Gatkhor Chuol defected with
other three soldiers and elevated himself to the rank of Major General after

                 reportedly defeating the SPLM/A-IO forces in the Cantonment site on 11 Feb 22.
</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">However, he was reportedly killed in action in Bieh village when SPLM/A- IO
forces under the command of Gen Ruot Chuol, the SPLM/A-IO Sector
commander of Unity State, attacked them on 5th April 2022 in a counter attack.

|        9.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">Several people including the First Vice President Dr. Riek Machar reportedly

|           contacted the SPLM/A-IO Sector Commander and other SPLM/A-IO Division

|                                                  
Commanders within Unity State asking them not to counter attack Mir Mir.
</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">However, on Sth April 2022, SPLM/A-IO forces went to Bieh Village and
|              proceeded to attack Mir Mir and took control for some hours before they were
|          dislodged again in the evening by the armed youth under the Koch County
|             Commissioner and the SPLM/A-IO defectors.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">General Ruot Chuol SPLM/A-lO
Sector Unity State Commander was blamed for the renewed clashes of April
2022 whereby, during the fighting destruction of humanitarian facilities were
witnessed especially destruction of health centres, vandalism and looting of
civilian foods and WFP stores.
</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">10.The SPLM/A-IO forces were dislodged from Mir Mir Cantonment Site by the
armed youth under the command of Koch County Commissioner and elements of
SPLM/A-IO defectors on 11 February 2022.
</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">11.There is evidence that multiple forms of SGBV including massive gang rapes and
physical torture of civilians took place.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">During the conflict the total number of girls
and women who were subjected to SGBV in Koch and Leer Counties range
between 79-320 cases.
</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">12.During the clashes from February to April 2022, a total number of 134 people
were reportedly killed.
</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">13.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">There was reported burning of the elderly people in their tukuls and properties by
the armed youth of Koch and Mayendit together with the SPLM/A-IO defectors.
</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">14.The Deputy Governor of Unity State (SPLM/A-IO) Hon Tor Tungwar stated that,
“it is on record, that there was evidence and facts that points to serious
violations by Koch County Commissioner when he clearly stated he would
wipe out SPLM/A-IO Party and its soldiers from entire Koch County.”</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">He
also said that he “was happy to report that there was no SSPDF involvement
in the clashes and appreciated their professionalism in regards to the way
they avoided to be used by politicians during the clashes.”</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">He further stated
that “SPLM/A-IO would avoid revenge attacks in Mir Mir but would discuss
|
|            the issue with Governor and other IG leaders both at National and State
|                   levels to find ways to solve it”.
</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">|            15.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">The Koch County Commissioner was still occupying Mir Mir Cantonment Site as
|             of 20 May 22.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">Since 13 February 2022 he had never returned to Koch County
HQs.
           16.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">There was large scale of forced displacement of civilians by the armed clashes
and armed violence, as such an influx of IDPs was witnessed by CTSAMVM in
Leer town.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">Over ,497 new IDPs had reported to Leer town as result of the
conflict.
17.Freedom of Movement and activities by Humanitarian Organisations had been
greatly affected as of 09 April 2022 as all the teams had closed their activities
and evacuated to safety at UNMISS GHANBATT due to the volatile situation.
</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">18.There is evidence that women were used as forced labourers to carry looted
properties for long distances by armed youth under Koch and Mayendit County
Commissioners.
</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">19.The three Ports of Wath-Thiey (in Koch), Adok Port (in Leer) and Pak Port (in
Mayendit) which were SPLM/A-IO controlled ports were captured by Koch and
Mayendit armed youth and were under their control for some days.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">Adok and Pak
ports have since reverted under the control of the SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">The three ports
                    are of economic value to the three counties of Koch, Leer and Mayendit.
</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">20.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">The Deputy Governor Unity State (SPLM/A- 1O) and Leer County Commissioner
           (ITGoONU) are the only political leaders who have condemned the conflict in
Southern part of Unity State.
</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">21.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">Little and/or nothing tangible has so far been done by the Unity State Security
Committee Chaired by the Governor to address the problem.
                                                  
</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">|
|                22.At</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">the time of writing this report, there is still unchecked tension with more
displacement of the community expected in Koch and Leer Counties and some
                      parts of Mayendit.
</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">|
Assessment
          23.In addition to fighting for space to control Koch and particularly Mir Mir, there
|                could be other ulterior motives and reasons that are economic.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">The capture and
|                    occupation of mainly port areas cannot be a mere coincidence.
</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">24.The Koch County Commissioner mobilised the youth and eventually fought the
|                  SPLM/A-IO in reaction to the former being denied access to exercise his authority
                   in Mir Mir Payam by the latter.
</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">|              25.General Ruot Chuol the SPLM/A-IO Sector Unity State Commander is
                   responsible for the April clashes in Koch due to his actions of mobilising forces at
Bouth village and proceeded to make a revenge attack at Mir Mir.
</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">|
         26.The conflict may not end soon unless there is intervention from National and
State political level leadership to allow SPLM/A-IO occupy their Cantonment Site
                     of Mir Mir.
</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">|              27.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">The conflict requires a joint political approach by all the Parties to the R-ARCSS.
</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">|
                   The resolution of the conflict in Tambura may be a good model for resolution.
              </a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">Conclusion
|
           28.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that clashes in Koch and Leer Counties did
|                take place between the armed youth under the command of Koch and Mayendit
|                  County Commissioners together with the SPLM/A-lO defectors against the
                    SPLM/A-IO forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">These clashes were instigated by the two government County
|                    Commissioners of Koch and Mayendit in violation of the R-ARCSS and ACoH.
|
