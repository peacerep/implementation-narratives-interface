surrounding the hostilities in Renk, Upper Nile State on 06 and 09 June 2014.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">And, where
relevant, apportion responsibilities for violations of the COHA to either of the parties.

and makes an assessment of possible violations of the COHA, based on evidence gathered.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">It
concludes with the JTC’s opinion on the attribution of responsibilities for the violations.
2.0  Investigation / Verification Methodology
2.1      Employing Monitoring and Verification Mechanism (MVM) Standard Operating
Procedures, the MVT based in the UNMISS camp in Malakal initiated the investigation /
verification sequence with Flash Reports and Daily Situation Reports on 06 and 09 June.
</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">Subsequently, the JTC formally issued Investigation and Verification Orders to MVT Malakal
on 09 June, following direction from the JTC Chairman.
</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">2.2      The MVTs conducted investigations in accordance with the orders, in order to augment
the information already provided and corroborate reports received from other sources.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The
result of initial investigations was an MVT Investigation and Verification Report on 13 June.
</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">This report is based on the combined analysis of all reports and evidence received by the JTC
up until 1200hrs on 15 June 2014.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">All relevant MVT reports are referenced in this document
and available for additional scrutiny, if required.
3.0  Main Events — Renk (6 and  June 2014)'
3.1      MVT reporting suggests that hostilities took place in the area of Renk on 06 June from
0630hrs -1200hrs, and 09 June from 0645hrs-1400hrs.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">On both occasions, Government and
SPLM/A-IO Forces exchanged direct and indirect fire.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">Reports indicate that SPLM/A-IlO
Forces in a location known locally as the Jazeera (approximately 5km northwest from the
center of Renk) exchanged fire with Government Forces from Abu-Khadara (approximately
8km north from the center of Renk).</a></p>

Nile around Renk, and SPLM/A-IO Forces are dominant on the west bank.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">Both parties are
known to patrol their areas and contest for the control of the area known as Jazeera.
</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">Unconfirmed reports indicate that fighting resulted in a number of military and civilian
casualties, as well as causing the temporary displacement of civilians.
</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">3.2     The acting commander of the Government Forces in the Renk area during the time of
the incidents was Brigadier Logocho Kolen Reuben.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">Unconfirmed reports indicate that the
commander of the SPLM/A-IO Forces in the area to the west of Renk and south to Wadekona
is Major General James Gai Yoach, along with militia leader Mohammed Shol.
4.0  Assessment — Renk (06 and 09 June 2014)
41   JTC assessments indicate that the investigations into events in the area of Renk
(Upper Nile State) on 06 and 09 June are inconclusive.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">SPLM/A-IO Forces exchanged indirect
and direct fire with Government Forces on both dates in the area between Jazeera and Abu-
Khadara and, as such, both parties failed to cease all military actions in accordance with the
COHA.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">However, responsibility for the initiation of the attacks has not been confirmed and is
likely to be the result of a meeting engagement by patrols of both parties.
</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">5.0  Conclusion
5.1      As a result of investigations, and the weight of evidence collated, it is the opinion of the
JTC that neither the SPLM/A-IO Forces nor Government Forces can be found responsible for
initiating the exchange of fire in the area of Renk on 06 and 09 June.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">However, forces loyal to
both parties violated the following articles of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, 23
January 2014:</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">
</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">- 1.0-1.1(inclusive) Declaration of Cessation of Hostilities
5.0      </a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">It is therefore recommended that the IGAD Special Envoys take the appropriate action
against the Government and SPLM/A-IO in response to the violations of the Cessation of
Hostilities Agreement.
