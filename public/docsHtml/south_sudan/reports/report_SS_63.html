EXECUTIVE</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">SUMMARY

</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">On 24 October 2021 armed soldiers from the SSPDF Mobile Force Unit at Lasu
entered the UNHCR refugee camp at Nyori.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">One of the soldiers asked for and then
aggressively demanded money from a civilian camp resident.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">Upon being denied this
request by the resident, the soldier accused him of being a “rebel sympathiser,”
threatened to arrest him, and told him he deserved to be killed.
</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The soldier then grabbed the camp resident's mobile phone from a table and placed
it into his own pocket, after which he (the soldier) aimed his AK-47 rifle at the
resident's leg and fired a round, resulting in a grazing wound.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">When the soldier
aimed his rifle at the resident's chest, the resident grabbed the barrel of the weapon
to divert its aim away from himself.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">The two struggled over the possession of the rifle
and, during this struggle, the soldier fired the weapon at least two or three times.
</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">At the time of the weapon’s discharge, it was pointed indiscriminately at the house of
Nyori Refugee Camp Chief Joseph Malis.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">One of the bullets entered Chief Joseph’s
abdomen, causing a serious wound from which he later succumbed at Yei Hospital
in Yei town.
</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">The SSPDF is responsible for serious breaches of several provisions of the ACOH of
21 Dec 2017 and the R-ARCSS of 12 Sep 2018, specifically:</a></p>

ASSAULT AND KILLING IN NYORI REFUGEE CAMP

INTRODUCTION

1.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">UNHCR operates the Nyori Refugee Camp, which was established
in 2009 to support refugees from the DRC.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">The camp is occupied by refugees from
DRC and South Sudanese IDPs seeking refuge from the violence and deprivation
caused by the internal armed conflict in South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">Security in the area has been
a concern since September 2021 when the camp was attacked by NAS soldiers
who looted homes, destroyed medical facilities and abducted civilians, (CTSAMVM
Report 2022/01).</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">

2.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Allegation:</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">It was alleged that on 24 October 2021 that there was a shooting
incident at Nyori Refugee Camp in which the Nyori Chief was killed and a youth
leader wounded by a soldier from the SSPDF Mobile Force based at Lasu Payam,
Yei County, Central Equatoria State.

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">The aim of this report is to present the findings of CTSAMVM investigations
into alleged or suspected violations of provisions of applicable agreements, to
attribute responsibility for breaches of the agreements, and to make
recommendations with regard to compliance actions that will help foster peace and
reconciliation.</a></p>

<p><a id="58" name="58">a. CTSAMVM carried out targeted monitoring at Nyori, Lasu and Yei from 25 - 28
October 2021 and follow up enquiries at Nyori on  February 2022.

<p><a id="92" name="92">

FINDINGS

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">Since the NAS attack on 22 September 2021 the SSPDF based in Lasu have
provided security patrols around the Nyori Refugee Camp area.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">There is no
marked perimeter of the camp but the camp is long established and the inhabitants
are very familiar with the limits of the camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">SSPDF patrols are routinely conducted
outside the refugee camp area.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">If for any reason soldiers need to enter the camp,
then there are local arrangements for weapons to be left in the custody of the

Community Policing offices located within the administration section of the camp.

</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">The measures to control weapons at Nyori were set up between UNHCR and an
NGO, the Mission to Alleviate Suffering in South Sudan (MASS).</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">UNHCR prohibits
the carriage of weapons in the Nyori Refugee Camp, but signage is poor.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">Some
SSPDF soldiers adhere to the weapon-control policy and leave weapons in the
custody of the Community Policing offices.</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">Unfortunately, some blatantly ignore
the policy, and camp administrators raised this as a concern with CTSAMVM.

6.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">On Sunday, 24 October 2021, between two to four armed SSPDF soldiers entered
the refugee camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">They were part of a routine patrol, but other patrol members
remained outside.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">The soldiers retained their weapons.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">Two of the soldiers were
identified as Lance Corporal (LCpl) Chep and Private (Pvt) Ativan.</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">Witnesses
stated that the soldiers were drunk.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">The soldiers approached Mr. Sam Allora in the
vicinity of the camp market, which is open for business on Sundays.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">Mr. Allora
was known to LCpl Chep, who proceeded to ask for money from Mr. Allora.</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">When
camp-resident Allora responded that he had no money at the moment, LCp!| Chep
became aggressive and violent in comportment, threatening to arrest Sam Allora
and accusing him of providing support to “rebels” and of being a “NAS rebel
sympathiser.”</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">Further, LCpl Chep continued to threaten Allora by asserting that
many soldiers had been killed by local residents and that, therefore, Allora
deserved to be killed as well.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">LCp!</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">Chep then grabbed Allora’s mobile phone from
a nearby table, placed it into his own pocket and refused to return it to Allora.</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">LCpl
Chep then threatened to shoot Allora and aimed his rifle at Allora’s leg.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">When Allora
pulled his leg away, LCpl Chep fired a round from the rifle that grazed Allora’s leg,
causing him injury.</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">LCpl Chep next aimed his weapon at Allora’s chest.</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">Allora
immediately grabbed the barrel of the rifle to attempt to divert its aim from himself,
whilst LCp!</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">Chen retained control of the rifle’s trigger.</a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">As the two struggled, LCpl
Chep fired one to three rounds — at this time, the barrel of the rifle was
indiscriminately aimed at the house of Nyori Refugee Cano Chief Joseph Malis,
who was in his home at that moment.</a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">One of the bullets fired from LCp!</a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">Chep’s
AK-47 hit Chief Joseph in the abdomen, causing serious injury which ultimately —
at Yei Hospital later that evening — caused his demise.

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">The shooting was reported to the SSPDF Mobile Force Unit in Lasu, which
dispatched a vehicle to evacuate the wounded civilians to Yei Hospital.</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">They also
rendered first aid until the casualty evacuation was completed.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">The injuries sustained by Mr. Malis were severe and while undergoing treatment
at Yei hospital he died.</a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">Mr. Allora was treated for minor injuries on his right leg and
was subsequently released.</a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">LCp!</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">Chep later returned to the SSPDF camp at Lasu
where he was promptly arrested.</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">SSPDF officers indicate he will be charged at a
General Court-Martial at Yei.

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">CTSAMVM interviewed Brig Gen. John Lual, Commander, SSPDF Bde , who
confirmed that a soldier from the Lasu SSPDF Mobile unit had gone to the Nyori
Refugee Camp, where he had argument with some civilians in the camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">He stated
that the soldier had earlier been accused of forcibly taking items/property from the
camp inhabitants.</a></p>
<p><a id="129" name="129">This indicates that such activity was not an isolated incident.

</a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">ASSESSMENT

10.The death of Nyori Refugee Camp Chief Mr. Joseph Malis resulted from the
criminal actions of an SSPDF soldier present within the Nyori Refugee Camp in an
unauthorized status.</a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">

11.Mr.</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">Malis was killed because SSPDF soldiers entered the refugee camp with
weapons which should have been in safe custody and, exploiting the opportunity
of being within the refugee camp armed, one of those soldiers assaulted, stole a
mobile phone, and attempted to steal cash from one of the refugee-camp residents.
</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">In the process of this assault and robbery and attempted robbery, he discharged
his AK-47 rifle at least twice.</a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">

12.The SSPDF soldier who perpetrated the series of assaults, the robbery and
attempted robbery, and the shooting that resulted in the injury to one refugee-camp
resident and the death of another was clearly engaged in activity on refugee-camp
premises that was wholly distinct from and unrelated to any legitimate patrolling or
security-related activity.

</a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">13.The perpetrator engaged in criminal behaviour by assaulting a refugee-camp
resident both by pointing his AK-47 rifle at him and by purposely shooting him in
the leg and then pointing the weapon at his chest, as well as by stealing that
refugee-camp resident's mobile phone and attempting to deprive that refugee-
camp resident of any cash he might have on his person.</a></p>
<p><a id="136" name="136">The evidence obtained by
CTSAMVM indicates that the soldier aimed and purposely fired his AK-47 rifle at
camp-resident Sam Allora’s leg, the bullet grazing Allora’s leg.</a></p>
<p><a id="137" name="137">Upon realizing that
he had only grazed Allora’s leg, the SSPDF soldier aimed his AK-47 rifle at Allora’s
chest.</a></p>
<p><a id="138" name="138">This constitutes a separate, completed assault (i.•. the aiming of the weapon
at the victim’s chest).</a></p>
<p><a id="139" name="139">

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="140" name="140">The perpetrator, SSPDF LCpl Chep, was responsible for the death of Mr Joseph
Malis.

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="141" name="141">The perpetrator attempted robbery because his intent at the time he raised his rifle
was to take money from the refugee-camp resident that did not belong to him, the
perpetrator/SSPDF-soldier.</a></p>
<p><a id="142" name="142">The perpetrator also took the phone belonging to Mr
Sam Allora and placed it in his pocket.</a></p>
<p><a id="143" name="143">This latter act constitutes a completed
robbery, and not merely an “Attempt,” as there was a successful “taking” by
assailant SSPDF soldier LCp!</a></p>
<p><a id="144" name="144">Chep of victim Sam Allora’s mobile phone.)</a></p>
<p><a id="145" name="145">

16.SSPDF have clearly accepted responsibility for LCp!</a></p>
<p><a id="146" name="146">Chep and his actions at the
Refugee Camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="147" name="147">Commander Bde  informed CTSAMVM that the soldier was being
detained in custody at SSPDF  Bde HQ in Yei and would appear before a court-
martial “for the crimes he had committed against civilians” in the Nyori Refugee
Camp.

17.SSPDF routinely enter the refugee camp at Nyori.</a></p>
<p><a id="148" name="148">Article 2.0.3.0  of the R-ARCSS
requires the demilitarization of “civilian areas.”</a></p>
<p><a id="149" name="149">The Article expressly includes
facilities such as the Nyori Refugee Camp.

18.The SSPDF soldier who fired the rounds that resulted in injury to one civilian
refugee-camp resident and death of another committed several criminal offenses

under South Sudanese law, specifically the South Sudan Penal Code, during the
course of the incident.

</a></p>
<p><a id="150" name="150">CONCLUSIONS

19.SSPDF soldiers who were reported to be drunk entered Nyori Refugee Camp, a
civilian area that the R-ARCSS expressly requires to be demilitarised.

20.</a></p>
<p><a id="151" name="151">The SSPDF is responsible for serious breaches of several provisions of the ACOH
of 21 Dec 2017 and the R-ARCSS of 12 Sep 2018, including the following;</a></p>
<p><a id="152" name="152">

21.</a></p>
<p><a id="168" name="168">The behaviour of the SSPDF soldiers in the Nyori Refugee Camp indicates that
they were poorly trained, ill disciplined, badly led, and unaware of their
responsibilities to protect civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="169" name="169">The soldiers paid no attention to local
prohibitions on the carriage of weapons in the refugee camp.

22.While the local commander took commendable action in response to the incidents
in Nyori, it is clear that the appropriate training, command and control procedures
and community liaison to support security patrols had not been enacted.

23.Activities and behaviour of SSPDF soldiers continues to evidence the fact that the
SSPDF/Government has ignored and continues to ignore the requirement within
both the ACOH and the R-ARCSS to “ensure that its affiliates and all forces or
armed groups under its command and control at all times observe the Agreement,
particularly the provisions on prohibited acts.</a></p>
<p><a id="170" name="170">This requires all parties o educate
and train their forces on the obligations and prohibitions set forth in the provisions
of the Agreement and to hold them accountable for breaches of those
requirements.
</a></p>
<p><a id="171" name="171">Observations and Recommendations
24.The commander of the SSPDF unit to which the soldier responsible for the above
crimes in the Nyori Refugee Camp belongs should be commended for rendering
immediate first aid and evacuation to the casualties, taking responsibility for the
action of LCp!| Chep and ensuring the prompt arrest and detention of the
perpetrator.
