<p><a id="16" name="16">Introduction

1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">

</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">•</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">There has for some time been ongoing tension in northern Upper Nile state
between the forces of Major General Johnson  Olony and those of the
Government.

</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">•</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">The area to the west of the Nile is held in places by the forces of Major
General Olony.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">These forces are allied to the SPLM/A-IO.

1.2  </a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">Allegation:</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">The allegation was contained in a letter from the SPLA Director of
Operations to the D/COGS  Operations titled “Renewed  violations of the
cessation of Hostilities Agreement (COH) by the SPLM/A (IO)” dated 28 January
2016 and given to the CTSAMM JTC in early February, and repeated on a letter
addressed to CTSAMM signed by Nhial Deng dated  March “renewed violations
of the COH and PCTSA by the SPLM/A (IO) (Rebels).</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">It is quotes verbatim as
follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">“</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">On the 28°" January 2016</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">:</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">The forces of Riek Machar under the
command of Johnson Olony shelled SPLA position in Jalhak from 9.0  AM till
41.0  AM from the western side of the Nile (Thurguang)”

1.0.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">The aim of this report is to outline for JMEC the results of investigations
into the above allegation with an assessment and recommendations.
</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">1.1  Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">

</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">•</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">On8</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">February 2016 the JTC ordered the MVT based at Melut to investigate
the allegation.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">Once arrangements had been made with UNMISS for the
provision of force protection the MVT drove to Jalhak on 19 February in order
to undertake the investigation.

</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">•</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">When in Jalhak the MVT visited the scene of the alleged shelling, which was
an area of the town called Mina Jalhak.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">The area was devoid of civilians due
to the shelling, and the MVT observed burnt houses and signs of mortar
impacts.

</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">•</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">The team interviewed witnesses and took statements from local Government
Forces officers.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">They were unable in this instance to make contact with

SPLM/A-lO affiliated forces on the western bank of the Nile.

2.0  VIOLATIONS OF THE PCTSA

2.1  </a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">According to witnesses the attack took place on about the 27" January and
consisted of the firing of mortars into the Mina Jalhac area.  </a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">The mortars were
fired from the western side of the Nile over the main part of Jalhac town to impact
in Mina Jalhak.

22.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">Anumber of houses caught fire, and the local residents fled elsewhere.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">Local
sources told the MVT that 700 people have been displaced by the incident, and
they remain reluctant to return in case the shelling is repeated.

2.2.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">There were no casualties reported.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">

</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">

3.1  Itis the assessment of CTSAMM that the shelling did take place, and that houses
were burnt and civilian lives endangered as a result.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">

32 The area from where the mortars were fired is under the control of forces aligned
with the SPLM/A-IO, and it is therefore the clear view of CTSAMM that SPLM/A-
IO forces are responsible for a violation of the PCTSA.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">

</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">4.0  Conclusion

4.1  Itis the opinion of JTC that forces allied to the SPLM/A-IO violated article 1.0  of
the PCTSA, particularly:</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">

</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">•</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">Article 1.1  of the COHA:</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">“The Parties hereby agree to cease all military
actions aimed at each other...”

•</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">Article 1.2.c.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">of the COHA:</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">“...ensure that all forces or armed groups under
their influence, control or/and command shall observe this Agreement.”

•</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Article 1.3.5:</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">“Acts of hostility, intimidation, violence or attacks against the
civilian population......”..</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">This is because the mortar shells fell in a civilian
area.

5.0  Recommendations and observations:</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">

5.1  CTSAMM recommends that JMEC remind the Parties that it is vital that all allied
forces are made fully aware of the provisions of the Agreement and abide by
them.

5.2.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">The area in which the mortar shells landed was occupied by civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">It is
impossible to say whether this was deliberate or not, but certainly those firing the
mortars did so without taking into account the danger to civilian lives.
