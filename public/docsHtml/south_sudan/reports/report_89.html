Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring Mechanism
CTSAMM REPORT NUMBER 051
SGBV IN THE YEI AREA
Executive Summary

</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">In the month of July 2017 over 20 cases of rape by soldiers from both SPLA-IO (RM)
and SPLA-IG were recorded by the medical authorities in Yei.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">These 20 cases
represent only a small proportion of rapes that take place - many women are too scared
or feel too ashamed to report such cases, and those taken to or resident in areas
controlled by the SPLA-IO (RM) are not easily able to report or seek medical attention.
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">The scale and nature of SGBV committed by uniformed men in the Yei area is clearly
unacceptable by any standards, as is the impunity that the perpetrators seemingly
enjoy.

</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">Soldiers from both SPLA-IO (RM) and SPLA-IG are in clear violation of the PCTSA in
respect of their treatment of women in the area.

<p><a id="17" name="17">SGBV IN THE YEI AREA
1.0  Introduction
1.1. .</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">

</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">•</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">CTSAMM has for many months been reporting on the situation in the Yei
area.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">Civilians are suffering, and many have fled to Uganda.

</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">•</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">One recurrent theme of CTSAMM reporting has been the amount of SGBV —
specifically rape — that women in the area have been subjected to.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">During
the last CTSAMM meeting on 20 July we presented a monitoring report which
outlined  alleged cases of rape by SPLA-IG personnel.

</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">•</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">During the recent patrol to Yei more evidence of the scale of SGBV in the
area came to light, particularly horrific cases perpetrated by SPLA-IO (RM)
soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">

1.2  </a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">The purpose of this report is to attempt to outline the scale of SGBV in the
_</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">Yei area, illustrate the issue with reference to specific cases and attribute
responsibility where possible.
1.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">

</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">•</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The evidence covered in this report comes from the first part of a patrol to the
Yei area from  to  August 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">The patrol continued until 17 August, and
the finding of the second part of the patrol will be presented at the next
CTSAMM meeting.

</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">•</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">The Yei MVT was accompanied during the patrol by the CTSAMM Gender
Adviser, who has specific expertise in the area of SGBV.

</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">•</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">Evidence was collected through interviews with local people and from
information given by medical professionals.
2.0  Findings
2.1  </a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">In the month of July over 20 cases of rape were reported, which, according to
_ medical personnel, is a normal monthly number.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">These were rapes committed
by soldiers from both SPLA-IO (RM) and SPLA-IG.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">It must be emphasised that
many people are too scared or too ashamed to report rape cases, and it is
assumed that the figure of 20 represents only a proportion of the total number of
rapes that have taken place.
</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">2.2  Examples:</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">In order to illustrate the suffering these women have gone through,
the MVT provided the following four examples of cases reported to the hospital

and authorities in July 2017:</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">Awoman was admitted to hospital in a critical condition.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">In February she had
been abducted by SPLM-IO (RM) soldiers whilst farming, and repeatedly
sexually assaulted by  soldiers from February to July.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">She managed to
escape.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">She told the authorities that three more women were abducted with
her and they are still in the SPLA-IO (RM) camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">The woman had been

"subject to extreme mental and physical suffering.

</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">•</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">Awoman working in the fields near Yei was abducted and raped by SPLA-IO
(RM) soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">She was made to call her husband and tell him to bring money
to secure her release, but she has not been heard of again.

</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">•</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">There were reports of groups of women being stripped, humiliated and
harassed by SPLA-IO (RM) soldiers, and then being left without clothes to
return naked to their homes.

</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">•</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">«</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">A woman of 60 was sexually assaulted by two SPLA-IG soldiers near Yei.
</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">She was too scared to report the case to the police, and the same two soldiers

have continued to be seen moving around the area.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">In another case an SPLA-
IG soldier in uniform was seen beating a woman severely.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">She was rescued
by her neighbours and the case reported to the police, but no action has been
taken against the soldier responsible.

2.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Women in the Yei area are scared of soldiers from both SPLA-IO (RM) and

_</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">SPLA-IG.

</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">

3.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">The treatment of women by SPLA-IO (RM) soldiers is appalling.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">It is apparent
there are cases of women being abducted and effectively used as sex slaves by
soldiers in the bush.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">Given limited liaison with SPLA-IO (RM) forces it is difficult
for CTSAMM to address this issue, but the MVT will continue to monitor the
situation and report cases as they occur.

3.2.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">It is apparent that SPLA-IG soldiers in the Yei area have little discipline and can
act with impunity in their relations with local women.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">

</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">4.0  Conclusion:</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">

4.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">“It is the clear conclusion of CTSAMM that particularly soldiers from SPLA-IO
(RM) but also those of SPLA-IG are in clear violation of Article 1.0.2.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">of the
PCTSA:</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">“Acts and forms of sexual and gender-based violence, including sexual
exploitation and harassment...”

5.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">

5.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">The suffering of women in the Yei area is clearly unacceptable by any standards,
and it is a terrible indictment of all parties to the current conflict that they allow
such appalling abuses.

</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">5.2.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">Under the current circumstances it is difficult for CTSAMM to engage with SPLA-
1O (RM) in order to confront the issue of SGBV in the areas they control.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">In order
that individual cases can be raised and resolved, it is important that there is
contact and liaison.

5.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">To avoid further alienation of the civilian population in the Yei area, SPLA-IG
soldiers who commit rape or other sexual offenses should not only be disciplined
but also be seen to be disciplined.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">We refer not only to the instances described
in this report, but also those outlined at the last CTSAMM meeting.
