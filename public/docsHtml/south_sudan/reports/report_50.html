</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">This Report on the status of implementation of the activities of the Revitalised Agreement 
on  the  Resolution  of  the  Conflict  in  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan  (R-ARCSS)  is  prepared 
pursuant  to  Chapter  VII,  Article  7.9  of  the  R-ARCSS  and  covers  the  period  1st  July  to  30th 
September  2020.  </a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">The  Report  highlights  the  most  recent  progress  on  the  Pre-Transitional 
activities carried over after the initial formation of the Revitalised Transitional Government of 
National  Unity  (RTGoNU)  </a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">on  22nd  February  2020,  as  well  as  the  tasks  scheduled  to  be 
undertaken in the Transitional Period.  

 
</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">During the reporting period, very little progress was made on the implementation of these 
outstanding tasks, with exception of the issue of responsibility sharing at the State and local 
government levels.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">The Parties reached agreement on the allocations including positions for 10 
Deputy Governors, 10 Speakers, their deputies and 51 members of the State Assemblies, 17 
Ministers, 5 State Advisors, 6 Chairpersons, 79 County Commissioners, 35 County Councils, 
6  Commission  Deputies  and  8  specialized  committees  in  each  State.  </a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">However,  full 
establishment  of  the  governance  structure  at  the  sub-national  level  was  delayed  despite  this 
initial agreement, relating mainly to eleven positions for County Commissioners including in 
the Ruweng and Pibor Administrative areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">

 
The  Legislative  arm  of  the  RTGoNU  is  yet  to  be  reconstituted.  </a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">The    36th  Extraordinary 
Meeting  of  the  IGAD  Heads  of  State  and  Government  held  in  July  2020  appealed  to  the 
President  of  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan  to  dissolve  the  current  Transitional  National 
Legislative Assembly (TNLA) before 26th July 2020;</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">and the Parties to reconstitute the TNLA 
within  seven  (7)  days  of  its  dissolution.  </a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">However,  the  TNLA  is  yet  to  be  dissolved  and  its 
expansion and reconstitution has been delayed.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">The Summit also called upon the R-TGoNU to 
take  remedial  measures  to  immediately  rectify  the  alterations  made  to  the  Constitutional 
Amendment Bill.  </a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">These measures were initiated by the NCAC in order to rectify the alterations 
and submitted to the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs for review.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52"> 

 
 </a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">The  Permanent  Ceasefire  is  largely  holding  without  major  skirmishes  among  the 
Signatories.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">However, during the third quarter minor clashes were reported between the South 
Sudan  People’s  Defence  Forces  (SSPDF)  and  the  Sudan  People’s  Liberation  Army  –  In 
Opposition  (SPLA-IO)  elements  in  Northern  Bahr  El  Ghazal.  </a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">The  clashes  led  to  scores  of 
fatalities and numerous casualties on both sides, as well as severe disruption and displacement 
to the civilian population.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">At the same time, inter communal violence continued in the Jonglei 
and  Greater  Pibor  area,  but  was  later  brought  under  control  by  a  High-level  Committee 
appointed  by  the  President  and  led  by  Vice  President  Wani  </a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Igga  to  resolve  intercommunal 
disputes.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">

 
</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Violation of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement 2017 and the Rome Declaration (2020) 
by the SSPDF, SPLA-IO, and the National Salvation Front (NAS) continued in the Equatorias. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">The  armed  clashes  led  to  scores  of  civilian  fatalities  and  the  displacement  of  thousands  of 
civilians  in  the  Equatorias.  </a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">There  were  also  continuous  sexual  and  gender-based  violence 

 

  
 iii 

(SGBV) incidents linked to the fighting.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">In response, the SSPDF leadership launched a District 
Court  Martial  process  to  hold  accountable  members  of  the  SSPDF  who  may  have  been 
culpable.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">As a result, 26 soldiers were convicted for offences against civilians and violations 
of the SSPDF military code of conduct.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">The soldiers found guilty of rape or sexual assault have 
been sentenced to a period ranging from 6 to 14 years in prison and dismissal from the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65"> 

 
</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">The food security situation in South Sudan remains grim with more than 7 million people 
acutely  food  insecure.  </a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">The  magnitude  and  severity  of  the  food  insecurity  steadily  rose  as 
household  food  access  became  increasingly  constrained  by  rising  food  prices,  and  the 
continued depreciation of the South Sudanese Pound (SSP).</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">The situation was worsened by 
the impact of COVID 19, and impassable roads due to heavy rains.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">Food security was further 
threatened by an incursion of a swarm of locusts into eastern Equatoria, an outbreak of fall 
armyworms  in  Magwi  County  in  Eastern  Equatoria,  and  inhibited  humanitarian  access 
resulting from the armed  clashes between SSPDF, SPLA/IO and NAS forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">

 
</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">The RJMEC Interim Chairperson addressed virtual meetings of the IGAD Heads of State 
and Governments and the African Union Peace and Security Council (AUPSC), in which he 
outlined  the  current  status  of  implementation  and  recommended  that:</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72"> </a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">the  Parties  move  to 
speedily  appoint  the  Upper  Nile  governor;</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74"> </a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">the  reconstitution  of  the  TNLA  be  undertaken 
immediately;</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">the training, graduation and redeployment of the Necessary Unified Forces move 
ahead;</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77"> </a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">the  authorities  initiate  dialogue  at  the  grassroots  level  in  order  to  address  inter-
communal  violence;</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79"> </a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">and  the  Africa  Union  continue  to  pursue  establishment  of  the  Hybrid 
Court.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">In addition,  the RJMEC leadership held  meetings with  H.E Salva Kiir,  President, Dr 
Riek Machar Teny, First Vice President, and the four Vice Presidents of the Republic of South 
Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">

 
There are ongoing risks and challenges to implementation of the R-ARCSS including the 
Covid-19 disruptions, lack of resources for redeployment of the NUF, intercommunal clashes, 
growing incidents of defections of the forces within the parties, persistent NAS attacks in the 
Equatorias, and limited efforts at tackling the Transitional Period tasks.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">To date, none of the 
187 activities expected to be conducted during the Transitional Period has taken place.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">Worse, 
the  two  key  Pre-Transitional  tasks  brought  over  into  the  Transitional  Period  that  of  the 
reconstituting  of  the  TNLA  and  completion  of  the  security  arrangements;</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85"> </a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">continue  to  trail 
implementation with no clear timetable for them being accomplished.  

 
</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">It is critical that the pre-transitional tasks as well as those still outstanding in governance, 
security, the economy, humanitarian assistance, and transitional justice issues be given serious 
attention.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">These provisions when implemented will pave the way for the state building process 
in  South  Sudan.  </a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">Meanwhile,  a  good  number  of  the  deadlines  have  elapsed  with  little  or  no 
progress in implementation since the commencement of the Transitional Period.

I. Introduction 

1.        </a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">This Report on the status of implementation of the tasks of the Revitalised Agreement on 
the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) is prepared pursuant 
to Chapter VII, Article 7.9 of the R-ARCSS and covers the period 1st July to 30th September 
2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">It builds on the previous quarterly reports published since the signing of the R-ARCSS 
on 12th September 2018, namely numbers 001/19, 002/19, 003/19, 004/19, 005/19, 006/20 and 
007/20.1 

 
2.        </a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">During  the  last  quarter,  very  little  progress  was  made  on  the  implementation  of  the 
outstanding  Pre-Transitional  period  tasks,  which  were  moved  to  the  Transitional  Period.  </a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">2  
However, there was some progress made in finally resolving the issue of responsibility sharing 
at  the  State  and  local  government  levels.  </a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">The  Report  highlights  the  continued  challenges  to 
implementation, including lack of progress in implementing key aspects of the chapters related 
to the economy and that of transitional justice, while outlining where some progress has been 
made.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">In addition, the status of implementation is discussed within the broader context of inter 
communal violence, the COVID-19 Pandemic, and the ongoing humanitarian challenges facing 
the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">

 

3.        </a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">Also  highlighted  in  the  Report  is  the  ongoing  work  of  the  National  Constitutional 
Amendment  Committee  (NCAC),  the  various  security  mechanisms,  progress  made  by  the 
Reconstituted Transitional Government of National Unity (R-TGoNU), specific efforts made 
by the Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (RJMEC) in encouraging 
implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS,  and  recent  efforts  by  the  authorities  to  tackle  sexual  and 
gender based violence (SGBV).  </a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">The humanitarian situation is discussed in some detail with the 
worsening of the flood situation, and a slow down to the voluntary return of Internally Displaced 
Persons (IDPs).   

 

4.       </a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">The  Report  also  highlights  the  specific  intervention  of  the  IGAD  Council  of  Ministers  in 
urging action on the part of RTGoNU to implement key aspects of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">In that regard 
RJMEC’s intervention both with the Summit and the Africa Union Peace and Security Council 
is outlined.  

 
</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">5.        Section II of the Report will provide greater detail on the status of implementation of the R-
ARCSS  with  regards  to  progress  or  the  lack  thereof,  and  based  on  the  various  Agreement 
chapters, Section III presents RJMEC’s observations and recommendations, and concludes with 
Section IV.

implementation of the R-ARCSS since its signing in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. 
2 When the Transitional Period commenced on 22 February 2020, the Parties agreed to tackle the Pre-Transitional 
tasks related to the reconstitution of the Transitional Legislature, the training and deployment of the Necessary 
Unified Forces, and responsibility sharing at the State and local government levels;</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">during the Transitional Period. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">With the exception of responsibility sharing the other two tasks remain largely unimplemented.

accomplished during the past quarter.</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">It also includes the outstanding governance issues from 
previous periods.</a></p>

Signatories.</a></p>
<p><a id="210" name="210">However, during the third quarter minor clashes were reported between the South 
Sudan  People’s  Defence  Forces  (SSPDF)  and  the  SPLA-IO  elements  in  Northern  Bahr  El 
Ghazal, presumably as a result of miscommunication during the civilian disarmament operation 
by the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="211" name="211">There were clashes between the SSPDF and armed youth that led to scores of 
fatalities and numerous casualties on both sides, as well as severe disruption and displacement 
to the civilian population.</a></p>
<p><a id="212" name="212">This consequently led to the abandonment of the operation by the

Gorumuk  with  reports  of  rampant  destruction  of  institutional  buildings  and  infra-structure.6 
However, the situation was later brought under control by a High-level Committee appointed 
by the President and led by Vice President Wani Igga to resolve intercommunal disputes in 
Jonglei and Pibor areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="216" name="216">The thirteen- member committee was established on 23 June 2020 and 
made its first visit to the Pibor area in early July.7  An outstanding matter of contention is the

<p><a id="218" name="218">Armed clashes between the NAS and the SSPDF, as

<p><a id="416" name="416">This has complimented the naming of the nine state governors.</a></p>
<p><a id="417" name="417">However, it is 
important that the impasse over the naming of the governor for Upper Nile be resolved so that 
the process can be completed.

<p><a id="418" name="418">Concerning  the  completion  of  training,  graduation  and  redeployment  of  the  NUF,  this 
remains well behind schedule.</a></p>
<p><a id="419" name="419">Although tens of thousands of troops reported to the cantonment 
sites and training centres, the conditions in which they exist are austere, with numerous reports 
of troops leaving them in search of food.</a></p>
<p><a id="420" name="420">However, there is evidence of the spirit of unification, 
comradeship, a sense of esprit de corps that should be capitalised upon, and should not be left 
to fade.</a></p>
<p><a id="421" name="421">Also connected to the unification of forces are preparations for DDR for ex-combatants. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="422" name="422">Unfortunately,  these  do  not  seem  to  have  advanced  in  recent  months,  despite  our  continued 
urging  for  progress  on  the  matter.    </a></p>
<p><a id="423" name="423">It  is  therefore  hoped  that  the  RJMEC  organised  DDR-
workshop held recently, will focus  the responsibility for DDR at the RTGoNU Presidency and 
Governance  Cluster  levels,  and  that  the  much  needed  coordination  between  the  NTC,  DDR 
Commission and the Security Mechanisms is established and sustained.

<p><a id="424" name="424">Inter communal violence is identified as a major risk factor, at this time, to the successful 
implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="425" name="425">The persistent violence has resulted in scores of death and 
thousands  of  civilians  have  fled  their  homes  seeking  security  elsewhere.  </a></p>
<p><a id="426" name="426">Wherever  such 
subnational  conflict  takes  place,  humanitarian  access  and  safety  are  usually  impaired.  </a></p>
<p><a id="427" name="427">At 
present, this situation is exacerbated by country-wide flooding, which has increased the need 
for  civilian  protection  and  food  security.  </a></p>
<p><a id="428" name="428">In  that  regard,  the    Committee  to  investigate  the 
violence,  which  is  headed  by  Dr  Wani  </a></p>
<p><a id="429" name="429">Igga,  is  considered  a  valuable  initiative,  and  it  is 
important  that  further  grassroots  dialogue  initiatives  be  developed  country-wide  at  the  local 
level, to help identify the drivers of community-based conflicts, to inform their resolution and 
transformation.

<p><a id="430" name="430">Recent  action  by  the  leadership  of  the  SSPDF  linked  to  the  District  court  martials  is  a 
commendable step to bringing an end to SGBV in South Sudan.  </a></p>
<p><a id="431" name="431">The action taken in punishing 
offenders sends a very strong message to those who would otherwise commit these despicable 
acts.</a></p>
<p><a id="432" name="432">Therefore, the military leadership of the SSPDF, SPLM/A-IO, and SSOA are encouraged 
to  continue  to  educate  their  forces  on  the  provisions  of  the  R-ARCSS,  and  implement  their 
respective  Action  Plan  on  addressing  conflict-related  Sexual  Violence.  </a></p>
<p><a id="433" name="433">With  regards  to  the 
Equatorias, the fighting has destabilised the area, a situation compounded by reports of rape and 
violence against women.</a></p>
<p><a id="434" name="434">In that regard, the Parties are strongly urged to cease all hostilities and 
to align their actions consistent with their commitments outlined in the Cessation of Hostilities 
Agreement signed in Addis Ababa in 2017 and the Rome Declaration of January 2020.</a></p>

<p><a id="436" name="436">Concerning implementation of Chapter V as it relates to Transitional Justice issues, RJMEC 
urges  the  RTGoNU  to  initiate  engagement  with  the  UN,  AU  and  African  Commission  on

Peoples  and  Human  Rights  (ACPHR)  with  a  view  to  identifying  areas  of  support  and 
collaboration.</a></p>
<p><a id="437" name="437">In addition, RTGoNU should support efforts to fast track the establishment of the 
Hybrid Court of South Sudan and engagement with RTGoNU on complementary transitional

including women’s rights violations.</a></p>

63.     </a></p>
<p><a id="441" name="441">Even  as  discussions  continue  amongst  the  parties  on  the  need  to  revisit  the  Agreement 
timelines on account of the Covid-19 disruptions, it is critical that the Pre-Transitional tasks as 
well as those still outstanding in governance, security, the economy, humanitarian assistance, 
and transitional justice issues be given serious attention.</a></p>
<p><a id="442" name="442">These provisions when implemented 
will pave the way for the state building process in South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="443" name="443">Meanwhile, a good number of 
the  deadlines  have  elapsed  with  little  or  no  progress  in  implementation  since  the 
commencement of the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="444" name="444">Importantly, institutional reforms, implementation 
of  existing  laws  to  ensure  transparency  and  accountability,  law  reforms,  and  other  policy 
reviews, all need to be acted upon for the success of implementation and to help put the country 
on a sustained path to the holding of free and fair elections. 

  
</a></p>
<p><a id="445" name="445">64.      RJMEC on its part shall continue to impartially monitor, evaluate and report as it carries out 
its oversight responsibilities with regards to the implementation of the R-ARCSS, and intervene 
whenever necessary.</a></p>
<p><a id="446" name="446">RJMEC will also continue providing regular reports and briefings to the 
RTGoNU, the TNLA, the Chairperson of the IGAD Council of Ministers, the Chairperson of 
the African Union Commission, the AU Peace and Security Council, and to the UN Secretary-
General and the United Nations Security Council.
