2.0  Investigation / Verification Methodology
2.1      Employing Monitoring and Verification Mechanism (MVM) Standard Operating
Procedures, the MVTs based in UNMISS camps in Bentiu, Malakal and Bor initiated the
investigation / verification sequence with Flash Reports and Daily Situation Reports over the
period 27 April — 05 May.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">Subsequently, the JTC formally issued Investigation and Verification
Orders to MVT Bentiu on  May, and to MVTs in Bor and Malakal on  May, following
direction from the JTC Chairman.
</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">2.2      The MVTs conducted investigations in accordance with the orders, in order to augment
the information already provided and corroborate reports received from other sources.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">The
results of initial investigations were three MVT Investigations and Verification Reports on 
and  May.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">This report is based on the combined analysis of all reports and evidence received
by the JTC up until O900hrs on 09 May 2014.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">All relevant MVT reports are referenced in this
document and available for additional scrutiny, if required.

3.2    The advancing Government Forces passed the UNMISS compound in Rubkona at
approximately 1430hrs.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">Government Forces then continued to advance, with little resistance,
before a lull in the early evening.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">However, sporadic gunfire could be heard throughout the

rescue personnel and equipment still engaged in fighting in the outskirts of the town.

Government Force attack, but JTC government force representatives indicate that Major
Generals Santino Deng Wol and Magok Magok Deng were also commanding Government

on 04 May and, as such, failed to cease all military actions in accordance with the COHA.
</a></p>

4.2     JTC assessments indicate that the Government Forces initiated an engagement
resulting in violence against men, women and children, in violation of the COHA.
5.0  Main Events — Nassir (Upper Nile State)®

<p><a id="67" name="67">Heavy firing continued between the forces loyal to both parties, and by approximately
1500hrs Government Forces had control over Nassir and the surrounding area.
</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">5.2      On 05 May 14, at around 1700hrs, heavy fighting began between the Government and
SPLM/A IO Forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">SPLM/A IO Forces began firing across the River Sobat while Government

5.4    Government Forces in Nassir and Ketbek are estimated to number approximately
,500 — ,000 with two tanks and a number of armored personnel carriers.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">Unconfirmed
reports indicate the commanders of Government Forces include Brigadiers Justin Nhial

<p><a id="72" name="72">The
commander of the SPLM/A-IO Forces in the area is believed to be Brigadier Chuol Gaga
Lolongo.
6.0  Assessment - Nassir (Upper Nile State)

04 May and, as such, failed to cease all military actions in accordance with the COHA.

7.0  Main Events - Ayod (Jonglei State)®
7.1      Unconfirmed reports indicate that on 27 April Government Forces attacked the town of
Ayod in Ayod County.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">Unconfirmed reports also indicate that from 28-30 April SPLM/A-lO
Forces attacked areas in Duk County (including Padiat, Payuel, Marang, Poktar and Patnoi).
</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">However, only speculative details are available due to a lack of credible and impartial
witnesses.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">Initial investigations were hampered by the inability of the MVT to verify the events
in the specified areas, because of insecurity.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">Investigations continue.
</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">8.0  Assessment — Ayod (Jonglei State)
8.1      Investigations relating to the potential violation of the Cessation of Hostilities
Agreement in Duk and Ayod Counties, Jonglei State, were inconclusive.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">Therefore,
apportioning responsibilities for violations of the COHA to either of the parties, in this situation,
is not currently possible.
</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">9.0  Conclusion
9.1     JTC and MVT investigations, verification, evidence collection and analytical processes
indicate that Government Forces committed violations of the COHA in two main categories in
Bentiu (Unity State) and Nassir (Upper Nile State) on 04 May 2014:</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">
</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">•</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">1.0-1.1(inclusive) Declaration of Cessation of Hostilities
•</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">3.0, 3.1  and 3.2  Protection of Civilians

9.0     The subsequent affect of the Government Force attack on Bentiu on 04 May was the
cancellation of humanitarian flights on 04 and 05 May, which violates 4.0, 4.1  and 4.2 
Humanitarian Access of the COHA.
</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">9.0      It is therefore recommended that the IGAD Special Envoys take the appropriate action
against the Government of the Republic of South Sudan in response to the violations of the
Cessation of Hostilities Agreement.
