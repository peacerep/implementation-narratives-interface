<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 6 and 19 September, the SMM recorded an increase in the number of cease-

fire violations – 3,742 compared with 2,494 in the previous two-week period. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  Mission  continued  to  monitor  the  disengagement  areas  near  Stanytsia  Luhanska, 

Zolote and Petrivske, recording 78 ceasefire violations inside the area near Petrivske. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  SMM  corroborated  reports  of  six  civilian  casualties,  four  of  these  were  due  to 
shelling; one shrapnel injury; and one due to the detonation of an explosive device. This 
brings the total number of confirmed civilian casualties since the beginning of 2021 to 
68  (15  fatalities  and  53  injuries).  Thirty-seven  of  these  casualties  were  due  to  mines, 
unexploded ordnance and other explosive objects, nine due to small-arms fire and 22 
due to shelling.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The Mission followed up on reports of damage to civilian properties on both sides of the 
contact line. Since the beginning of the year, the SMM has confirmed damage to 103 
civilian properties and infrastructure sites. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The Mission’s freedom of movement was restricted 22 times, including 21 instances in 
non-government-controlled  areas.  SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAVs)  were  as-
sessed  as  targeted  by  small-arms  fire  nine  times:  two  times  in  government-controlled 
and seven in non-government-controlled areas. SMM UAVs experienced signal interfer-
ence  assessed  as  caused  by  probable  jamming  on  122 occasions,  while  flying  on  both 
sides of the contact line. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The  Mission  continued  to  observe  civilians  while  crossing,  or  attempting  to  cross,  the 
contact line and the challenges they face. The SMM again noted that the only crossing 
points open to civilian use were near Stanytsia Luhanska, open daily, and Novotroitske/
Olenivka, open twice a week, as the corresponding checkpoint of the armed formations 
is open for crossing only on Mondays and Fridays. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The SMM continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to ena-
ble repairs and operation of critical civilian infrastructure on both sides of the contact 
line, including to a power supply station near Betmanove (former Krasnyi Partyzan), a 
power  substation  near  Zaitseve  and  power  lines  in Verkhnotoretske,  altogether  bene-
fitting around 7,000 civilians.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">  The SMM issued its latest  thematic report on the gender  dimensions of the Mission’s 
monitoring, focusing on women-led peacebuilding initiatives and the effects of the con-
flict in eastern Ukraine on the lives of women and girls.
