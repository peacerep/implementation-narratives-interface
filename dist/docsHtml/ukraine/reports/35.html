</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1"> The  recommitment  to  the  ceasefire  on  30  March  has  yielded  insignificant  results,  with  a 
7 percent  decrease  in  the  number  of  ceasefire  violations  (9,300)  recorded  by  the  OSCE  SMM 
between  2  and  15  April,  compared  with  the  previous  reporting  period.    </a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">Violence  increased 
notably  during  the  second  week  of  this  reporting  period,  particularly  in  and  around 
Staromykhailivka and in the Kuibyshevskyi district of Donetsk city on 10 and 11 April, resulting 
in  the  injury  of  at  least  five  civilians.  </a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">The  joint  statement  by  the  OSCE  Chairperson’s  Special 
Representative Martin Sajdik and the OSCE SMM Chief Monitor Ertugrul Apakan called on the 
sides to fully  adhere to the ceasefire,  saying the senseless shelling of residential areas  served 
only to endanger civilians.</a></p>

<p><a id="6" name="6"> The  Chief  Monitor,  along  with  the  OSCE  Project  Co-ordinator  in  Ukraine  Vaidotas  Verba,  in 
marking  International  Mine  Awareness  Day  on  4  April,  also  called  on  the  sides  to  fulfil  their 
mine action commitments.</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">Their failure to do so has resulted in 11 civilian deaths and 18 civilian 
injuries so far this year.</a></p>

<p><a id="11" name="11"> Mines  and  unexploded  ordnance  continued  to  impede  SMM  patrols.  </a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">Members  of  the  armed 
formations  in  Luhansk  region  also  continued  to  restrict  SMM  access to border areas  near the 
Russian  Federation  not  controlled  by  the  Government.  </a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">For  the  ninth  consecutive  week,  SMM 
unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAV)  continued  to  be  subject  to  small-arms  fire  and  the  recently      
re-launched  long-range  SMM  UAVs  were  subject  to  jamming  on  a  number  of  occasions.  </a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">Of 
particular concern was an incident on 5 April, when a member of an armed formation, with a 
charged  assault  rifle,  threatened  SMM  monitoring  officers.  </a></p>
