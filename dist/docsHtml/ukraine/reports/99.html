<p><a id="0" name="0">  Following the re-commitment to ceasefire to mark “International Children’s Day” on  1  June,  and  an  accompanying  one-day  lull  in  violence,  both  Donetsk  and Luhansk  regions  witnessed  upsurges  in  violence. For  example,  on  3-4  June,  the SMM  observed  artillery  and  mortar  fire  exchanges  between  the  Trudivske neighbourhood Krasnohorivka;  and  on  5-6  June  use  of  artillery,  including multiple-launch  rocket     systems in the Zholobok-Krymske area of Luhansk region. in  Petrovskyi  district  of  Donetsk  city  and  neighbouring

<p><a id="1" name="1">  Over the period 29 May-12 June, the SMM confirmed 21 civilian casualties, one of whom was killed. This brings the total number of civilian casualties confirmed by the SMM in 2017 to 261, including 45 fatalities. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  SMM  observed  damage  to  crucial  civilian  infrastructure  in  eastern  Ukraine. For  example, shelling around the Donetsk  Filtration Station left Avdiivka, part  of Donetsk city and Yasynuvata without potable water until the SMM monitored and facilitated  its  repair  on  6  and  7  June  (see  www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/322181). On 9 June, due to the cessation of operations of the water  pumping  station  in  Vasylivka  allegedly  caused  by  shelling,  two  water      filtration  stations  had  no  water  supply  and  the  Donetsk  Filtration  Station  was  operating  under  emergency  mode.  On  10  June,  the  SMM  monitored  a  localised ceasefire,  coordinated  with  JCCC,  to  facilitate  repairs  to  the  water  pumps  in Vasylivka (see www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/322726).

<p><a id="3" name="3">  Aggressive restrictions to the SMM’s freedom of movement continued, primarily in  non-government-controlled  areas.  For  example  on  7  June,  an  SMM  patrol  in the  Novoazovsk  area  was  physically  prevented  from  moving;  seven  vehicles   without licence plates occupied by armed men surrounded the patrol and kept it blocked  for  about  20  minutes  before  ordering  it  to  leave  the  area  (see: www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/322181).  In  addition,  the Mission’s  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  were  assessed  as  targeted  with  small-arms fire on three occasions, two of them in areas not under governmental control. No injuries or damage ensued. </a></p>
