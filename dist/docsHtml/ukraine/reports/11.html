<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 25 February and 10 March, the SMM recorded almost 15,700 ceasefire viola-tions  (compared  with  over  23,000  in  the  previous  two-week  period).  The  Mission  also observed 90 weapons in violation of the agreed withdrawal lines (62 in areas not con-trolled by the Government).  
</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  On 8 March, coinciding with International Women’s Day, a recommitment to the cease-fire made by the Trilateral Contact Group (TCG) came into effect. The SMM Chief Moni-tor and the Special Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office in Ukraine and in the  TCG  welcomed  the  recommitment  (https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/413648).  
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  daily  number  of  ceasefire  violations  decreased  following  the  recommitment,  by around 60 per cent on the first  day compared with the  previous seven-day daily aver-age.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The Mission confirmed that five civilians were injured during the reporting period. This brings the total number of civilian casualties since the beginning of the year to 14: two killed and 12 injured.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  Half  of  the  civilian  casualties  confirmed  this  year,  including  the  two  fatalities,  were  a result of mines or unexploded ordnance. Despite the obligation to remove all previously-laid mines contained in the Minsk Memorandum and the TCG’s  Decision on  Mine Ac-tion, the Mission continued to observe the presence of mines, including newly-laid ones.

<p><a id="5" name="5">  The position of weapons in and  the firing from and  into residential areas continues to endanger civilians. One man was injured in  shelling in Donetskyi, where the SMM also noted the presence of armoured combat vehicles and mortars. In Zolote, the SMM ob-served  fresh  damage  to  three  inhabited  houses  caused  by  shelling.  Three  infantry fighting vehicles were parked 10 metres from the houses. Two days later,  SMM moni-tors and water company repair workers on the edge of the village were forced to leave the area following small-arms fire nearby.</a></p>
