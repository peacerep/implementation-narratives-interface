<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  14  and  27  May  2018,  the  security  situation  in  the  east  of  Ukraine  deteriorated:  the 
OSCE SMM recorded almost  13,700 ceasefire violations along the contact line  – a  20 per cent 
increase from the previous reporting period. The number of ceasefire violations between 14 and 
20 May – 7,600 – was the highest recorded by the SMM this year.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The SMM corroborated 28 civilian casualties due to armed violence along the contact line: eight 
killed and 20 injured. This brings the total number of civilian casualties confirmed by the Mission 
this year to 107 civilian casualties, including 27 fatalities.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  SMM’s  freedom  of  movement  remained  restricted  due  to  the  presence  of  mines  and 
unexploded  ordnance  on  both  sides  of  the  contact  line.  In  addition  to  this,  the  Mission  faced 
other restrictions (mostly denial of access): 28 times by members of the armed formations and 
five times by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Members of the armed formations in Luhansk region 
continued to deny the SMM access to areas near the border with the Russian Federation.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The SMM continued to monitor the security situation and facilitate access for employees of the 
Voda Donbassa water company and others to and from the Donetsk Filtration Station (DFS) to 
keep  the  station  operational.  In  the  area  of  the  DFS,  the  SMM  observed  ceasefire  violations, 
despite  explicit  security  guarantees  given.  On  15  May,  SMM  patrol  members  heard  a  bullet 
flying  over  their  heads  (www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/381403).  In  his 
letter  to  the  signatories  of  the  Minsk  agreements  sent  on  15  May,  OSCE  SMM  Chief  Monitor 
Ertugrul  Apakan  called  for  an  immediate  cessation  of  ceasefire  violations  in  the  wider  area 
around the DFS (www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/382048).
