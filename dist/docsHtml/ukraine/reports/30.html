<p><a id="0" name="0"> Between 11 and 24 June, the security situation in eastern Ukraine remained volatile. The Mission recorded 
fewer ceasefire violations along the contact line – around 13,000, representing a 10 per cent decrease 
compared with the previous two-week reporting period. Also, the use of weapons that should have been 
withdrawn in accordance with the Minsk agreements decreased by 30 per cent.

<p><a id="1" name="1"> The SMM corroborated 16 civilian casualties due to armed violence, all of whom were injured. This brings 
the total number of civilian casualties confirmed by the Mission this year to 144, including 29 fatalities. 
Other cases are pending verification.

<p><a id="2" name="2"> The Mission’s unarmed civilian monitors continued to face a host of restrictions, risks and threats. In one 
incident on 14 June, in non-government-controlled Pikuzy, warning shots were fired 50m from SMM 
monitors (Spot Report: www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/384540). On 23 June, in nongovernment-controlled Petrivske, a member of the armed formations with an assault rifle (AK-74) forced the 
SMM to drive on a mine-contaminated road (Spot Report: www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-toukraine/385626). In addition, ground patrols were actively restricted 31 times; denied or delayed access, or 
only granted access conditionally – 29 times by members of the armed formations and twice by Ukrainian 
Armed Forces’ soldiers.

<p><a id="3" name="3"> The Mission’s aerial monitoring was subject to restrictions as well. On 15 June, over non-governmentcontrolled Betmanove, an SMM long-range unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was fired at by a surface-to-air 
missile system and an anti-aircraft gun. (Spot Report: https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-toukraine/384642). On 18 June, small-arms fire was directed at an SMM mini-UAV near Petrivske. On nine 
occasions, control over SMM UAVs was temporarily lost, most probably due to electronic jamming, on both 
sides of the contact line.
