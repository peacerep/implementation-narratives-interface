In  the  week  of  27  February  to  5  March,  the  SMM  monitored  a  significant  increase  in  the  number  of  ceasefire  violations  in  the  following  areas: east and north-east of Mariupol; areas located between Popasna, Pervomaisk and Troitske; the western and northern outskirts of Horlivka.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  From 20 to 26 February, the SMM observed 86 weapons in violation of withdrawal lines.  It  has  not  observed  any  withdrawal  of  weapons  from  the  security  zone,   despite repeated recommitments in this regard by the sides, including in February. Unless  the  sides  disengage  and  withdraw  weapons,  intense  violence  remains  an ever-present danger. In the week from 27  February to 5 March the use of Minsk-proscribed  weapons,  namely  mortars,  tanks,  and  artillery, increased by 230 per cent as compared with the previous week. including  MLRS,

The following day, however, the station was shelled, resulting yet again in a halt to operations.
