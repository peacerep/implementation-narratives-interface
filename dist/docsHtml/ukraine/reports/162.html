<p><a id="0" name="0">  The  OSCE  SMM  welcomed  the  decision  of  the  Trilateral  Contact  Group  on     disengagement of forces and hardware in three areas, namely Zolote, Stanytsia Luhanska  and  Petrivske.  In  line  with  its  mandate  the  SMM  will  monitor          disengagement in these areas; however, without access to the disengagement areas the SMM cannot verify adherence to the agreement.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  Spot reports issued in this period noted an explosion 100m from the SMM near Stanytsia  Luhanska  bridge  (www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/264271)  and  small-arms  fire  near  an  SMM  mini  unmanned  aerial  vehicle  near  Bohorodychne (www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/267526). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The OSCE SMM continued to monitor the ceasefire, noting the sidesâ€™ renewed commitment to adhere to the ceasefire on the occasion of the start of the new school year on 1 September. Since then, the SMM noted a decrease in the level of  violence,  with  occasional  flare-ups,  all  of  which  result  in  a  highly  volatile   situation.  The  Donetsk  airport-Yasynuvata-Avdiivka  triangle  remained  the     epicentre of violence. The situation was generally calm in the Luhansk region.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  Risk  factors  remained:  weapons  in  violation  of  withdrawal  lines;  mines,        unexploded  ordnance  and  explosive  remnants  of  war  present;  armed  forces and formations positioned dangerously close to one another. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  Freedom  of  movement  of  SMM  monitors  continued  to  be  restricted, particularly in areas not controlled by the Government. </a></p>
