<p><a id="0" name="0">  The security situation in eastern Ukraine remains tense. From 18 September to 
1  October  the  OSCE  SMM  registered  a  slight  increase  in  the  number  of       
ceasefire violations. Violence was concentrated around three hotspots: 1) the 
areas  south-west,  south  and  south-east  of  Svitlodarsk,  2)  the  areas  east  and 
north-east of Mariupol, and 3) the Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-Donetsk airport area.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  SMM  noted  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  civilian  casualties.  During  the 
reporting  period,  the  SMM  confirmed  seven  civilians  injured.  This  brings  the 
total number of civilian casualties in 2017 to 394, including 69 fatalities.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  SMM  monitors,  in  co-ordination  with  the  Joint  Centre  for  Control  and              

Co-ordination, contributed to an improved humanitarian situation through the 
facilitation  and  monitoring  of  localized  adherence  to  the  ceasefire.  From  18 
September  to  1  October,  these  “windows  of  silence”  allowed  for  repair  and 
maintenance work to the thermal power plant in Shchastia, water pipelines in 
Zolote,  water  wells  near  Krasnyi  Lyman  and  Stanytsia  Luhanska,  power  lines 
between  Yuzhna  Lomuvatka  and  Veselohorivka,  the  Petrivske  water  pumping 
station,  power  lines  just  east  of  Luhanske  and  water  supply  pipes  between 
Marinka and Oleksandrivka. In total, the Mission conducted at least 44 patrols 
in support of such activities on both sides of the contact line.
