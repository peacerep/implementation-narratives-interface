<p><a id="0" name="0"> Between  1  and  14  October,  the  SMM  confirmed  that  two  civilians  were  killed  in  shelling  (a 
mother and daughter in Zolote), and two were injured (a boy hit by shrapnel in a field close to 
Zolote and a man caught in a mine blast near Lutuhyne), all in Luhansk region. The Mission also 
confirmed that a man had been injured by a mine in Maiorove, in Donetsk region, before the 
reporting  period.  Since  the  beginning  of  the  year,  the  SMM  has  corroborated  204  civilian       
casualties (39 deaths and 165 injuries), including 29 children.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1"> The  SMM  recorded  almost  19,000  ceasefire  violations,  compared  with  less  than  9,000  in  the 
previous two weeks. The intensity of violence was particularly pronounced in the last few days 
of the reporting period, with the daily ceasefire violation rate averaging over 2,300.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> The  SMM  continued  to  observe  weapons  in  violation  of  the  agreed  withdrawal  lines  (55  over 

the two-week period (35 in areas not controlled by the Government)). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3"> Despite commitments by the sides to remove existing mines and not to lay new ones, the SMM 

observed recently-laid anti-tank mines in the Zolote area, including one in front of a house. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4"> The Mission noted the presence of personnel, hardware and trenches in disengagement areas.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5"> On  three  occasions  (9,  10  and  11-12  October),  an  SMM  long-range  unmanned  aerial  vehicle 
spotted vehicles, including an anti-aircraft gun and an armoured personnel carrier, entering and 
exiting  Ukraine  in  the  middle  of  the  night  via  an  unpaved  road  near  Manych,  in  a  non-
government-controlled  area  of  Donetsk  region  near  the  border  with  the  Russian  Federation 
where there are no border crossing facilities. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6"> OSCE SMM Chief Monitor Ertugrul Apakan, in response to the increased level of violence and 
civilian casualties, called for restraint, urging the sides to protect the population and to deliver 
on commitments to end the violence, specifically to withdraw weapons, disengage, demine and 
cease fire.
