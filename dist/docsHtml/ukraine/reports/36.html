<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 13 and 26 July, the SMM recorded about 8,000 ceasefire violations, including about 2,100 explosions, compared with approximately 5,200 and 1,700, respectively, in the previous two weeks.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The Mission corroborated reports of five civilian casualties, all injuries, bringing the total number since the beginning of 2020 to 60 – eight fatalities and 52 injuries. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The Mission continued monitoring the security situation in and around the three disen-gagement areas. While it observed a calm situation inside the disengagement area near Stanytsia Luhanska, it recorded ceasefire violations and continued spotting the presence of people inside the disengagement areas near Zolote and Petrivske. The SMM also saw a new military position and improvements to a former military-type position in the latter area. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  On  20  July,  explosions  occurred  close  to  SMM  patrols  near  Zalizne  (see  Spot  Report 38/2020) and Berezivske as they were monitoring adherence to localized ceasefires to enable repairs to civilian infrastructure. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMM continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to ena-ble repairs to, as well as construction and maintenance of, critical civilian infrastructure in  Donetsk  and  Luhansk  regions.  This  included  repairs  to  power  lines  between  Novo-zvanivka and Troitske, as well as repairs to water infrastructure near Pankivka and Yash-chykove, benefitting around 460,000 civilians on both sides of the contact line. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the SMM observed  limited numbers of civilians crossing the contact line at Stanytsia Luhanska bridge, with many refused entry because of resi-dency requirements, the operation of a list system or difficulties in downloading a self-isolation application. In Donetsk region, where entry-exit checkpoints are mostly open, corresponding checkpoints of the armed formations – except one, which operated only two days a week – remained closed, resulting in severely restricted movement and hard-ship for the civilian population. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The Mission’s freedom of movement was restricted 13 times, all but two times in non-government-controlled areas. SMM unmanned aerial vehicles were subjected to signal interference  on  both  sides  of  the  contact  line  on  36  occasions,  and  were  targeted  by small-arms  fire  six  times  (four  times  in  non-government-controlled  areas  and  twice  in government-controlled areas).</a></p>
