security situation throughout the country. It observed that while the number of 
ceasefire  violations  increased  between  19  and  25  December  2016,  this  was 
followed by a decrease in the subsequent two weeks.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  Between  19  December  2016  and  8  January  2017  approximately  half  of  all 
ceasefire  violations  occurred  in  areas  south-east  and  east  of  Svitlodarsk.  The 
remaining  ceasefire  violations  largely  took  place  in  four  other  hotspots:  areas 
east  and  north-east  of  Mariupol;  the  western  and  northern  outskirts  of      
Horlivka;  the  Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-Donetsk  airport  triangle;  and  areas  of       
western Luhansk region.
