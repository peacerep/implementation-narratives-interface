<p><a id="3" name="3"> Despite explicit security guarantees, ceasefire violations continued to be recorded dur-ing SMM-facilitated ‘windows of silence’ meant to enable the maintenance, repair and operation of essential civilian infrastructure.  In Stanytsia Luhanska, where the SMM has monitored the process of disengagement of forces and hardware since 26 June, the Mission observed the construction of a pedestri-an bypass bridge that will allow people to cross the contact line in the area while repairs to  the  broken  section  of  the  bridge  are  undertaken.  Other  preparations  for  the  repair work  continued,  such  as  demining  and  vegetation  clearance.  The  SMM  recorded  no ceasefire violations inside the disengagement area.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  Following  the  removal  by  the  armed  formations  of  an  obstacle,  on  19  September  the SMM was able to pass through the Zolote disengagement area along the T-1316 road for the first time since the end of June 2019. The SMM noted the presence of a refurbished military position and military hardware in the area.</a></p>
