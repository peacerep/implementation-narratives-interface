<p><a id="2" name="2">  Over the past two weeks, the SMM corroborated reports of two civilians injured due  to  detonations  of  explosive  objects  in  non-government-controlled  areas  of Luhansk region. This brings the total number of civilian casualties that have been confirmed since the beginning of 2021 to 39 (11 fatalities and 28 injuries).

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The Mission’s freedom of movement was restricted 28 times, 26 of which in non-government-controlled  areas.  SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAVs)  were  as-sessed  as  targeted  by  small-arms  fire  five  times  in  non-government-controlled areas. During the reporting period, the Mission’s UAVs experienced signal inter-ference  assessed  as  caused  by  probable  jamming  or  jamming  on  109  occasions on both sides of the contact line, including ten instances when long-range UAVs were affected.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  During the reporting period, the SMM continued to facilitate and monitor adher-ence to localized ceasefires to enable maintenance and operation of critical civil-ian infrastructure, including the operation of the pumping station near Vasylivka that provides water to about 1,200,000 civilians on both sides of the contact line. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The Mission continued to observe civilians while crossing, or attempting to cross, the contact line and their challenges. It again noted that the only crossing points civilians were able to use  were near Stanytsia Luhanska (open daily) and Novo-troitske/Olenivka (open twice a week, as the armed formations’ checkpoint there is only open on Mondays and Fridays). </a></p>
