<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 23 August and 5 September, the SMM recorded a decrease in the number of 

ceasefire violations – 2,494 compared with 2,966 in the previous two-week period. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The Mission continued to monitor the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, 

Zolote and Petrivske, recording 53 ceasefire violations inside the area near Petrivske. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The SMM corroborated reports of five civilian casualties, including a fatality, bringing 
the total number of confirmed civilian casualties since the beginning of 2021 to 62 (15 
fatalities and 47 injuries). Thirty-six of these casualties were due to mines, unexploded 
ordnance  and  other  explosive  objects,  nine  due  to  small-arms  fire  and  17  due  to 
shelling. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The Mission’s freedom of movement was restricted 30 times, including 27 instances in 
non-government-controlled  areas.  SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAVs)  were  as-
sessed  as  targeted  by  small-arms  fire  on  12  occasions:  two  times  in  government-
controlled  and  ten  times  in  non-government-controlled  areas.  The  Mission’s  UAVs 
experienced signal interference assessed as caused by probable jamming on 107 occa-
sions, while flying on both sides of the contact line. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  On 31 August, a SMM patrol of five Mission members heard projectiles passing above 
their heads and impact explosions nearby in non-government-controlled Oleksandriv-
ka, Donetsk region. The patrol safely left the area (see SMM Daily Report of 1 Septem-
ber 2021). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The Mission continued to observe civilians while crossing, or attempting to cross, the 
contact line and the challenges they face. The SMM again noted that the only crossing 
points civilians were able to use were near Stanytsia Luhanska, open daily, and Novo-
troitske/Olenivka,  open  twice  a  week,  as  the  corresponding  checkpoint  of  the  armed 
formations is open for crossing only on Mondays and Fridays. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The SMM continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to ena-
ble the maintenance and operation of critical civilian infrastructure, including repairs to 
the  phenol  sludge  reservoir  near  Nelipivka,  as  well  as  to  power  lines  near  Nevelske, 
Novoluhanske and in Krasnohorivka, all in Donetsk region. Since the beginning of the 
year,  the  Mission  has  facilitated  and  monitored  adherence  to  localized  ceasefires  to 
enable repairs and maintenance of 75 public infrastructure sites on both sides of the 
contact line (43 in Donetsk region and 32 in Luhansk region), providing water, electrici-
ty, gas and mobile communications to about five million civilians.
