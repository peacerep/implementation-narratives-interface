<p><a id="0" name="0">  The  security  situation  along  the  contact  line  in  eastern  Ukraine  has  seriously    deteriorated with the SMM registering over  1,000 ceasefire violations daily with recent spikes over 2,000. Shelling was concentrated in the traditional hotspots of the Donetsk airport-Yasynuvata-Avdiivka area, west and north of Horlivka, on the Debaltseve-Svitlodarsk  road,  areas  east  and  north-east  of  Mariupol,  and  in     western Luhansk region.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  Weapons  proscribed  by  the  Minsk  agreements  continued  to  be  used  in  high   numbers and the SMM registered an increase in the use of mortars, artillery and multiple launch rocket systems. The SMM continued to observe weapons missing from storage sites as well as the presence of weapons in violation of withdrawal lines.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  sides  continued  to endanger  civilians  by shelling  populated  areas as  well  as areas  close  to  crossing  routes.  Civilian  lives  were  also  jeopardized  by  the           positioning  of  weapons  and  hardware  close  to  residential  and  civilian                 infrastructure. Consequently the SMM observed an increase in civilian casualties following a  reduction in early September.
