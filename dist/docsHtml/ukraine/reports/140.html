<p><a id="0" name="0">  The situation in eastern Ukraine remained tense with the SMM registering an increase in 

the  number  of  ceasefire  violations  over  the  last  two  weeks.  The  violence  was                
concentrated around five areas:  the Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-Donetsk airport area; the area 
east of Mariupol; the area south-west, south and south-east of Svitlodarsk; the western, 
south-western and northern outskirts of Horlivka; and around Popasna-Pervomaisk.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  recorded  use  of  weapons  that  should  have  been  withdrawn  more  than  doubled    

between 10-16 July (481 instances) compared to the week before (157 instances). It then 
decreased in the week of 17-23 July (at least 88 instances). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  violence  resulted  in  a  number  of  civilian  casualties  with  three  people  killed  and   
eighteen injured from 10 July to 25 July. This brings the total number of civilian casualties 
confirmed by the SMM in 2017 to 330, including 59 fatalities.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The Mission’s freedom of movement continued to be restricted. The SMM continued to 
be denied access around “DPR”-controlled Novoazovsk, an area close to the border with 
the Russian Federation.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMM’s unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) were targeted on several occasions. On the 
evening  of  20  July  while  a  patrol  was  conducting  a  UAV  flight  in  the  Trudivskiy  area  of  
Petrovskyi district (15km south-west of Donetsk city centre), 17 shots of small-arms fire 
were heard 300-400m south-south-west of the patrol’s position, assessed as aimed at the 
UAV. On 21 July an SMM patrol launched a mini UAV in Yasynuvata and after five minutes 
heard  25  bursts  of  small-arms  fire  1-2km  south-south-west,  in  the  area  where  the  UAV 
was flying. On the same day, immediately after the SMM had launched its mini UAV in the 
area  of  the  Vasylivka  water  pumping  station,  the  patrol  heard  a  loud  undetermined     
explosion 100-200m north of its position. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  On 19 July, for the first time since 2015, the SMM was able to use the road M03 between 
Svitlodarsk and Debaltseve, as mines and obstacles were cleared on both sides due to the 
efforts of the Joint Centre for Control and Co-ordination and deminers, demonstrating the 
ability of the sides to implement their commitments.
