<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 22 March and 4 April 2021, the SMM recorded 3,922 ceasefire violations, com-pared with 1,260 in the previous two-week period. The level of violence was particularly high  on  2  and  3  April  when  the  Mission  recorded  1,170  and  1,355  ceasefire  violations, respectively.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  During the two-week reporting period the SMM corroborated three civilian casualties (all injuries) that occurred before measures to strengthen the ceasefire were enacted on 27 July 2020. In addition, the Mission confirmed four civilian casualties, including two fatali-ties, one of whom was a five-year-old boy. This brings the total number of civilian casual-ties since 27 July 2020 to 48 (12 killed and 36 injured). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  SMM  continued  to  monitor  the  disengagement  areas  near  Stanytsia  Luhanska, Zolote and Petrivske, observing people in the latter two areas. The Mission also spotted for the first time an extension to an existing trench inside the disengagement area near Zolote. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  On two occasions ceasefire violations were recorded in the vicinity of SMM patrols near Kamianka and Pavlopil, forcing them to re-position (see SMM Daily Reports of 25 March and 26 March). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The Mission continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to ena-ble  repairs  to  and  maintenance  and  operation  of  critical  civilian  infrastructure  on  both sides of the contact line, including to complete repairs to a water pipeline near Berezove (providing  water  to  about  10,000  civilians)  and  repairs  to  power  lines  near  Zolote-5/Mykhailivka (benefitting tens of thousands of civilians). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The SMM continued to observe civilians facing challenges when crossing, or attempting to cross, the contact line. It again noted that the only crossing points civilians were able to  use  were  near  Stanytsia  Luhanska  (operational  daily)  and  Novotroitske/Olenivka (twice a week as the armed formations’ checkpoint there is only operational on Mondays and Fridays).  
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The Mission’s freedom of movement on the ground was restricted 18 times, 14 in non-government-controlled areas and four in government-controlled areas (see Spot Reports 4/2021 and 5/2021). SMM unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) were targeted three times by small-arms fire (one mini-UAV was lost as a result) and once by heavy-machine-gun fire, all in non-government-controlled areas. The Mission’s UAVs experienced signal interfer-ence assessed as caused by probable jamming on 63 occasions, including 18 cases when long-range UAVs were targeted, while flying on both sides of the contact line, resulting in the loss of one mini-UAV. </a></p>
