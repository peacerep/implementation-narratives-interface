<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  10  and  23  August,  the  SMM  recorded  440  ceasefire  violations,  including  49 explosions, compared with 256 and 45, respectively, in the previous two weeks. No rec-orded  ceasefire  violations  were  attributable  to  the  use  of  weapons  that  should  have been withdrawn in accordance with the Minsk agreements.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  Over the last two weeks, the Mission neither confirmed nor received any reports about civilian casualties or damage to civilian properties due to shelling or small-arms fire. The total number of civilian casualties since the beginning of 2020 is 61 – eight fatalities and 53 injuries. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The SMM continued monitoring the security situation in and around the three pilot dis-engagement areas, noting continuously the presence of people within or close to former military and military-type positions inside the ones near Zolote and Petrivske. It record-ed one ceasefire violation inside Petrivske disengagement area. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The SMM continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to ena-ble  repairs  and  maintenance  of  critical  civilian  infrastructure.  This  included  repairs  to water  infrastructure  near  Pivdenne  and  Kleban  Byk  as  well  as  near  Pankivka,  Olenivka and Yashchykove, altogether providing water to over 3.4 million people on both sides of the contact line. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMM continued to observe the presence of mines on both sides of the contact line, including 12  probable anti-tank  mines in a field near the Petrovskyi district of Donetsk city and 62 in and near Pisky.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the SMM continued to note reduced numbers of civilians crossing the contact line at Stanytsia Luhanska bridge and observed that some civilians continued  to  stay  overnight  near  the  entry-exit  checkpoint  (EECP)  there.  In  Donetsk region,  where  EECPs  are  mostly  open,  corresponding  checkpoints  of  the  armed  for-mations  –  except  one,  which  operated  only  two  days  a  week  –  remained  closed,  re-sulting in severely restricted movement and hardship for the civilian population.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The  Mission’s  freedom  of  movement  was  restricted  nine  times  on  the  ground,  all  but once in non-government-controlled areas. SMM unmanned aerial vehicles experienced signal interference assessed as caused by probable jamming on 33 occasions while flying near  the  contact  line  in  government-  and  non-government-controlled  areas,  including twice over the disengagement area near Petrivske.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">  Contact line crossing difficulties continue to hinder the operations of the SMM in areas not controlled by the Government. </a></p>
