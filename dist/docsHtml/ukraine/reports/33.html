<p><a id="0" name="0">  Starting  from  15  August,  the  SMM  observed  an  increase  in  the  level  of  violence,  in     

particular  in  the  Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-Donetsk  airport  triangle  and  around  Stanytsia 
Luhanska. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The level of violence remains high in other hotspots of Donetsk region: the western and 

northern  outskirts  of  Horlivka,  areas  around  Shyrokyne  and  Pikuzy  (formerly               
Kominternove),  along  the  Svitlodarsk-Debaltseve  road,  as  well  as  around  Shchastia,   
Lobacheve and in western parts of Luhansk region.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMM continued to observe numerous weapons missing from storage sites as well as 
the presence of weapons in violation of withdrawal lines, often in and around residential 
areas. Consequently, civilians and civilian infrastructure – including homes and utilities – 
are inadvertently caught in the crossfire.

<p><a id="5" name="5">  SMM  monitors  continue  to  be  confronted  by  freedom-of-movement  restrictions,       

particularly  in  areas  not  controlled  by  the  Government.  On  20  August  the  SMM  came 
under small-arms fire in Novooleksandrivka (www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/260541). This 
incident was followed on 22 August by the SMM being held at gunpoint at a checkpoint 
in  Lukove
