<p><a id="0" name="0">  Following  a  40%  reduction  in  the  level  of  violence  from  15  to 21  May,  the  SMM  observed  a  worsening  of  the  security  situation with a 45% increase in ceasefire violations recorded over the period from 22 to 28 May.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  SMM  monitors  continue  to  face  threats  while  implementing their  duties.  For  example,  on  17  May,  a  smoke-generating  device was thrown from a military-type truck close to an SMM vehicle near      so-called  “DPR”-controlled  Dokuchaievsk.  No  SMM  personnel  were injured  or  assets  damaged.  See:  www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/317891

<p><a id="2" name="2">  Civilians  continue  to  suffer  as  armed  men,  soldiers  and  military  hardware are regularly observed in residential areas and in proximity to  civilian  infrastructure.  Even  with  decreased  violence  levels  from 15  to  21  May,  the  SMM  confirmed  six  civilian  casualties,  one  of whom  was  killed.  On  22-28  May,  the  SMM  confirmed  nine  civilian casualties,  all  injured  by  shelling.  This  raises  the  civilian  casualty    figures  confirmed  by  the  SMM  to  233,  including  44  fatalities  since the beginning of 2017.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  On 28-31 May, the SMM hosted 27 Ambassadors to the OSCE. They visited Ukraine to reaffirm their support to resolving the crisis in and around  the  country,  and  travelled  to  Kyiv,  Kramatorsk  and  Kharkiv where they voiced support for the SMM and assessed the effects of the  conflict  on  the  ground  and  its  impact  on  the  humanitarian       situation.</a></p>
