<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  SMM  continued  monitoring  the  security  situation  in  and  around  the  three  disen-
gagement areas. Inside the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska and Zolote, it 
observed  a  calm  situation.  It  recorded  ceasefire  violations  and  saw  persons  in  camou-
flage  clothing  inside  the  Petrivske  disengagement  area.  In  the  second  week  of  the  re-
porting period, members of the armed formations hindered the Mission’s monitoring of 
the Petrivske disengagement area, restricting access to Petrivske and the nearby SMM 
camera site on six consecutive days. SMM unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) experienced 
GPS signal interference in the same vicinity.

ern areas of Hnutove, and 365 in areas  north and south-east of  Pikuzy. The UAVs also 
spotted  130  anti-tank  mines  placed  near  and  across  the  road  between  Talakivka  and

explosive devices and mines, including one fatality – a 35-year old man who died when a 
grenade he had reportedly found while collecting scrap metal exploded in Shevchenko

waiting to cross the contact line, bringing the number of such cases since the beginning 
of the year to four. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The  Mission’s  freedom  of  movement  was  restricted  56  times,  all  in  non-government-

controlled areas.  

</a></p>
