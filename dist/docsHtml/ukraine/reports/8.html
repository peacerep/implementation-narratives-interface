<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 8 and 21 February 2021, the SMM recorded 2,048 ceasefire violations, compared with 1,697 in the previous two-week period. For the 17th consecutive week, the SMM recorded no ceasefire violations attributable to the use of weap-ons that should have been withdrawn in accordance with the Minsk agreements.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  SMM  continued  to  monitor  the  disengagement  areas  near  Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote and Petrivske, observing people in the latter two areas during daytime. On 16 February, an undetermined explosion occurred 300-400m from an SMM patrol close to the disengagement area near Petrivske.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  Mission  continued  to  facilitate  and  monitor  adherence  to  localized  cease-fires to enable repairs to and maintenance and operation of critical civilian infra-structure on both sides of the contact line, including repairs to water infrastruc-ture between Maiorsk  and Horlivka (providing water to about  120 people) and repairs of power lines in Vesela Hora and Obozne (providing electricity to more than 1,400 people). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The  SMM  continued  to  observe  civilians  facing  challenges  when  crossing,  or attempting to cross, the contact line in both directions. It  again noted that the only  crossing  points  civilians  were  able  to  use  continued  to  be  near  Stanytsia Luhanska  (operational  daily)  and  Novotroitske/Olenivka  (twice  a  week  as  the armed  formations’  checkpoint  there  is  only  operational  on  Mondays  and  Fri-days).  
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The Mission’s freedom of movement on the ground was restricted 19 times, all in  non-government-controlled  areas.  SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  were  tar-geted once by small-arms fire, in a non-government-controlled area; and experi-enced signal interference assessed as caused by probable jamming on 23 occa-sions while flying on both sides of the contact line.</a></p>
