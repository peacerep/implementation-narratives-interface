</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1"> Among the dead were a man and a woman killed on 18 October in what appears to have been a  mine  explosion  between  the  positions  of  the  Ukrainian  Armed  Forces  and  the  armed         formations  near  Zolote.  The  SMM  deployed  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAV)  to  identify  the location of the bodies, and facilitated their recovery.

<p><a id="2" name="2"> The SMM recorded almost 18,000 ceasefire violations (just slightly fewer than in the previous two-week period), and observed 106 weapons in violation of the agreed withdrawal lines (62 in areas not controlled by the Government). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3"> With SMM facilitation and regular SMM ‘mirror patrols’ monitoring localized adherence to the ceasefire, repairs to the South Donbas Water Pipeline were completed on 16 October. Dam-aged  in  shelling  on  31  January  2017  –  with  an  estimated  2  million  litres  of  water  being  lost every hour – over 1.2 million people on both sides of the contact line are dependent on it for clean drinking water. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4"> In  the  reporting  period,  the  Mission  continued  to  experience  various  forms  of  restrictions affecting  its  monitoring,  including  77  active  restrictions  on  its  monitoring  officers  on  the ground, 54 in areas not controlled by the Government, routinely so in areas close to the border with  the  Russian  Federation;  three  instances  in  which  small-arms  fire  was  registered  in  the vicinity of monitoring officers, assessed as aimed at SMM UAVs, resulting in the UAVs having to be recalled; 25 instances in which SMM UAVs experienced signal interference affecting their ability to operate to varying degrees; and, the loss of one long-range UAV, which had just prior to its loss spotted a surface-to-air missile system and had experienced signal interference.
