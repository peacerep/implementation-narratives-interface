<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 5 and 18 October, the SMM recorded 215 ceasefire violations, compared with 
429 in the previous two-week period.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  recent  reduction  in  violence,  following  the  Trilateral  Contact  Group’s  adoption  of 
additional measures to strengthen the ceasefire on 22 July, shows once again that with 
political will, concrete results can be achieved on the ground, said Yaşar Halit Çevik, Chief 
Monitor of the SMM, in his address to the OSCE Permanent Council on 8 October. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  Mission  continued  monitoring  the  security  situation  in  and  around  the  three  pilot 
disengagement areas, recording no ceasefire violations, but noting the regular presence 
of people within, or close to, former military and military-type positions inside the areas 
near Zolote and Petrivske.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  SMM  corroborated  reports  of  eight  civilian  casualties  –  including  one  fatality  –  all 
resulting from the detonation of explosive devices. This brings the total number of civil-
ian  casualties  since  the  beginning  of  2020  to  87:  14  fatalities  and  73  injuries.  For  the 
twelfth  consecutive  week,  the  Mission  received  no  reports  of  civilian  casualties  due  to 
shelling or small-arms fire. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The Mission continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to ena-
ble repairs to and maintenance of critical civilian infrastructure on both sides of the con-
tact line. This included repairs to water infrastructure near Pankivka and Krasnyi Lyman 
providing water to around 250,000 civilians, and inspection of power lines near Zolote-4/
Rodina  and  between  Travneve  and  Hladosove,  providing  electricity  to  several  thousand 
civilians. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the SMM continued to note reduced numbers of civilians 
crossing  the  contact  line  at  Stanytsia  Luhanska  bridge  and  observed  that  some  civilians 
continued to stay overnight near the entry-exit checkpoint (EECP). From 15 October on-
wards, the Mission noted that the EECP was closed, with crossing allowed only in excep-
tional circumstances.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6"> In Donetsk region, where EECPs remain operational, the only corresponding checkpoint 
of the armed formations that is operational is the one near Olenivka and it is open only 
two days a week, resulting in severely restricted movement and hardship for the civilian 
population.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">  The Mission’s freedom of movement was restricted seven times on the ground, all in non
-government-controlled areas. SMM unmanned  aerial vehicles experienced signal inter-
ference  assessed  as  caused  by  probable  jamming  on  10  occasions  while  flying  on  both 
sides of the contact line, including twice over the disengagement area near Petrivske. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">  Crossing difficulties at the contact line continue to hinder the SMM’s monitoring of non-

government-controlled areas.
