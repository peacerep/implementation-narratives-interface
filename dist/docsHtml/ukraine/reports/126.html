<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 11 and 24 January 2021, the Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) record-
ed 966 ceasefire violations, compared with 986 in the previous two-week period. 
On 23 January, the Mission noted a peak of ceasefire violations  – 358 – mostly 
near the disengagement area near Petrivske – the highest number recorded on a 
single day since the additional measures took effect on 27 July 2020.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  SMM  continued  to  monitor  the  disengagement  areas  near  Stanytsia 
Luhanska, Zolote and Petrivske, and observed people in the latter two areas dur-
ing  the  daytime.  While  outside  the  area  near  Zolote,  the  Mission  heard  small-
arms fire, assessed as targeting an SMM unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

<p><a id="2" name="2">  During the two-week reporting period, the SMM corroborated two civilian casu-
alties – the case of a  woman killed by the detonation of an explosive device in 
September 2020 in Makiivka, Donetsk region and a man injured due to an explo-
sion of an unknown object near Brianka,  Luhansk region in May 2020.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  Mission  continued  to  facilitate  and  monitor  adherence  to  localized  cease-
fires to enable repairs to and maintenance and operation of critical civilian infra-
structure,  including  to  water  infrastructure  near  Pivdenne  and  Slovianoserbsk, 
providing water to around 150,000 civilians on both sides of the contact line. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The Mission continued seeing anti-tank mines on both sides of the contact line, 
some  for  the  first  time,  including  15  mines,  part  of  a  larger  minefield,  in  areas 
near  Krasnohorivka,  and  eight  mines  laid  across  a  road  on  the  outskirts  of  Do-
netsk city’s Petrovskyi district. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The  SMM  continued  to  observe  civilians  facing  challenges  when  crossing,  or 
attempting to cross, the contact line in both directions. It  again noted that the 
only  crossing  points  civilians  were  able  to  use  continued  to  be  Stanytsia 
Luhanska  (operational  daily)  and  Novotroitske/Olenivka  (checkpoint  of  the 
armed formations near Olenivka, operational only on Monday and Friday).  

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The Mission’s freedom of movement on the ground was restricted 14 times, all 
in  non-government-controlled  areas.  SMM  UAVs  were  targeted  five  times  by 
small-arms  fire  in  non-government-controlled  areas  and  twice  in  government-
controlled  areas  and  experienced  signal  interference  assessed  as  caused  by 
probable jamming on 23 occasions while flying on both sides of the contact line.  </a></p>
