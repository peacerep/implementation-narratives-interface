<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  9  and  22  March,  the  SMM  recorded  about  11,300  ceasefire  violations, 
including about 5,350 explosions. This compares with  about  9,100 and 3,150, re-
spectively, in the previous two-week period. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  Mission continued monitoring the security situation in and around the three 
disengagement  areas.  The  SMM  observed  a  calm  situation  inside  the  disengage-
ment area near Stanytsia Luhanska. It recorded ceasefire violations inside the dis-
engagement area near Petrivske, and it observed mines and unexploded ordnance 
inside the disengagement area near Zolote.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  Over  the  two-week  period,  the  SMM  recorded  85  weapons  in  violation  of  their 
respective  withdrawal  lines,  compared  with  92  in  the  previous  two-week  period: 
34 in government-controlled areas and 51 in non-government-controlled areas.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  SMM unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) spotted anti-tank mines on both sides of the 
contact  line,  including  about  640  near  Sanzharivka  and  Polove,  and  400  near 
Pyshchevyk. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The  Mission  confirmed  four  civilian  casualties:  one  fatality  and  three  injuries, 
bringing  the  total  since  the  beginning  of  the  year  to  25  (three  killed  and  22  in-
jured). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The  Mission  continued  to  monitor  preventive  measures  related  to  the  COVID-19 
outbreak  at  entry-exit  checkpoints  (EECP),  observing  staff  wearing  protective 
masks and gloves, and measuring the temperature of civilians passing through. It 
also  noted  members  of  the  armed  formations  wearing  protective  glasses  and 
masks,  and  screening  pedestrians  transiting  through  a  number  of  corresponding 
checkpoints. Initially the SMM observed long queues at EECPs and corresponding 
checkpoints.  Towards  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  the  SMM  noted  that  pas-
sage for civilians across the contact line in both directions was largely denied. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  During the reporting period, the Missionâ€™s freedom of movement was restricted 68 
times.  Sixty-five  instances  occurred  in  areas  not  controlled  by  the  Government, 
mostly in southern Donetsk region and at border crossing points in Luhansk region. 
A number of restrictions occurred at the contact line, along official crossing routes 
(see  Spot  Report  2/2020).  SMM  UAVs  were  subjected  to  signal  interference  on 
both sides of the contact line on 30 occasions, resulting in the loss of a mid-range 
UAV inside the Petrivske disengagement area. SMM UAVs were targeted by small-
arms  fire  six  times  (twice  in  government-controlled  areas  and  four  times  in  non-
government-controlled areas).
