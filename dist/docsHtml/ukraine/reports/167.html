<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  23  March  and  5  April,  the  SMM  recorded  about  8,700  ceasefire  viola-
tions, including about 2,700 explosions. This constitutes a 23% and 50% reduction, 
respectively, on the previous two-week period. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  Mission continued monitoring the security situation in and around the three 
disengagement  areas.  The  SMM  observed  a  calm  situation  inside  the  disengage-
ment areas near Stanytsia Luhanska and Zolote. It again recorded ceasefire viola-
tions inside the disengagement area near Petrivske.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  SMM  recorded  25  weapons  in  violation  of  their  respective  withdrawal  lines, 
compared with 89 in the previous two-week period: 10 in government-controlled 
areas and 15 in non-government-controlled areas.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  Mission  confirmed  three  civilian  casualties  (one  fatality  and  two  injuries), 
bringing the total since the beginning of the year to 28 (four killed and 24 injured).  
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMM continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to 
enable repairs to and maintenance of critical civilian infrastructure on both sides of 
the  contact  line.  The  Mission  also  facilitated  activities  related  to  demining  near 
Krasnyi  Lyman  and  Vyskryva,  as  well  as  at  two  cemeteries  in  Katerynivka  and 
Zolote-4/Rodina ahead of Easter.  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5"> In  light  of  the  COVID-19  outbreak,  the  SMM  noted  that  entry-exit  checkpoints 
(EECP)  and  corresponding  checkpoints  of  the  armed  formations  remained  closed 
to civilian traffic. The Mission  observed civilians attempting to travel through the 
contact line in both directions. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  Members of the armed formations continued to deny the SMM passage at check-
points  along  official  crossing  routes  in  Donetsk  and  Luhansk  regions.  Overall,  the 
Missionâ€™s  freedom  of  movement  on  the  ground  was  restricted  39  times  (all  but 
one  in  areas  not  controlled  by  the  Government).  SMM  UAVs  were  subjected  to 
signal  interference  on  both  sides  of  the  contact  line  on  15  occasions,  and  were 
targeted  by  small-arms  fire  seven  times  (four  in  government-controlled  areas, 
three in non-government-controlled areas).
