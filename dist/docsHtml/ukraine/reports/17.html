<p><a id="0" name="0">  The security situation in eastern Ukraine continued to be volatile and tense. Although the SMM  recorded  a  relative  decrease  in  the  number  of  ceasefire  violations  over  the  two week period, the level of violence remained high. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  vast  majority  of  ceasefire  violations  occurred  in  areas  south-east  and  east  of           Svitlodarsk,  areas  east  and  north-east  of  Mariupol,  the  Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-Donetsk   airport  triangle,  the  western  and  northern  outskirts  of  Horlivka  and  in  western  Luhansk region. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  SMM  continued  to  observe  weapons  missing  from  storage  sites  as  well  as  the        presence and use of proscribed weapons in violation of withdrawal lines. In the week from 13 to 19 March the use of mortars, tanks and artillery, including MLRS, - all proscribed by the  Minsk  agreements  –  increased  by  75  per  cent  compared  with  the  previous  week.  In particular, the use of artillery recorded during this period increased more than fourfold. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  disengagement  process  remained  stalled.  The  SMM’s  access  to  three  agreed          disengagement areas remained restricted due to mines and unexploded ordnance, though the SMM was able to partially monitor them, including through remote observation. The SMM observed ceasefire violations inside all three disengagement  areas. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  During  the  last  two  weeks  two  incidents  involving  small-arms  fire  and  mortar  rounds   explosions  near  SMM  members  and  vehicles  were  registered  in  areas  not  controlled  by the  Government.
