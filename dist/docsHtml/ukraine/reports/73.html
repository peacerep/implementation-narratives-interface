<p><a id="0" name="0"> Between 26 November and 9 December, the SMM confirmed that two civilians were injured. 
This brings the total number of civilian casualties since 1 January 2018 to 222 (43 deaths and 
179 injuries).

<p><a id="1" name="1"> The SMM recorded over 20,000 ceasefire violations (as compared with over 11,900 in the 
previous two-week period) and 160 weapons in violation of the agreed withdrawal lines (135 in 
areas not controlled by the Government).

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> The Mission deployed 136 patrols, facilitating and monitoring 48 localized “windows of silence” 
to allow for the repair and maintenance of 11 civilian infrastructure facilities. This included 
maintenance work at the Petrivske Pumping Station, providing potable water to approximately 
150,000 civilians in non-government-controlled areas of Luhansk region, and repairs to the 
Krasnohorivka Gas Distribution Station, providing gas to some 20,000 people in the governmentcontrolled towns of Marinka and Krasnohorivka in Donetsk region.

<p><a id="3" name="3"> In a thematic report released by the Mission on 6 December (SMM facilitation and monitoring 
of infrastructure repair in eastern Ukraine: January 2017-August 2018, www.osce.org/specialmonitoring-mission-to-ukraine/405473), SMM efforts at minimizing some effects of the conflict 
on the civilian population were outlined. In particular, the report noted that 3,400 patrols had 
been mounted in the period, allowing for repairs and maintenance to over 150 facilities, 
supporting over 4 million beneficiaries dependent on water, electricity, gas and 
telecommunications.

<p><a id="4" name="4"> Following the incident at sea near the Kerch Strait, the Mission received information that 
operations at Mariupol Commercial Sea Port have been adversely affected, with restricted 
access through the Strait. This led to reduced cargo volume, compared with April 2018, and 
financial loss. The Mission noted that a calm situation generally prevailed in governmentcontrolled areas where martial law had been declared immediately after the incident at sea.
