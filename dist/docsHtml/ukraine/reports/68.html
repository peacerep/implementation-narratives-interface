along official crossing routes in Donetsk and Luhansk regions (see Spot Report 25/2020 
and Spot Report 27/2020). Overall, the Missionâ€™s freedom of movement on the ground 
was restricted 55 times (52 in areas not controlled by the Government, twice in govern-

tact line on 19 occasions, and were targeted by small-arms fire three times (all in non-
government-controlled areas).
