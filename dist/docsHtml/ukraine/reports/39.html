<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  3  and  16  June,  the  SMM  confirmed  that  one  civilian  was  killed  and  16  were 
injured.  This  brings  the  total  number  of  civilian  casualties  since  1  January  2019  to  57 
(seven deaths and 50 injuries). In one incident in the reporting period, five members of a 
family,  including  a  nine-year-old  girl,  were  injured  when  their  home  in  Marinka  was 
shelled; the house has been hit by shelling five times since the beginning of the conflict. 
The SMM observed  damage caused by  small-arms fire and shelling to civilian  property 
and  infrastructure  in  numerous  other  locations  along  the  contact  line,  including  to  a 
functioning  school  in  Zolote  (which  has  sustained  damage  11  times  since  December 
2018) and to two houses in Chermalyk.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  SMM  recorded  over  14,700  ceasefire  violations  (compared  with  almost  10,650  in 

the previous two-week period). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  Mission  observed  44  weapons  in  violation  of  the  agreed  withdrawal  lines  (32  in 
areas  not  controlled  by  the  Government).  It  also  noted  the  presence  of  weapons  and 
other hardware  in residential areas, which puts civilians and their property at  risk.  For 
instance,  SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAV)  spotted  surface-to-air  missile  systems 
close to houses in Chernenko and close to a functioning school in Tarasivka; and infantry 
fighting vehicles in residential areas of Bezimenne and Luhansk city.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  Mission  continued  to  see  mines,  some  for  the  first  time,  despite  prohibitions  in 
place. SMM UAVs spotted for the first time anti-tank mines near Staromykhailivka (280), 
Lozove (98), Prychepylivka (300), Krasnohorivka (about 1,900), Travneve (30) and Pisky 
(90).  

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMMâ€™s freedom of movement continued to be restricted, with 32 active restrictions 
recorded  (all  but  three  in  areas  not  controlled  by  the  Government).  In  addition,  SMM 
UAVs continued to experience signal interference on an almost daily basis on both sides 
of the contact line. The Mission noted the presence of two electronic warfare systems 
and a surveillance radar system in areas not controlled by the Government. Small-arms 
fire  was  twice  directed  at  SMM  UAVs.  On  one  occasion  during  the  reporting  period, 
shots were fired over the heads of SMM monitoring officers near Molodizhne.
