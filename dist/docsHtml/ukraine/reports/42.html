<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 22 January and 4 February, the security situation in eastern Ukraine remained tense 
and volatile. During the two-week reporting period, the SMM recorded around 11,000 ceasefire 
violations in total – a  15 per cent  decrease compared to the previous two  weeks. There was, 
however, an uptick in armed violence in the latter half of this period, with 25 per cent increase 
in ceasefire violations compared to the previous week.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  vast  majority  of  violations  were  concentrated  in  five  hotspots:  the  Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-
Donetsk  airport  area,  the  areas  located  south-west,  south  and  south-east  of  Svitlodarsk,  the 
Popasna-Pervomaisk  area, the eastern and north-eastern  sector of  Mariupol and the western 
and south-western outskirts of Horlivka.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  Between 22 January and 4 February, the SMM confirmed eight civilian casualties, which brings 

the total number since the beginning of 2018 to 14 persons: four killed and ten injured.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The SMM faced 24 restrictions to its freedom of movement: 3 times in government-controlled 
areas and 21 times in areas outside government control. On 2 and 3 February, while conducting 
mini-UAV  flights  in  government-controlled  areas  the  SMM  heard  small-arms  fire  assessed  as 
directed towards its unmanned aerial vehicles

<p><a id="4" name="4">  On 2 February, an SMM patrol in a non-government-controlled area near Yasynuvata heard the 
hissing sound of three bullets flying west  to east over their heads and saw one of the bullets 
land  10-15m  east  of location.  Read  more

<p><a id="5" name="5">  Between  22  January  and  4  February,  the  Mission  facilitated  and  monitored  11  “windows  of 
silence”  –  localized  adherence  to  the  ceasefire  –  which  allowed  for  repairs  and  maintenance 
work  on  two  critical  infrastructure  facilities  on  both  sides  of  the  contact  line.  They  include 
water  wells  near  non-government-controlled  Krasnyi  Lyman  and  at  the  Petrivske  pumping 
station near government-controlled Artema.
