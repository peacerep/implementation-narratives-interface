<p><a id="0" name="0"> Between 20 August and 2 September, the SMM recorded fewer ceasefire 
violations (around 8,000), compared with the previous two weeks. The SMM 
noted a decrease in the number of ceasefire violations following the 
recommitment to the ceasefire on the occasion of the beginning of the school 
year, which began at 00:01hrs on 29 August. Until 2 September, however, it 
registered around 600 ceasefire violations.

<p><a id="1" name="1"> The SMM continued to observe weapons in violation of the agreed withdrawal 
lines (43 over the two-week period). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> The SMM followed up on an explosion in the Donetsk city centre on the 
afternoon of 31 August. Two people were reported dead, including a senior 
member of the armed formations, and at least nine other people were injured. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3"> In addition to the ongoing threats posed by the presence of mines and 
unexploded ordnance – which the sides have undertaken to remove – the 
Mission continued to encounter restrictions of its freedom of movement. This 
was particularly the case at checkpoints in non-government-controlled areas of 
the southern Donetsk region and in areas near the border with the Russian 
Federation outside government control.

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4"> The SMM followed up on temporary closures of entry-exit checkpoints, including 
near Maiorsk (due to armed violence in the area), Stanytsia Luhanska (due to 
construction work), as well as near Novotroitske and a checkpoint near Berezove 
(due to a wildfire in the area).

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5"> Civilians, particularly those living close to the contact line, continued to face 
hardship as a result of ongoing hostilities. Between 1 January 2018 and 
2 September 2018 the SMM corroborated 179 civilian casualties (34 killed and 
145 injured).
