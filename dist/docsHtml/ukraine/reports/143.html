<p><a id="0" name="0"> From 13 to 26 November the securiy situation in eastern Ukraine deteriorated. The SMM 
registered over 14,500 ceasefire violations in total, which is a 20 per cent increase on the 
previous reporting period. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1"> Factors contributing to the armed violence – the failure of the sides to withdraw weapons, 
disengage forces and formations, and de-mine – continue. The Mission continued to 
observe heavy weapons in violation of withdrawal lines: 18 in government-controlled areas 
and 99 in areas outside of government control. Mines and unexploded ordnance remained 
in place in many areas, in particular in and around entry-exit checkpoints. On 19 November
the SMM noted for the first time three anti-tank mines about 30m north of the road 
between Pyshchevyk and “DPR”-controlled Verkhnoshyrokivske, less than 2km east of 
Pyshchevyk. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> The disengagement process remained stalled, in all three agreed areas. The Mission 
followed up on reports that the Ukrainian Armed Forces had moved into the village of 
Travneve, close to the contact line. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3"> The SMM’s freedom of movement remained restricted due to the presence of mines and 
unexploded ordnance on both sides of the contact line, as well as denial of access by 
soldiers or armed persons. Most of restrictions occurred in non-government-controlled 
areas. The Mission continued to facilitate and monitor repairs and maintenance to essential 
civilian infrastructure. From 13 to 26 November the Mission monitored and facilitated 46 
‘windows of silence’ allowing for inspection, repair and maintenance work to 16 
infrastructure facilities on both sides of the contact line, including to the phenol sludge 
reservoir near Zalizne. An additional two ‘windows of silence’ were conducted in Luhansk 
region to enable the transport of the remains of deceased soldiers near Novotoshkivske and 
Sentianivka, and the subsequent transfer of their remains over the Shchastia bridge to 
government-controlled areas. To mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence 
against Women, the SMM Chief Monitor and OSCE Project Co-ordinator issued a statement 
calling for the protection and inclusion of women in Ukraine. Read more:
