<p><a id="0" name="0">  From 25 December 2017 to 7 January 2018, the OSCE SMM recorded over 5,800 ceasefire 
violations.  Overall,  this  constituted  an  almost  80  per  cent  decrease  compared  to  the 
previous  two-week  reporting  period,  following  the  recommitment  to  the  ceasefire  on 
23 December 2017.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  As  with  previous  recommitments  to  the  ceasefire,  the  Mission  has  already  noted 
deterioration,  with  the  first  week  of  2018  seeing  a  significant  increase  in  the  number  of 
ceasefire violations compared to the previous week.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  Ceasefire  violations  were  mostly  observed  around  Svitlodarsk,  in  the  Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-Donetsk airport area and in areas east and north-east of Mariupol. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3"> In the last days of December 2017 three civilians were injured, which brings the 2017 total 
for civilian casualties to 476, including 86 fatalities. From 1 to 7 January 2018, the SMM did 
not record any casualties. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  On  27  December  2017,  the  SMM  monitored,  with  mirror  patrols  on  both  sides  of  the 
contact  line,  and  facilitated  on  the  spot  an  exchange  of  detainees  at  the  entry-exit 
checkpoint  in  government-controlled  Maiorsk  (45km  north-east  of  Donetsk)  and  at  a 
checkpoint  in non-government  controlled Horlivka (39km north-east of Donetsk). This  was 
the first exchange of detainees since September 2016. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  From  25  December  2017  to  7  January  2018,  the  Mission  monitored  and  facilitated  three 
“windows of silence” – localized adherence to the ceasefire – which allowed for inspection, 
repair and maintenance work on three critical civilian infrastructure facilities on both sides 
of  the  contact  line.  On  29  December  2017,  the  SMM  facilitated  and  monitored  repairs  to 
power lines near Betmanove. It was informed that power had been restored to the village. It 
also facilitated and monitored maintenance works in Zalizne.
