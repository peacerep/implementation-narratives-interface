<p><a id="0" name="0">  For the sixteenth consecutive week, despite higher numbers of recorded cease-
fire  violations,  the  security  situation  remained  relatively  calm  following  addi-
tional measures to strengthen the ceasefire, which  took  effect on 27 July. Be-
tween  2  and  15  November,  the  SMM  recorded  469  ceasefire  violations,  com-
pared with 238 in the previous two-week period.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  Mission  continued  monitoring  the  security  situation  in  and  around  the 
three pilot disengagement areas, recording no ceasefire violations inside any of 
them. Inside the areas near Petrivske and Zolote, SMM unmanned aerial vehi-
cles (UAV) spotted previously-seen anti-tank mines and again people near and 
inside former military and military-type positions. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The SMM corroborated reports of 11 civilian casualties, nine of which had oc-
curred  prior  to  the  additional  measures  that  took  effect  on  27  July,  including 
two fatalities. This brings the total number of civilian casualties since the begin-
ning of 2020 to 103: 18 fatalities and 85 injuries.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The Mission continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized cease-
fires to enable repairs to and maintenance and operation of critical civilian in-
frastructure, including the Donetsk  Filtration Station,  which provides water to 
around 380,000 civilians on both sides of the contact line.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  Civilian movement across the contact line continued to be restricted. The Mis-
sion again noted that the only points where civilians were able to cross contin-
ued to be Stanytsia Luhanska and Novotroitske/Olenivka. In each location, lim-
ited numbers of civilians were observed travelling in both directions. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The Missionâ€™s freedom of movement was restricted eight times on the ground, 
all in non-government-controlled areas. SMM UAVs experienced signal interfer-
ence assessed as caused by probable jamming on 15 occasions while flying on 
both sides of the contact line.
