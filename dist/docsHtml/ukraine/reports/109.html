<p><a id="3" name="3"> The SMM is ready to monitor and verify the process of the withdrawal of heavy weaponry in eastern Ukraine. In order to verify the withdrawal – to testify that specific weapons really have been and remain withdrawn – the SMM needs to know what heavy weapons the sides have, where these weapons are now, and where they will be located after they have been withdrawn. The Chief Monitor sent a request for this information to the signatories of the Minsk agreements, but so far their responses have not been received.
