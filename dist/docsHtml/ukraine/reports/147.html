<p><a id="0" name="0">  22  July  marked  the  first  anniversary  of  agreement  on  the  measures  to  strengthen the ceasefire. The measures contributed to the longest  lasting and most  sustained decrease  in  recorded  ceasefire  violations  since  the  Mission  started  systematically collecting  data  —  by  almost  80  per  cent  (240,985  ceasefire  violations  between  27 July 2019 and 26 July 2020 compared to 47,029 ceasefire violations during the same period  from  2020  to  2021).  Over  the  last  four  months,  however,  the  ceasefire  has been fraying both in terms of quantity and quality of violations. In  the  last  two  weeks  (12-25  July),  the  SMM  noted  a  decrease  in  the  number  of ceasefire  violations  —  3,600,  compared  with  3,975  recorded  in  the  previous  two-week period.

<p><a id="1" name="1"> The  Mission  continued  to  monitor  the  disengagement  areas  near  Stanytsia Luhanska,  Zolote  and  Petrivske,  again  recording  ceasefire  violations  inside  the  last two areas. In total, since 27 July 2020, the SMM registered zero ceasefire violations inside the area near Stanytsia Luhanska, nine — inside the area near Zolote, and 531 inside the Petrivske disengagement area. In comparison, between 27 July 2019 and 26 July 2020, there were 13 ceasefire violations registered inside the area near Stan-ytsia  Luhanska;  195  inside  the  area  near  Zolote,  and  2,292  inside  Petrivske  disen-gagement area. In  the  last  two  weeks,  the  SMM  corroborated  reports  of  two  civilians  injured  by shrapnel, one in Donetsk region and the other in Luhansk region. Overall, since 27 July 2020, the Mission confirmed 87 civilian casualties, including 69 caused by mines, unexploded ordnance, and improvised explosive devices (133 and 49, respectively, were confirmed between 27 July 2019 and 26 July 2020).

<p><a id="2" name="2"> The Mission’s freedom of movement was restricted 56 times, including 50 instances in  non-government-controlled  areas.  SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAVs)  were assessed  as  targeted  by  small-arms  fire  five  times:  three  times  in  government-controlled  and  twice  in  non-government-controlled  areas.  Mission  UAVs  experi-enced signal interference assessed as caused by probable jamming on 66 occasions, while flying on both sides of the contact line.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  SMM  continued  to  facilitate  and  monitor  adherence  to  localized  ceasefires  to enable the maintenance and operation of critical civilian infrastructure on both sides of  the  contact  line,  including  maintenance  of  the  phenol  sludge  reservoir  near Zalizne  (formerly  Artemove)  and  repairs  to  water  infrastructure  in  Krasnyi  Lyman (benefitting over 100,000 civilians). </a></p>
