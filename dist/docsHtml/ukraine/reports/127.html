<p><a id="0" name="0">  The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM) reported that violence levels  fluctuated  but  remained  high,  with  hundreds  of  ceasefire  violations     recorded on a daily basis.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  Violence  was  concentrated  around  the  following  hotspots:  areas  east  and   north-east  of  Mariupol;  the  Avdiivka-Yasynuvata-Donetsk  airport  triangle;  the western and northern outskirts of Horlivka; and on the Svitlodarsk-Debaltseve road.  In Luhansk region the situation remained relatively calm. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> SMM  monitors  could  not  verify  that  the  sides  have  disengaged  as  the  sides have failed to provide safe and secure access for the SMM. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  Nevertheless, during the monitoring teamsâ€™ daily attempts to monitor the three disengagement  areas,  the  SMM  noted  some  efforts  towards  disengagement. The  monitors  have  observed  positions  being  dismantled  in  the  Zolote-Pervomaisk area; as well as some armed forces/formations and hardware being moved  out  of  the  Zolote-Pervomaisk  and  Petrivske-Bohdanivka  areas.           Additionally, some demining was also noted.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  At  the  same  time,  the  SMM  continued  to  observe  weapons  missing  from      storage sites as well as the presence and use of proscribed weapons in violation of withdrawal lines. 
</a></p>
