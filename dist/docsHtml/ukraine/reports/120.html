Trilateral Contact Group, Martin Sajdik, and the Chief Monitor of the OSCE SMM, Ertugrul 
Apakan, called for restraint, following incidents at sea near the Kerch Strait that had raised 
tensions  between  Ukraine  and the  Russian  Federation.
(see  www.osce.org/chairmanship/404225).

<p><a id="1" name="1"> Between 12 and 25 November, the SMM confirmed that four civilians were injured. This 
brings  the  total  number  of  civilian  casualties  since  1  January  to  220  (43  deaths  and  177  
injuries).  

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> The  SMM  recorded  over  11,900  ceasefire  violations  (compared  with  over  18,000  in  the  
previous  two-week  period)  and  122  weapons  in  violation  of  the  agreed  withdrawal  lines 
(102 in areas not controlled by the Government).

including  31  recently-laid  mines  near  Vodiane  and  12  mines  near  Pikuzy.  The  Mission  
facilitated  security  guarantees,  enabling  demining  activities  near  Nyzhnoteple  and  the  
clearance  of  UXO  near  Marinka.  On  12  and  13  November,  the  Mission  held  mine-
awareness  outreach  events  in  Stanytsia  Luhanska  and  Shchastia,  respectively,  for  more
