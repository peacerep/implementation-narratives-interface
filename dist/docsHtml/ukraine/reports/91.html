<p><a id="0" name="0">  For the sixth week in a row, after additional measures to strengthen the ceasefire took effect, the level of armed violence continues to remain low. Between 24 August and 6 September, the SMM recorded 254 ceasefire violations.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The SMM continued monitoring the security situation in and around the three pilot dis-engagement areas, recording no ceasefire violations but noting again the regular pres-ence of people within or close to former military and military-type positions inside the ones near Zolote and Petrivske.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  Mission  corroborated  reports  of  three  civilian  casualties  –  including  one  fatality  – resulting from the detonation of explosive objects, bringing the total number since the beginning of 2020 to 64: nine fatalities and 55 injuries. For the sixth consecutive week, the  Mission  received  no  reports  of  civilian  casualties  or  damage  to  civilian  properties due to shelling or small-arms fire. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The SMM continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to ena-ble repairs to and maintenance of critical civilian infrastructure. This included repairs to water  infrastructure  between  Toretsk  and  Horlivka,  providing  water  to  about  150,000 people on both sides of the contact line. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMM continued to observe the presence of mines on both sides of the contact line, some seen for the first time, including 10 anti-tank mines in the outskirts of Donetsk city and 22 near Opytne.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the SMM continued to note reduced numbers of civilians crossing the contact line at Stanytsia Luhanska bridge and observed that some civilians continued  to  stay  overnight  near  the  entry-exit  checkpoint  (EECP)  there.  In  Donetsk region,  where  EECPs  are  mostly  open,  corresponding  checkpoints  of  the  armed  for-mations  –  except  one,  which  operated  only  two  days  a  week  –  remained  closed,  re-sulting in severely restricted movement and hardship for the civilian population. In some cases, people had to stay overnight, without shelter or adequate facilities, as they wait-ed for permission to cross. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The Mission’s freedom of movement was restricted 15 times on the ground, all in non-government-controlled areas. SMM unmanned aerial vehicles experienced signal inter-ference assessed as caused by probable jamming on 20 occasions while flying near the contact  line  in  government-  and  non-government-controlled  areas,  including  three times over the disengagement area near Petrivske.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">  Crossing difficulties at the contact line continue to hinder the operations of the SMM in non-government-controlled areas.</a></p>
