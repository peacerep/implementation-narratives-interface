<p><a id="1" name="1">  OSCE  SMM  monitors  contributed  to  the  improvement  of  the  humanitarian situation  by  facilitating  and  monitoring  localized  adherence  to  the  ceasefire,  co-ordinated  by  the  Joint  Centre  for  Control  and  Co-ordination  in  order  to   allow  for  repair  and  maintenance  works.  From  4  to  17  September,  such “windows of silence” enabled repairs to the thermal power plant in Shchastia, the Petrivske pumping station in Artema, water wells near Stanytsia Luhanska, and  water  pipelines  near  Nyzhnie,  Zolote  and  Popasna  in  Luhansk  region.  In Donetsk region, completion of repairs to the water pipeline between Horlivka and Toretsk doubled the flow of water to 30,000 cubic metres, according to a worker  of  the  Voda  Donbassa  company.  The  Mission  conducted  at  least  52 patrols on both sides of the contact line to support repairs and maintenance in this period.
