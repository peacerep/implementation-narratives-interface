<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 11 and 24  March, the  SMM recorded over 17,700 ceasefire violations (about 
15,700 in the previous two-week period). Almost 10,000 of them were recorded in the 
second part of the reporting period; the highest number since early November 2018.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The Mission observed 139 weapons in violation of the agreed withdrawal lines (116 in 

areas not controlled by the Government). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  A number of areas were of particular concern, namely Chermalyk – which has been the 
scene of repeated spikes in violence since October 2018 following the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces  and  the  armed  formations  moving  closer  to  each  other  in  the  area  –  and  in 
Zolote, where the Mission continued to observe personnel, hardware, mines, ceasefire 
violations  and  damage  to  civilian  property.  On  11  March,  the  SMM  observed  damage 
caused by small-arms fire to a functioning school building in Zolote. The school has sus-
tained damage six times since late December 2018.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The  Mission  continued  to  face  restrictions  on  its  freedom  of  movement  and  other  im-
pediments to fulfilment of its Mandate. In addition to mines and unexploded ordnance, 
members  of  the  armed  formations  restricted  the  SMM’s  freedom  of movement  on  40 
occasions and the Ukrainian Armed Forces five times. The problem remains acute in non
-government-controlled areas of southern Donetsk region. Since June 2018, members of 
the  armed  formations  have  denied  the  SMM  passage  through  checkpoints  near  
Zaichenko over 100 times and near Verkhnoshyrokivske over 60 times.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  Targeting of SMM unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has continued, with the most serious 
incident  occurring  on  20  March,  when  14  bursts  of  heavy  machine-gun  fire  were  di-
rected  at  an  SMM  long-range  UAV  near  non-government-controlled  Dovhe  in  Luhansk 
region. The  SMM  had resumed its long-range UAV flights just four days  previously fol-
lowing  an  assessment  of  an  incident  involving  the  loss  of  a  long-range  UAV  on  18         
February in a non-government-controlled area of Luhansk region.
