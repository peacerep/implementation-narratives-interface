<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 3 and 16 May 2021, the SMM noted an increase in the number of ceasefire viola-

tions – recording 4,848 of them, compared with 3,135 in the previous two-week period.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote 
and Petrivske, recording increased kinetic activity inside or near the latter two areas and 
noting the presence of people inside the latter two areas. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  Over  the  past  two  weeks,  the  SMM  corroborated  eight  civilian  casualties,  including  two 
fatalities. This brings the total number of civilian casualties that occurred since the begin-
ning of 2021 to 24 (nine fatalities and 15 injuries). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The Mission saw damage to 14 private properties and civilian infrastructure sites on both 
sides  of  the  contact  line,  including  to  a  functional  hospital  in  a  government-controlled 
area  of  Donetsk  region  and  a  functional  school  in  a  non-government-controlled  area  of 
Luhansk  region.  Since  the  beginning  of  the  year,  the  Mission  confirmed  damage  to  30 
private properties and civilian infrastructure sites. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  On both sides of the contact line in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, SMM unmanned aerial 
vehicles  (UAVs)  continued  spotting  mines,  including  4,165  anti-tank  mines,  about  100 
probable anti-personnel mines and three pieces of unexploded ordnance.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The  Mission’s  freedom  of  movement  was  restricted  13  times,  all  in  non-government-
controlled areas. SMM UAVs were targeted six times by small-arms fire on both sides of 
the contact line. The Mission’s  UAVs experienced  signal interference assessed as caused 
by  probable  jamming  or  jamming  on  105  occasions,  including  34  instances  when  long-
range UAVs were affected (forcing one emergency landing, see Spot Report 13/2021). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The SMM continued to observe civilians while crossing, or attempting to cross, the contact 
line and their challenges. It again noted that the only crossing points civilians were able to 
use  were  near  Stanytsia  Luhanska  (opened  daily)  and  Novotroitske/Olenivka  (twice  a 
week, as the armed formations’ checkpoint there is only open on Mondays and Fridays).  

</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">  The Mission continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to ena-
ble maintenance and operation of critical civilian infrastructure on both sides of the con-
tact  line,  including  maintenance  of  water  infrastructure  near  Novotoshkivske  and  near 
Holmivskyi, altogether providing water to around 9,000 civilians.
