<p><a id="0" name="0"> After  five  consecutive  weeks  of  decrease levels  of  violence,  the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM)  observed  a  deterioration of  the  security  situation  with  a  75 per cent  increase  in  the  number  of      ceasefire violations recorded from 8 to 14 May. The SMM monitors noted an increased use of weapons proscribed by the Minsk agreements, in particular multiple launch rocket systems. After intensive shelling on 13 and 14 May the SMM  confirmed  multiple  civilian  casualties,  with  five  killed  and  four  injured on both sides of the contact line. A lull in fighting followed on 15 May.

<p><a id="1" name="1"> The SMM’s freedom of movement remains restricted. During the period from 1 to 14 May its access was restricted on 31 occasions: 22 in non-government controlled  areas  and  nine  in  government-controlled  areas.  In  addition,  the Mission’s  patrolling  remains  restricted  to  asphalt  and  concrete  roads,         following the death of one OSCE SMM member and the injury of two others when  their  vehicle  hit  what  was  probably  a  mine  near  Pryshyb  on  23 April. The  restrictions  on  the  implementation  of  the  SMM’s  mandate  are  under  regular review but are likely to remain in place until the sides take measures to remove mines or mark or fence them off.

<p><a id="2" name="2"> The  Chief  Monitor  of  the  SMM,  Ertugrul  Apakan,  addressed the OSCE  Permanent Council in Vienna on 12 May. He emphasized that the safety and  security  of  the  SMM’s  unarmed  civilian  monitors  –  and  of  the  wider     civilian population in eastern Ukraine – must be prioritized by the sides to the conflict.
