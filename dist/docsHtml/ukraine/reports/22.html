<p><a id="0" name="0">  The SMM observed  a serious deterioration in the security situation in the  Avdiivka-
Yasynuvata-Donetsk airport triangle. On 31 January, it recorded the highest number 
of ceasefire violations since the beginning of the crisis in 2014. See:  www.osce.org/
ukraine-smm/296961.  Through  the  active  involvement  of  the  SMM  and  the  Joint 
Centre for Control and Co-ordination (JCCC) on the ground, violence levels dropped 
considerably towards the end of the same week.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The SMM noted the negative impact the upsurge in violence has had on the civilian   
population  and,  in  particular,  on  critical  infrastructure  and  residential  areas,  which 
were increasingly caught up in the violence. The number of casualties among civilians         
inevitably  rose,  with  the  SMM  confirming  25  cases,  including  seven  fatalities,  from 
29 January to 5 February. See: www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/297606.

<p><a id="2" name="2">  In his statements, the SMM Chief Monitor Ambassador Ertugrul Apakan condemned 
the indiscriminate use of violence costing lives of the local population and damage to 
civilian  infrastructure.  He  called  upon  the  sides  to  immediately  cease  fire  and       
withdraw weapons in compliance with the agreements reached in Minsk as well as to 
respect  humanitarian  law  a  protect  civilians  and  infrastructure.  See:  bit.ly/2jSZtmj,

<p><a id="3" name="3">  On 5 February, after five days of negotiations by the SMM and sustained monitoring 
on both sides of the contact line in and around the Donetsk water filtration station, 
repair  crews  repaired  power  lines  damaged  in  shelling.  The  electricity  supply  to    
Avdiivka  and  the  Donetsk  water  filtration  station  was  restored  after  a  week-long 
blackout.

<p><a id="4" name="4">  On  3  February,  in  “LPR”-controlled  Kalynove,  an  armed  man  pointed  a  gun  in  the        

direction of an SMM team. Shortly after, the monitors heard a gunshot and left the 
area. See: www.osce.org/node/297611.
