<p><a id="0" name="0">  With  a  recommitment  to  the  ceasefire  coming  into  effect  on  5  March,  the  Mission  noted  a decrease of 82 per cent in the number of ceasefire violations in the first week of the reporting period  (5-11  March).  The  following  week,  however,  saw  an  increase  in  violence,  with  the number of ceasefire violations doubled compared with the previous week.

<p><a id="1" name="1"> Workers  of  the  Donetsk  Filtration  Station  came  under  small-arms  fire  four  times  during  the reporting  period.  This  is  despite  a  commitment  made  in  July  2017  in  the  Trilateral  Contact Group’s  Working  Group  for  Security  Issues  to  establish  “safety  zones”  around  critical  civilian infrastructure facilities.  In addition to the presence of mines (on both sides of the contact line) and active restrictions imposed (mainly in areas not controlled by the Government), the Mission also faced threats to its monitoring officers and its assets were targeted. On 5 March, a man at a checkpoint in non-government  controlled Kozatske pointed an assault rifle at SMM monitors and threatened to shoot  them  (see  Spot  Report:  www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/374404). On  10  March,  for  the  sixth  consecutive  week,  small-arms  fire  was  directed  at  an  SMM  mini unmanned aerial vehicle flying over a compound controlled by armed formations near Ternove in Donetsk region. In Zakarpattia region, the Mission with overlapping patrols from Ivano-Frankivsk noted a largely calm situation following earlier incidents at the office of the Zakarpattia Hungarian Union. On 18 March, the SMM monitored the security situation at several locations associated with the Russian  Federation  presidential  election.  The  monitors  observed  police  presence  at  these locations and people not being allowed to access some of them by police.
