<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 16 and 29 April 2018, the SMM recorded almost 8,300 ceasefire violations along the 
contact  line  in  the  east  of  Ukraine  –  a  ten  per  cent  decrease  on  the  previous  two-week 
reporting period. There was a notable upsurge in violence on 24 and 25 April, during which 30 
per cent of the total number of recorded ceasefire violations occurred.

<p><a id="1" name="1">  The ongoing violence resulted in a number of civilian casualties, with six people killed and 17 
injured.  This  brings  the  total  number  of  civilian  casualties  confirmed  by  the  SMM  since  the 
beginning of the year to 74, including 18 fatalities. #ZeroCivilianCasualties

<p><a id="2" name="2">  During the reporting period, the SMM’s freedom of movement remained restricted due to the 
presence of mines and unexploded ordnance on both sides of the contact line, as well as due 
to restrictions, mostly denied access, by members of the armed formations (23 times) and by 
the  Ukrainian  Armed  Forces  (five  times).  In  one  incident  on  28  April  at  a  checkpoint  near 
Horlivka,  members  of  the  armed  formations  threatened  to  detain  patrol  members  (see 
www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/379075).  Moreover,  the  sides  continue 
to target SMM unmanned aerial vehicles, jamming them and directing small-arms fire at them.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  Since 18 April, the SMM has been facilitating and monitoring access for Voda Donbassa water 
company employees to and from the Donetsk Filtration Station after employees came under 
small-arms fire and were wounded on 17 April. The Donetsk Filtration Station is an important 
civilian infrastructure facility that supplies water to more than 300,000 people on both sides of 
the contact line.
