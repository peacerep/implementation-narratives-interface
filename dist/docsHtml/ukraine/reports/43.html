<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 17 and 30 May 2021, the SMM noted a decrease in the number of ceasefire vio-
lations – recording 4,045 of them, compared with 4,848 in the previous two-week period. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote 
and Petrivske, and observed people inside the latter two areas. It also recorded 153 cease-
fire  violations  and  saw  recent  impact  craters  near  former  positions  of  the  armed  for-
mations inside the disengagement area near Petrivske. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  Over  the  past  two  weeks,  the  SMM  corroborated  nine  civilian  casualties,  including  two 
fatalities. This brings the total number of civilian casualties since the beginning of 2021 to 
33 (11 fatalities and 22 injuries). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  During a five-day official visit to Ukraine, Secretary General Helga Maria Schmid stressed 
that “the SMM must be able to work safely, securely, and unhindered on both sides of the 
contact line.” She also noted the continuing  impact of landmines on the civilian popula-
tion, as highlighted by the Mission’s latest thematic report. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The  Mission’s  freedom  of  movement  was  restricted  28  times,  27  of  which  in  non-
government-controlled  areas,  including  once  when  members  of  the  armed  formations 
denied the SMM passage at a checkpoint near Olenivka, Donetsk region (see Spot Report 
15/2021).  

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  SMM unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were targeted by small-arms fire, five times in non
-government-controlled  areas  and  once  in  government-controlled  areas.  The  Mission’s 
UAVs  experienced  signal  interference  assessed  as  caused  by  probable  jamming  or  jam-
ming on 133 occasions on both sides of the contact line, including 30 instances when long-
range UAVs were affected (forcing one emergency landing during which the aircraft sus-
tained damage, see the Mission’s Spot Report 14/2021). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The SMM continued to observe civilians crossing, or attempting to cross, the contact line 
and  the  challenges  they  face.  It  again  noted  that  the  only  crossing  points  civilians  were 
able  to  use  were  near  Stanytsia  Luhanska  (open  daily)  and  Novotroitske/Olenivka  (open 
twice a week, as the armed formations’ corresponding checkpoint there is only open on 
Mondays and Fridays).  

</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">  The Mission continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to ena-
ble  maintenance  and  operation  of  critical  civilian  infrastructure,  including  repairs  to  a 
phenol sludge reservoir near Zalizne (formerly Artemove) and to water infrastructure near 
Horlivka, benefitting over 250,000 civilians on both sides of the contact line. On 20 May, 
despite security guarantees, an undetermined explosion occurred close to an SMM patrol 
near Avdiivka while it was facilitating the operation of the Donetsk Filtration Station.
