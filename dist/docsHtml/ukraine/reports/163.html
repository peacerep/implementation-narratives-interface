<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between 20 September and 3 October, the SMM recorded an increase in the number of ceasefire violations – 4,234 compared with 3,742 in the previous two-week period. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The Mission continued to monitor the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote and Petrivske, recording 59 ceasefire violations inside the area near Petrivske. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The SMM corroborated reports of four civilian casualties  – four men injured due to shelling  in  non-government-controlled  Donetsk  city’s  Kuibyshevskyi  district  on  17 September.  This  brings  the  total  number  of  confirmed  civilian  casualties  since  the beginning  of  2021  to  72  (15  fatalities  and  57  injuries).  Overall,  in  September  2021, the  SMM  confirmed  eight  civilian  casualties,  all  due  to  shelling.  In  2021,  this  is  the second  highest  number  of  civilian  casualties  in  one  month,  following  August,  when the  SMM  confirmed  12  civilian  casualties  in  total,  including  11  due  to  shelling,  the highest number of such cases since July 2020.

<p><a id="3" name="3">  The Mission’s freedom of movement was restricted 21 times, including 20 instances in  non-government-controlled  areas.  SMM  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAVs)  were assessed as targeted by small-arms fire on ten occasions: three times in government-controlled  and  seven  times  in  non-government-controlled  areas.  Once  a  UAV  flight was cancelled due to cease-fire violations assessed as a live-fire training in the securi-ty zone. Mission UAVs experienced signal interference assessed as caused by proba-ble  jamming  on  170  occasions,  including  18  instances  involving  long-range  UAVs, while flying on both sides of the contact line. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The Mission continued to observe civilians while crossing, or attempting to cross, the contact line and the challenges they face. The SMM again noted that the only cross-ing points open to civilian use were near Stanytsia Luhanska, open daily, and Novo-troitske/Olenivka, open twice a week, as the corresponding checkpoint of the armed formations is open for crossing only on Mondays and Fridays. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The  SMM  continued  to  facilitate  and  monitor  adherence  to  localized  ceasefires  to enable  repairs  and  operation  of  critical  civilian  infrastructure  on  both  sides  of  the contact  line, including repairs to power lines in Staromykhailivka and Donetsk city’s Petrovskyi district, maintenance of a phenol sludge reservoir near Nelipivka, and the construction  of  a  sewage  system  at  the  entry-exit  checkpoint  near  Stanytsia Luhanska. </a></p>
