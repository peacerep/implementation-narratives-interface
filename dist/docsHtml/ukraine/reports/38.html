<p><a id="0" name="0"> One SMM patrol member died and two members were taken to hospital 
on 23 April after their vehicle was severely damaged by an explosion 
close to “LPR”-controlled Pryshyb, possibly after coming into 
contact with a mine (see: www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-toukraine/312971).

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1"> Following the incident, SMM Chief Monitor Ertugrul Apakan issued 
a statement (see: www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-toukraine/312986), while on 28 April, the OSCE Permanent Council expressed their support for the SMM and called for a swift investigation 
(see: www.osce.org/chairmanship/314331).

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> The three SMM casualties are among 154 civilians killed or injured by 
mines or unexploded ordnance in incidents recorded by the SMM since 
the beginning of 2016. No one has been held accountable.

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3"> The SMM’s operations in Donetsk and Luhansk regions remained 
restricted following the fatal incident of 23 April near Pryshyb; these 
restrictions continued to limit the Mission’s observations.

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4"> Two additional security incidents occurred on 28 April, both in areas 
controlled by the so-called “LPR”, in which an explosion and small-arms 
fire occurred close to SMM monitors (see: www.osce.org/specialmonitoring-mission-to-ukraine/314456). No SMM personnel were injured or assets were damaged.

</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5"> The Mission has continued to observe violence along the contact line, 
with hundreds of explosions recorded daily. Weapons proscribed by the 
Minsk agreements are observed by the SMM on a regular basis in 
violation of withdrawal lines.
