<p><a id="0" name="0"> Between 10 and 23 December 2018, the SMM confirmed that three civilians were injured. 
This brings the total number of civilian casualties since 1 January 2018 to 225 (43 deaths 
and 182 injuries).  

</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1"> The SMM recorded about 13,600 ceasefire violations (as compared with over 20,000 in the 
previous  two-week  period)  and  221  weapons  in  violation  of  the  agreed  withdrawal  lines 
(36 in areas not controlled by the Government). 

</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2"> The Mission continued to observe positions, hardware, personnel and other indications of 
military  presence,  and  recorded  around  200  ceasefire  violations  inside  the  Zolote  
disengagement  area.  Residents  of  the  Vilnyi  area  of  Zolote-4/Rodina,  immediately  east-
north-east of the disengagement area, told the SMM that, due to the worsening security 
situation, many residents had relocated to government-controlled Zolote-1/Soniachnyi.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3"> The  SMM  continued  to  observe  long  queues  of  people  waiting  to  cross  the  contact  line 
near  Stanytsia  Luhanska.  In  addition  to  often  lengthy  security  checks,  civilians  passing 
through what is the only crossing point in Luhansk region must walk about 2km between 
forward positions and at one point, where the now destroyed Stanytsia Luhanska bridge 
stands, along often snow-covered, slippery wooden ramps. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4"> The  Mission  continued  to  face  restrictions  to  its  freedom  of  movement  and  other  
impediments  to  the  implementation  of  its  mandate.  Mines  and  unexploded  ordnance 
continued to restrict the Mission’s access to all three disengagement areas and elsewhere. 
In addition, the SMM’s freedom of movement was restricted on 28 occasions; 24 times in 
areas  not  controlled  by  the  Government,  mostly  in  areas  close  to  the  border  with  the  
Russian  Federation  and  along  the  coast  of  the  Azov  Sea.  Small-arms  fire  was  directed  at 
SMM unmanned aerial vehicles on five occasions.
