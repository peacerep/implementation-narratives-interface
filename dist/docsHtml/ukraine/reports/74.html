<p><a id="5" name="5">The ongoing violence resulted in a number of civilian casualties, with two people killed and 19 
injured.</a></p>

<p><a id="8" name="8">The SMM’s freedom of movement remained restricted due to the presence of mines and 
unexploded ordnance on both sides of the contact line, as well as due to other restrictions, 
mostly denial of access, by members of the armed formations (22 times) and by the Ukrainian 
Armed Forces (12 times).</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">In one incident on 30 May, in a non-government-controlled area near 
Petrivske, an SMM patrol heard an explosion less than 300m from its location 
(www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/383014).</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">In another incident on 7 June, in 
government-controlled Pivdenne, SMM patrol members heard warning shots fired 70-100m from 
them (www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/383895).</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">In addition, the sides have 
continued to target SMM unmanned aerial vehicles, through jamming and targeting them with 
small-arms fire.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">In one incident on 9 June, an SMM long-range UAV spotted a surface-to-air 
missile system (9K33 Osa) near non-government-controlled Ukrainske and recorded the contrail 
of one missile at approximately the same altitude of the UAV and the launching of a second 
missile passing below the SMM’s UAV.

<p><a id="14" name="14">On 6 June, the Chief Monitor decided to suspend and review the SMM’s enhanced patrolling at 
the Donetsk Filtration Station.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">On 9 June, the SMM successfully facilitated the re-opening of the 
Donetsk Filtration Station, which on the evening of 6 June had stopped its operations following a 
series of ceasefire violations in its vicinity that had endangered both the plant workers and the 
SMM monitors facilitating the workers’ access.</a></p>
