<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  8  and  21  March  2021,  the  SMM  recorded  1,260  ceasefire  viola-tions, compared with 944 in the previous two-week period.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The  SMM  continued  to  monitor  the  disengagement  areas  near  Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote and Petrivske, observing people in the latter two areas and recording one ceasefire violation inside the one near Petrivske.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  During the two-week reporting period, the SMM corroborated three civilian casualties,  including  two  fatalities.  This  brings  the  total  number  of  civilian casualties  that  occurred  since  the  beginning  of  2021  to  four  (two  fatalities and two injuries). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  The Mission observed trench extensions on both sides of the contact line. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The  Mission  continued  to  facilitate  and  monitor  adherence  to  localized ceasefires  to  enable  repairs  to  and  maintenance  and  operation  of  critical civilian  infrastructure  on  both  sides  of  the  contact  line,  including  to  enable emergency  repairs  to  a  power  substation  in  Oleksandrivka  (benefiting around  4,500  civilians)  and  to  complete  repairs  to  power  lines  near  Novo-luhanske and Dolomitne (benefitting about 3,700 civilians). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  The SMM continued to observe civilians facing challenges when crossing, or attempting  to  cross,  the  contact  line.  It  again  noted  that  the  only  crossing points civilians were able to use were near Stanytsia Luhanska (operational daily)  and  Novotroitske/Olenivka  (twice  a  week  as  the  armed  formations’ checkpoint there is only operational on Mondays and Fridays).  
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  The Mission’s freedom of movement on the ground was restricted six times, all in non-government-controlled areas (see Spot Report 3/2021). SMM un-manned aerial vehicles were targeted four times by small-arms fire, twice in government-controlled  and  twice  in  non-government-controlled  areas;  and experienced signal interference assessed as caused by probable jamming on 30 occasions while flying on both sides of the contact line.</a></p>
