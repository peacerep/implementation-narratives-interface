<p><a id="0" name="0"> Between 25 June and 8 July, the OSCE SMM recorded fewer ceasefire violations 
along the contact line – around 9,700. This represents a 27 per cent decrease 
compared with the previous two weeks. The decrease in ceasefire violations was 
accompanied by a reduction in the number of civilian casualties; the SMM 
confirmed that three civilians had been injured compared with 15 injured in the 
previous reporting period.

<p><a id="1" name="1"> The reduction in the level of violence followed the renewed commitment to the 
ceasefire, on the occasion of the summer harvest. The recommitment was agreed 
in Minsk on 27 June and came into effect at 00:01 on 1 July.

<p><a id="2" name="2"> The Special Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office in Ukraine and in 
the Trilateral Contact Group Martin Sajdik and SMM Chief Monitor Ertugrul 
Apakan welcomed the recommitment to cease fire on 6 July. But they noted that 
it needed to be matched by a concrete set of actions to be sustainable including 
the withdrawal of heavy weapons (www.osce.org/chairmanship/386996).

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3"> The Mission continued to observe violations of key provisions of the Minsk 
agreements and related commitments. In particular, it observed weapons in 
violation of withdrawal lines on both sides of the contact line – 107 in 
government- and 157 in non-government-controlled areas. In addition, it 
observed the presence of newly laid mines on both sides of the contact line and 
the presence of armed forces and formations in close proximity to each other as 
well as in residential areas.
