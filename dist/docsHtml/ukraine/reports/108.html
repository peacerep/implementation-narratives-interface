<p><a id="0" name="0">  Between  1  and  14  June,  the  SMM  recorded  a  30-per-cent  reduction  in  the  number  of ceasefire violations (about 6,850, including about 2,750 explosions compared with about 9,850 and about 2,650, respectively, in the previous two-week period).  
</a></p>
<p><a id="1" name="1">  The Mission continued monitoring the security situation in and around the three disen-gagement  areas.  The  SMM  observed  a  calm  situation  inside  the  disengagement  areas near  Stanytsia  Luhanska  and  Zolote,  but  recorded  ceasefire  violations  inside  the  one near Petrivske. Its ability to record ceasefire violations in the disengagement area near Petrivske  was  further  limited  when  one  of  its  cameras  in  the  area  was  destroyed  by small-arms  fire  on  2  June  (see  Spot  Report  29/2020).  The  Mission  observed  ongoing fortification work and/or trench extensions near all three disengagement areas, and the presence  of  people  during  evening  and  night  hours  near  former  positions  inside  the disengagement areas near Petrivske and Zolote.    
</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">  The  Mission  corroborated  reports  of  three  civilian  casualties,  all  injuries,  bringing  the total since the beginning of 2020 to 51 (six fatalities and 45 injuries).  
</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">  On  13  and  14  June,  the  SMM  observed  arranged  civilian  crossings  in  both  directions through the entry-exit checkpoint near Stanytsia Luhanska and the corresponding check-point of the armed formations.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">  The SMM continued to facilitate and monitor adherence to localized ceasefires to ena-ble  repairs  to,  and  construction  and  maintenance  of,  critical  civilian  infrastructure  on both sides of the contact line. This included maintenance of the phenol sludge reservoir near Zalizne and repairs to electricity infrastructure near Obozne, Zolote-5/Mykhailivka, Pervomaisk, Olenivka and Donetsk city’s Petrovskyi district.  
</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">  During  the  reporting  period,  the  SMM  observed  over  870  anti-tank  mines  for  the  first time, including about 300 in fields near residential houses in Vodiane and about 440 (10 of which were near residential houses) in fields near Shyroka Balka. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">  Members of the armed formations continued to deny the SMM passage at checkpoints along official crossing routes in Donetsk and Luhansk regions (see Spot Report 30/2020 and Spot Report 31/2020). Overall, the Mission’s freedom of movement on the ground was  restricted  44  times  (all  in  areas  not  controlled  by  the  Government).  SMM  un-manned aerial vehicles (UAV) were subjected to signal interference on both sides of the contact line on 28 occasions, and were targeted by small-arms fire six times (four times in non-government-controlled areas). </a></p>
