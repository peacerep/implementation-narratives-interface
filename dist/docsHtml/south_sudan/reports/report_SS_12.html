</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">The  quarterly  report  benefitted  from  information  from  various  data  sources,  including 
periodic reports from Agreement institutions and mechanisms, participatory peer-reviews by the 
RJMEC  thematic  Working  Committees,  Reconstituted  Joint  Monitoring  and  Evaluation 
Commission  (RJMEC)  monthly  plenary  meetings,  and  consultative  meetings  with  various  R-

</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">Notwithstanding  the  positive  progress  made  in  the  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS

<p><a id="78" name="78">

</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">Furthermore, the report observes the main impediments to effective implementation of the

timely manner, and that the peace process remains on track, the RJMEC leadership continued with 
high-level  diplomatic  engagements  with  various  stakeholders  during  the  reporting  period.  </a></p>

<p><a id="208" name="208">On  8  May  2021,  H.E.  Salva  Kiir  Mayardit,  President  of  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan 
dissolved  the  TNL  comprising  the  TNLA  and  the  CoS.  Two  days  later,  the  President 
reconstituted  the  TNLA  from  332  members  to  550  based  on  the  responsibility-sharing 
arrangement provided for under article 1.14.2 of  the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="209" name="209">By the end of the reporting 
period, the CoS was yet to be reconstituted. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="210" name="210">10.  </a></p>
<p><a id="211" name="211">RJMEC’s preliminary gender analysis of the appointments to the reconstituted TNLA 
suggests that, overall, women constitute 33% of its members, falling short of the 35% minimum 
threshold the R-ARCSS requires the Parties to adhere to, and the gender disaggregation of the 
appointments remains a concern.</a></p>
<p><a id="212" name="212">That notwithstanding, the appointment of the RTNLA is a 
welcome development insofar as implementation of the governance aspects of the Agreement 
under Chapter 1 is concerned.</a></p>
<p><a id="213" name="213">However, it is critical that the RTNLA is sworn in to commence 
its  business,  including  passage  of  the  national  budget  and  ratification  of  important  pending 
legislations, such as all the amended security bills and the Constitutional Amendment Bill No. 
8 (2020).

<p><a id="216" name="216">Whereas  State  Executive  structures  were  established  in  the  first  quarter  of  2021,  the

<p><a id="219" name="219">With regard to Judicial Reforms under Article 1.17 of the R-ARCSS, the following tasks 
were expected to have been completed within the first twelve months of the Transitional Period 
namely:</a></p>
<p><a id="220" name="220">establishment of the ad-hoc JRC and completion of its activities.</a></p>
<p><a id="221" name="221">Once established and

<p><a id="222" name="222">To date, there has been some progress made in this regard.</a></p>
<p><a id="223" name="223">The 
MoJCA, working together with RJMEC and IGAD advisors developed and adopted a Terms 
of Reference for the establishment of the JRC, and plans are underway to invite the Parties to 
the  R-ARCSS  to  nominate  their  representatives  to  the  JRC,  and  for  IGAD  to  secure  its

<p><a id="229" name="229">During  the  reporting  period,  H.E.  Rebecca  Nyandeng  de  Mabior,  Vice  President  and 
Head of the Gender and Youth Cluster launched the South Sudanese Women Leadership Forum 
under the theme:</a></p>
<p><a id="230" name="230">‘</a></p>
<p><a id="231" name="231">Strengthening Women's Participation in Peace and Nation-Building’.</a></p>
<p><a id="232" name="232">The 
Forum  brought  together  South  Sudanese  women  leaders  from  political,  faith-based  groups, 
civil society, private sector, business sector, security sector, justice institutions, academia, and 
media to deliberate on women's leadership role in South Sudan.  
16.  </a></p>
<p><a id="233" name="233">The Forum is established as a platform to assist women in addressing multiple issues 
that prevent  gender equality  and women empowerment  in  various fields, and to  engage and 
hold political and government leaders accountable with regards to promoting and implementing 
all gender related commitments made by the signatories, stakeholders as well as the guarantors 
under the R-ARCSS and the Transitional Constitution of the Republic of South Sudan (TRCSS) 
2011 (as amended).  
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="234" name="234">National Constitutional Amendment Committee

<p><a id="235" name="235">Under  Article  1.18  of  the  R-ARCSS,  the  National  Constitutional  Amendment 
Committee  (NCAC)  was  expected  to  have  completed  drafting,  review  and  amendment  of 
several legislations, including the National Elections Act, the NGO Act, Bank of South Sudan 
Act,  Anti-Corruption  Act,  National  Audit  Chambers  Act,  National  Petroleum  Act  amongst 
other, and to incorporate any reforms relevant to the Agreement or international best practices, 
within twelve months into the Transitional Period. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="236" name="236">18.  </a></p>
<p><a id="237" name="237">By  22  February  2021,  when  the  NCAC’s  mandate  expired,  it  was  in  the  process  of 
reviewing the Public Finance Management Act and the National Audit Chambers Act, but these 
were yet to be finalised and handed over to the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="238" name="238">The  NCAC  had  also  started  the  review  of  the  Petroleum  Act  and  Petroleum  Revenue 
Management Act.  
19. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="239" name="239">In  order  to  complete  these  pending  laws,  as  well  as  review  and  amend  the  National 
Elections Act and the NGO Act, the NCAC requested for extension of its mandate for another 
twelve (12) months.</a></p>
<p><a id="240" name="240">All the Parties to the R-ARCSS endorsed the request for an extension of 
the NCAC working period.</a></p>
<p><a id="241" name="241">However, due to financial challenges, the IGAD office has not yet 
reconvened  the  NCAC.  </a></p>

allegedly SSPDF personnel.</a></p>
<p><a id="248" name="248">Both the SSPDF and NAS denied responsibility for the incidents, 
but the SSPDF issued a statement stating that they were going to launch an investigation into 
the matter.</a></p>
<p><a id="249" name="249">RJMEC has recommended that CTSAMVM also investigate the incident.  
21.  </a></p>
<p><a id="250" name="250">Community-based  violence  persisted  throughout  the  reporting  period,  across  the 
Equatorias.</a></p>
<p><a id="251" name="251">Most incidents involved cattle raiding and revenge attacks between the Bor Dinka 
and  Mundari  tribes.  </a></p>
<p><a id="252" name="252">Also,  communal  violence  between  the  Buya  and  Toposa  tribes,  youth 
harassment  of  humanitarian  workers,  as  well  as  ambushes  on  civilian  vehicles  by  criminal 
groups  worsened  the  security  situation  in  Eastern  Equatoria.  </a></p>
<p><a id="253" name="253">On  31  May  in  Torit,  Eastern 
Equatoria, vehicles belonging to the UNDP and the International Community of the Red Cross 
(ICRC) were looted and personnel robbed by local youth.</a></p>
<p><a id="254" name="254">Of much concern is the major threat 
to peace posed by inter-communal violence, which has negatively impacted the implementation 
of  the  Agreement  as  some  Cantonment  Sites  have  been  attacked  by  local  youths,  leading 
Cantonment personnel to rearm themselves in self-defence. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="255" name="255">22.  </a></p>
<p><a id="256" name="256">Between  the  areas  of  Bunj  and  Maban  in  Upper  Nile  state,  the  Bantaween  militia 
attacked the Beneshowa community and also the Liang cantonment site.</a></p>
<p><a id="257" name="257">However, the South 
Sudan Liberation Army in Opposition (SPLA)-IO in the area successfully repelled the militia 
attacks.  </a></p>
<p><a id="258" name="258">Also in Jonglei an attack in May 2021 by the Gawar Nuer and the Dinka youth on 
Gumuruk and Likungole was reported to have killed 105 men and 28 women, whilst 72 women 
and 84 children were abducted.</a></p>
<p><a id="259" name="259">On 28 May 2021, community-based violence in Ulang County 
resulted  in  43  civilian  deaths.  </a></p>
<p><a id="260" name="260">In  addition,  on  24  May  2021,  a  humanitarian  warehouse  was 
attacked in Koch County, Unity State by an unknown armed group and over 500 tons of food 
was stolen or destroyed. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="261" name="261">23.  </a></p>
<p><a id="262" name="262">During  the  reporting  period,  National  Monitors  boycotted  participation  in  the 
CTSAMVM structures after financial support from the government of Japan ended in March.</a></p>
<p><a id="263" name="263">
</a></p>
<p><a id="264" name="264">During  the  boycott,  the  National  Monitors  intentionally  prevented  the  regional  and 
international monitors from deploying, monitoring or investigating incidents in all their areas 
of responsibility.</a></p>
<p><a id="265" name="265">Direct threats were made to CTSAMVM personnel by the National Monitors, 
and in some cases with the support of government security agencies.  
24.  </a></p>
<p><a id="266" name="266">These  actions  consequently  significantly  undermined  CTSAMVM’s  operational 
capability  and  performance.  </a></p>
<p><a id="267" name="267">Consequently,  the  RJMEC  Chairperson  wrote  to  the  President 
requesting his intervention in the matter.  </a></p>
<p><a id="268" name="268">During the last week of June 2021,  funds were made 
available to CTSAMVM by the Chairperson of the National Transitional Committee (NTC), 
for  the  specific  purpose  of  providing  salaries    for  the  National  Monitors,  thus  successfully 
resolving the issue.</a></p>
<p><a id="269" name="269">The National Monitors  resumed work on 22 June 2021. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="270" name="270">25.  </a></p>
<p><a id="271" name="271">The  SSPDF  leadership  established  a  Military  Mobile  Court  in  Malual  Chat,  Jonglei 
State, and a General Court Martial in Warrap State to deal with crimes committed by soldiers. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="272" name="272">These are very positive developments similar to the District Field Court Martial established by

both  the  military  and  civilians.  </a></p>
<p><a id="273" name="273">At  the  time,  the  actions  of  the  Court  significantly  improved

this period, CTSAMVM reported on incidents of SPLM/A-IO soldiers who allegedly assaulted 
two girls in Wau IDP camp on 14 June 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="277" name="277">Local police confirmed that there were two other

<p><a id="278" name="278">With regards to accountability, SSPDF established 
military justice mechanisms mentioned above to deal with both military discipline cases as well 
as crimes against civilians in Jonglei and Warrap State.</a></p>
<p><a id="279" name="279">The Court’s jurisdiction includes cases

transfers.</a></p>
<p><a id="347" name="347">Audits of cost recovery (deductions by the oil companies for investment and other 
costs  related  to  oil  production)  since  (2012)  show,  according  government  officials  that  oil

Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="432" name="432">During the discussions 
the RJMEC  Chairperson stressed that the use of EITI systems, together with implementation 
of  other  provisions  in  the  Peace  Agreement  has  great  potential  to  significantly  improve 
transparency in the oil, and minerals sectors as the challenges in disclosure of contracts and 
licenses granted to oil and gas and mining companies are addressed.

</a></p>
<p><a id="510" name="510">Conclusion 

63. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="511" name="511">The report shows that whereas some provisions of the R-ARCSS were implemented 
during the period under  review, overall, its critical  aspects  such as operationalization of the 
TNL to enable them to enact laws, completion of Phase I of the unification of forces, including 
operationalization  of  the  DDR  processes,  were  not  given  the  attention  they  deserve  by  the 
RTGoNU.  </a></p>
<p><a id="512" name="512">Consequently,  the  expected  changes  from  the  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS 
during the quarter did not positively impact the lives of ordinary citizens, particularly at the 
subnational level.</a></p>
<p><a id="513" name="513">It is therefore critical that the RTGoNU focuses its attention more to ensure 
effective and efficient implementation of the outstanding tasks on governance and Transitional 
Security Arrangements, as they are the bedrocks of the R-ARCSS.  
64. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="514" name="514">Furthermore,  the  RTGoNU  needs  to  take  steps  to  ensure  that  all  the  Agreement 
institutions  mechanisms  are  established,  the  necessary  institutional  reform  processes  are 
undertaken  in  a  time  fashion,  financial  and  in-kind  resources  mobilized,  and  the  permanent 
constitution-making process progresses as planned.</a></p>
<p><a id="515" name="515">With only 20 months remaining to the end 
of the Transitional Period, there is need to ensure that the outstanding tasks of the R-ARCSS 
are simultaneously implemented.</a></p>
<p><a id="516" name="516">For this to happen, it requires the requisite political will of 
the RTGoNU, continued support from the regional and international guarantors, as well as the 
goodwill and support of all involved. 
65. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="517" name="517">On its part and pursuant to its mandate as provided for in Chapter 7 of the R-ARCSS, 
the RJMEC will continue to monitor, evaluate, report on the status of implementation of the R-
ARCSS, as circumstances demand, intervene to break any deadlock that may emerge in the 
course of implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="518" name="518">It will regularly provide reports and briefings to the RTGoNU, the 
reconstituted TNLA, Chairperson of the IGAD Assembly of Heads of State and Government, 
Chairperson  of  the  IGAD  Council  of  Ministers,  the  Chairperson  of  the  African  Union 
Commission, the Peace and Security Council of the African Union and to the Secretary General 
of the United Nations and the Security Council of the United Nations.</a></p>
