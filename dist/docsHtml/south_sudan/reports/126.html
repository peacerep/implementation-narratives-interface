CTSAMVM REPORT 2022/12
VIOLATIONS AGAINST CIVILIANS INCLUDING SGBV IN CENTRAL
EQUATORIA STATE
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
CTSAMVM was made aware of and investigated one case of rape against an elderly
disabled woman perpetrated by one SSPDF soldier in Wotogo Boma, Otogo Payam,
Yei River County on 26 Feb 2022.
</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">The second case is the arrest and detention of civilians including a pregnant woman
perpetrated by the SSPDF Mobile Force Unit at Abegi Barracks.
</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">Following the incidents of beating civilians, arresting civilians, looting property and
raping an elderly disabled woman which took place in Wotogo Boma, the SSPDF
arrested 16 soldiers including the commanders of the Mobile Unit.
</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">It is the conclusion of this CTSAMVM investigation that Mr Karasvino Luate and
Moses Lasu have been unlawfully detained for more than two months in SSPDF Yei
Barracks, as they have not been charged in any Court of law and neither have they
been handed over to Police to be held in civil prison as per the requirement of the
law.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">CTSAMVM further concludes that by failing to protect civilians (especially
women and girls), and by failing to control their soldiers and thus they commit rape,
the SSPDF has acted in violation of articles (2)(g),  (2)(a), (3) and (b) of the
ACOH of 21 December 2017, and articles 2.1.10.0, 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0.1  and
2.0.10.0.5  of the R-ARCSS of 12 September 2018.

<p><a id="15" name="15">i

a. In December 2020, CTSAMVM published a   ort'(2020/09) on SGBV
trends, which suggested that SGBV cases perpetrated by military personnel
had reduced since the signing of the R-ARCSS, and that there was
evidence that the Parties were increasingly accepting responsibility for the
actions of their soldiers and holding those involved accountable for their
actions.

b. However, violence against civilians including SGBV by military personnel
remains a serious challenge in Southern Central Equatoria State.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">Since the
signing of the R-ARCSS, CTSAMVM has so far reported 12 cases of
rape/SGBV in the area,  of which were attributed to the SSPDF.

</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">c. The situation seemed to have improved until recently in February/March
2022 when CTSAMVM received information about the arrest and detention
of civilians and rape of an elderly disabled woman both of which involved
SSPDF soldiers of Abegi Barracks in Yei River County, Central Equatoria
State.

2. Incidents:</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">

a. This report covers two incidents:</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">

i. Incident :</a></p>

b. All incidents involved armed and uniformed SSPDF soldiers.

</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">c. After the two incidents, 16 SSPDF soldiers were arrested and are to face
Court Martial in Yei.

FINDINGS
5.     </a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">Incident :</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">

a. On the morning of 25 Feb 2022, an SSPDF soldier by the name Sgt Manyeil
Ajai went to the nearby villages in search of foodstuffs from the community, he
disappeared and did not return to his duty station at SSPDF Abegi Barracks,
in Abegi Sub Boma.

b. The said soldier was last seen alive in the company of  persons from
Pakakule village of Abegi Sub Boma.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">The three persons are Mr. Karasvino
Luate, Mr. Moses Lasu and Mr. Alberto Lubari Tomas.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">They were seen taking
alcohol at Mr. Alberto Lubari’s home in Pakakule village until sunset on 25
Feb 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">Thereafter, Mr. Alberto Lubari accompanied the soldier to the Yei-
Lasu main road which is about 3.0  kms from Pakakule Village.

</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">c. At around mid-night of 25 Feb 22, four gunshots were heard from the direction
of Yembe Bridge, located along Yei — Lasu road about 1.0  Kms North East of
SSPDF Abegi Barracks.

d. Early the next morning of 26 Feb 2022, a group of SSPDF Soldiers from
Abegi Barracks went to Yembe and after searching the area, they saw signs
of wrestling with scattered foodstuffs on the ground suspected to be those
collected by the missing soldier at a place about 200 meters from Yembe
Bridge.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">However, the soldiers couldn't get any clues leading them to
whereabouts of Sgt. Manyeil.

</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">•. The SSPDF soldiers went to Pakakule village where Sgt.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">Manyeil was last
seen taking alcohol and arrested eight (8) civilians including a pregnant
woman who is Mr. Alberto Lubari’s (prime suspect) wife.

f. After interrogation, six (6) of the arrested  people were released on 28 Feb
22, while the remaining two (2) persons namely Mr. Karasvino Luate Mineri
and Mr. Moses Lasu Alex were accused of the disappearance of the SSPDF
soldier, Sgt Manyeil Ajai.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">They were detained at SSPDF Abegi Barracks, from
where they were later transferred to SSPDF  Bde HQ in Yei town.

g. After several days of searching for the missing soldier, one SSPDF soldier
going to Lutaya Market on  March 22, noticed a dead body dumped under
Yembe Bridge on Yei — Lasu road after sensing a bad smell while crossing
the bridge.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">He immediately informed SSPDF Abegi Barracks, who then sent a

group of soldiers to the area and pulled out a decomposing body from Yembe
stream, identifying it as the body of Sgt Manyeil.

h. The Medical Officer of SSPDF Abegi Barracks, Sgt Maj John  Lukolalyo
confirmed to CTSAMVM that Sgt Manyiel's death was caused by gunfire, after
being shot two bullets in the back from a very short distance.

</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">i. SSPDF Abegi Soldiers forced about six (6) male civilians to carry the dead
decomposing body to their Barracks in Abegi, where he was later buried.
</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">Abegi soldiers severally invaded Abegi Community and harassed civilians,
looted their properties.

j. All witnesses stated that the prime suspect in the murder of Sgt Manyeil Ajai
is Mr Alberto Lubari Tomas who is on the run and suspected to be hiding in
DRC Refugee camps.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">At the time of writing this report, Mr. Karasvino Luate
and Moses Lasu were still being held at SSPDF  Bde HQs in Yei.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">The Abegi
SSPDF soldiers demanded for blood compensation of Sgt Manyeil before the
two can regain their freedom.

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Incident :</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">

a. The victim, who is an elderly disabled woman was raped according to Yei Civil
Hospital Examination Report.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Unfortunately, the case was not reported to any
police station and hence the victim didn't get police criminal form No 8.

b. The rape incident occurred on 06 March 2022 at about 2100 hrs in the victim’s
house in Pakakule village, Abegi Sub Boma, Wotogo Boma, of Otogo Payam,
Yei River County of Central Equatoria State.

</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">c. On 06 March 22, SSPDF soldiers of Abegi barracks stormed Abegi Sub-
Boma, of Wotogo Payam, arrested and beat up civilians, looted property
following the death of their colleague who was discovered dead after he had
gone missing for six days.

d.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">On the fateful day (6 Mar 22),  SSPDF soldiers entered into Mr. Alberto
Lubari’s (the prime suspect in the killing of SSPDF soldier) house and found
his mother (rape victim), an elderly disabled woman who was staying alone at
home.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">They asked her why she was still in the village while other people had
left the village.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">She replied that, “I am sick and disabled and | have no one to
help me to move, so that is why am still here in the house”.

</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">•. In the statement recorded from the victim, it is stated that, “.........the
soldiers then left her but one of them later came back to her house at
2100hrs and asked her to come out of the house, she declined telling
him it was late and she could not move because she was sick.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">She
further said that the soldier insisted and pointed a gun at her while his
face was masked up with a cloth and he pulled her mattress and threw it
outside and forced her outside, where he then picked a polythene bag
wrapped around his penis, raped her, and then left”.

</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">f. Being alone in the house and disabled, the victim couldn’t immediately report
the case to the police or any other appropriate authorities.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">After staying for
four days, on  Mar 2022, she crawled to the secretary's house one Mr.
Amule Samuel where she narrated to him what had happened to her and then
Mr. Amule Samuel facilitated her travel to ECSS IDP Camp in Yei town.

g. When the ECSS IDP Camp Deputy Chairperson got to know, he immediately
communicated with an NGO staff, who then took the victim to Yei Civil
Hospital where she was given medication and counselling services.

h. The place where the woman was raped, i.•. Pakakule village in Abegi Sub
Boma, Wotogo Boma of Otogo payam falls under the area of responsibility of
the SSPDF Mobile Unit currently based at Abegi Barracks which is
responsible for providing security and protection to the civilian community.

</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">i. The victim is an elderly disabled widow with a son named Mr. Alberto Lubari
Tomas who is 35 years old with whom they used to live in Pakakule village.

The son is the prime suspect in the killing of an SSPDF soldier who suddenly
disappeared and the mother does not know his whereabouts.

j. Before raping the victim, the armed soldier, asked her the whereabouts of her
son to imply that he is the one who killed the SSPDF soldier, and then he
(the soldier) threatened to kill the victim if she did not comply with his orders.

k. All the statements provided by the witnesses indicate that the rape incident
was in revenge for the death of the SSPDF soldier named Sgt Manyeil Ajai
suspected to have been killed by Mr Alberto Lubari, (the victim's son).

|.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">The prime suspect of the rape incident was Cpl Lual Deng Tonga, (as identified
and confirmed by SSPDF 1Bde Intelligence Officer) who disappeared from
SSPDF Abegi Barrack since the rape incident.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">He hid himself in the bushes until
when he showed up at SSPDF Morsaq Barracks in Otogo Payam at about 0200
hrs on 11 Mar 22, in possession of his weapon.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">When he was stopped at the
quarter guard, he defied the order to stop.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">Upon being warned several times, he
continued moving forward and being late in the night and he could not identify
himself he was shot dead.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">His body was picked and taken to SSPDF  Bde
ground force HQ in Yei where he was buried.

</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">Actions by the SSPDF:</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">

6.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">Following the incidents of beating civilians, arresting civilians, looting property
and raping an elderly disabled woman which took place in Wotogo Boma, the
SSPDF arrested 16 soldiers including the commanders of the Mobile Unit as
confirmed by the Military Intelligence officer of SSPDF 1Bde HQ.

ASSESSMENT

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">The act of invading civilian villages, harassing civilians, threatening them by
shooting in the air, forcing them to carry a body of the dead soldier, beating them
up and looting property by the SSPDF soldiers to the point of leaving their homes
to seek refuge at ECSS IDP Camp in Yei town is illegal and against the

requirement and duty to protect civilians as per Peace Agreements, ACoH of 2017
and R-ARCSS of 2018.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">The two civilians Mr. Karasvino Luate, and Moses Lasu are being detained by
the SSPDF  Bde HQs in Yei County, without a court warrant, and have been
unlawfully deprived of their fundamental human rights of due process before any
court of law.

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">The SSPDF neither has the jurisdiction to detain nor to try civilians suspected of
a civil offence.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">It is illegal for the SSPDF to hold these suspects for over  months
without trial.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">The responsibility to arrest and prosecute civilian suspects lie with
the Police hence upon arrest, the SSPDF should have handed them over to the
Police for prosecution.

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">All the above actions by SSPDF constitute violation of the R-ARCSS provisions,
Articles 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0.1, 2.0.10.0.4, 2.0.10.0.5  and ACoH,
Protection of civilians and Humanitarian Access;</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">Articles  (1),  (1),  (a), (c),
(i) among others.

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">According to the engagements made by CTSAMVM, there is sufficient evidence
to confirm that a crime of rape was committed against the victim on 06 March
2022 at about 2100 hrs by an SSPDF soldier, known as Cpl Lual Deng Tonga,
and that the crime was not reported/booked at any police station but was
reported to the local civil authority after four days.

12.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">The incident of civilian harassment and subsequent rape is a clear violation of
ACOH Articles 3.0) (g), Art  (b) and R-ARCSS Articles 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0,
ZV AOA, 24.0.

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">Intimidating and finally raping an elderly and disabled woman is a clear violation
of R-ARCSS Articles 2.0.10.0  and 2.0.10.0.5
14.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">The Commander of SSPDF Mobile Force Unit at Abegi Barracks failed to
exercise his responsibility of command and control of his troops to stop the
incidents that happened in Abegi resulting to violation of ACoH Art  1),  (a, b, c
andi) and R-ARCSS Art.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">2.0.2.

CONCLUSIONS

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">It is the conclusion of this CTSAMVM investigation that two civilians;</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">Mr
Karasvino Luate and Moses Lasu have been unlawfully detained for more than
two months in SSPDF Yei Barracks, as they have not been charged in any Court
of law and neither have they been handed over to Police to be held in civil prison
as per the requirement of the law.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">Detaining civilians in a military custody is not
compatible with South Sudanese law on regulations governing handling of
suspects.

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">CTSAMVM concludes that by failing to protect civilians (especially women and
girls), and by failing to control their soldiers and thus they commit rape, the
SSPDF has acted in violation of articles (2)(g),  (2)(a), (3) and (b) of the
ACOH of 21 December 2017, and articles 2.1.10.0, 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0.1  and
2.0.10.0.5  of the R-ARCSS of 12 September 2018.

17.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">CTSAMVM has reasonable grounds to believe that an SSPDF soldier, Cp! Lual
Deng Tonga raped an elderly and disabled woman, which constitutes a clear
violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically Articles 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0.1,
2.0.10.0.4, 2.0.10.0.5  and ACoH Articles  2) (g), Art  (b).

RECOMMENDATIONS

18.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">It is recommended that SSPDF  Bde HQs transfers the two detained civilians
Mr. Karasvino Luate and Moses Lasu to civilian detention facilities under the
control of Yei County Police instead of detaining them in military detention
facilities.

19.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">The County Authorities should ensure that the two detained civilians are either
freed or receive due process in accordance with South Sudanese law.

20.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">The JDB/SSPDF Unified Command should condemn the action by SSPDF  Bde
officers to detain civilians in military camps for more than two months without any
legal trial or a valid arrest warrant from a National court.

21.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">The SSPDF in coordination with the National Police and appropriate National
Authorities should do whatever is possible within the law to arrest the prime
suspect of murdering the SSPDF Soldier;</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">Mr. Alperto Lubari and the process of
arrest be pursued using appropriate government channels from the refugee camp
in DRC where he is suspected to be.

22.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">SSPDF Commanders be made aware of their roles to adhere to the Peace
Agreements, ACoH of 2017 and R-ARCSS of 2018.

23.</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">Violations of the R-ARCSS are reported for purposes of remedial action and
accountability.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">The action taken by the SSPDF to arrest the 16 soldiers who
were involved in the incidents of beating civilians and looting civilians’ property is
commendable.

24.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">That SSPDF leadership should consider compensating the victim since the
suspected perpetrator is deceased.

25.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">The police in Yei County should embark on creating awareness to the population
about the value and importance of reporting cases of Sexual and Gender Based
Violence.

26.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">SSPDF leadership should ensure that the Commanders are properly guided on
their roles of command responsibility and the need to adhere and comply to the
Peace Agreements particularly the protection of women and girls R-ARCSS
specifically Articles 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0.1, 2.0.10.0.5  and ACoH Articles
