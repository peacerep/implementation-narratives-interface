Your Excellency,
Please find attached a CTSAMM report on violations of the Permanent Ceasefire and
Transitional Security Arrangements (Chapter II of the Agreement on the Resolution of the
Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan of 26 August 2015) that took place in Nassir, Upper Nile

CTSAMM REPORT NUMBER 012
VIOLATIONS IN NASSIR UPPER NILE STATE
Executive Summary
On  March 2016 a Government Forces soldier based at the garrison in Nassir went
over to the SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">This precipitated an exchange of fire.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">The following morning a
300-strong force left the garrison and moved east through Nassir town towards the area
of Kedbeck, which is under the control of SPLM/A-IO Forces.
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">As the Government Forces passed through the market area of Nassir town a number of
traders, who were setting up their stalls, were rounded up by Government Forces
soldiers who then opened fire on them.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">At least  were killed.
</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">The advance continued past the UNMISS compound to Kedbeck, which resulted in
some heavy fighting which went on for  hours and resulted in the deaths of about 
Government and  SPLM/A-IO soldiers.
</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">It is the opinion of the CTSAMM that in leaving their garrison in such numbers and
advancing on SPLM/A-IO positons Government Forces were in clear violation of the
PCTSA.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">Furthermore, the apparent killing of civilians in the market place constitutes
not only a violation of the PCTSA, but also of international law.
VIOLATIONS IN NASSIR, UPPER NILE STATE
1.0  Introduction
1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">

</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">•</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">Up until March 2015 there was considerable tension in the Nassir area,
with several clashes between SPLM/A-IO forces and those of the
Government based in the town.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">Most clashes took place to the east of
Nassir in the Kedbeck area, which is regularly patrolled by Government
Forces but under the observation and fire of SPLM/A-IO Forces.

</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">•</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">The town itself has been deserted since the start of the current crisis,
although in recent months some civilians have returned to the market,
against the wishes of the SDPLM/A-IO.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">Since March 2015 the area has been quiet.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">There was no reported build-
up of tension prior to the incidents which took place on - March 2016.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">

investigations for JMEC with assessments and recommendations.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">

1.1  Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">

</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">•</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">The MVT based in Nassir was not there at the time of the incidents, having
been deployed to Juba to assist with other investigations and verifications.
</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">The Nassir team had been selected because Nassir had been quiet for so
long.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">The MVT returned to Nassir soon after the incidents in order to
investigate.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">The investigation lasted from -14 March 2016.

</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">•</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">The MVT was able to interview a wide range of witnesses, including
Government Forces officers and soldiers, SPLM/A-IO Forces Officers and
soldiers, a civilian witness to alleged killings in Nassir, a Government Forces
soldier who had defected to the SPLM/A-IO and SPLM/A-IO civil officials.
</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">The MVT was also able to gain information from UNMISS personnel who had
witnessed the clashes.

</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">•</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Locations:</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">During the course of the investigation, the MVT visited the
Government Forces HQ, the market in Nassir and also the area in Kedbeck
where the fighting took place and near where they met SPLM/A-lIO
representatives.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">

2.0  VIOLATIONS IN NASSIR, UPPER NILE STATE

2.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">Between  February and  March 2016 the Government Forces garrison at
Nassir lost  soldiers to the SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">The Government Forces claim that they
were kidnapped by the SPLM/A-IO, but this is denied by the SPML/A-IO who
claim the soldiers defected.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">On the evening of  March a soldier from the
garrison went over to the SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">This precipitated an exchange of fire
during which two SPLM/A-IO soldiers were reportedly wounded.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">The MVT was
able to interview the soldier who went over to the SPLM/A-IO on the evening of
 March:</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">he gave his name and number and stated he was not kidnapped but
defected to the SPLM/A-IO of his own free will (see Annex A Photograph 1).</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">The
SPLM/A-IO claimed that the other  missing Government soldiers were serving
in their ranks, although the MVT cannot confirm this as they did not see them.
</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">The defector they interviewed claimed to have seen two of them.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">

</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">2.2  </a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">On the morning of  March 2016 Government Forces moved out of their base in
force.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">At about 7.0  hrs heavy gunfire was heard from the direction of the
market in Nassir.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">It is apparent that a number of civilians were killed.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">The MVT

saw two dead bodies in the area used by traders and also three fresh graves
(see Annex a photographs ,  and 4).</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">A local Community Liaison Officer
reported he had helped dig the graves and bury three of the people who had
been shot.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">One trader escaped to the SPLM/A-lO-held area and was interviewed
by the MVT (see Annex A Picture5).</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">He claimed 12 people — traders — were
rounded up by Government Forces soldiers who suddenly opened fire on them.
</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">The story given by Government Forces officers varied:</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">the Force Commander,
Brigadier Peter Oyual Kor claimed he heard there had been an ambush in the
market but denied any knowledge of casualties.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">The Battalion Commander,
Lieutenant Colonel Juma Suileiman stated there had been no fighting and denied
the existence of any dead bodies.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">The MVT can confirm that at least  people
were killed (the two bodies they saw and the three fresh graves).

2.0  Following the incident in the market Government Forces moved east towards
Kedbek.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">The troops were supported by two troop-carrying landcruisers, one
landcruiser mounting a heavy machine gun and one armoured vehicle, also
mounting a heavy machine gun.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">UNMISS estimated their numbers at about 300.
</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">They passed the UNMISS compound at about 0750 Hrs. UNMISS observers
witnessed the Government Forces firing randomly towards the Kedbeck area.

2.1  Heavy firing was heard starting at about 8.0  Hrs and going on to about 12.0 
Hrs from the area of Kedbeck.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">The Government Forces commanders admitted
they had taken casualties during the fighting.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">SPLM/A-IO commanders claimed
to have killed  Government soldiers and to have lost  of their own, with a
proportionate number of wounded on each side.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">The MVT interviewed the
SPLM/A-IO Acting Governor of ‘Latjot State’ Jundid Both Dukhan, Major General
John Chuol Nguot, the operations officer of  Division SPLM/A-IO and Colonel
Biel Gany Koang, a Brigade Commander of  Divisions SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">They also
talked to private soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">All claimed that they had been attacked by
Government Forces, and that by fighting back they were defending themselves.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">

</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">

3.1  It is not possible to say whether or not the SPLM/A-IO had been involved in
capturing Government Forces soldiers prior to the incidents described, but the
soldier interviewed by the MVT who had gone to the SPLM/A-IO on the evening
of  March without doubt defected of his own free will.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">He claimed that he had
seen two of the other missing soldiers in the ranks of the SPLM/A-IO, and the
names given by the SPLM/A-IO of those they claimed defected to them matched
the list of missing soldiers provided by Government Forces.

3.2.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">No information was given by any of the Government Forces officers in Nassir to
suggest there had been at actual attack by the SPLM/A-IO against their positions
on  March 2016 as described in the allegation.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">There was an exchange of fire
when the Government Forces soldier went over to the SPLM/A-IO.

3.3  Government Forces moblised in strength on the morning of  March and moved
east through the town.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">As they moved through the market area there was
shooting, and a number of civilian traders were killed.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">MVT cannot confirm the
number but two bodies and three fresh graves were seen.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">The bodies were in
civilian clothes.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">There is no evidence to suggest that there had been any sort of
ambush of Government Forces as they moved through the market area of Nassir.
</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">All the evidence suggests that Government Forces did for some reason shoot a
number of civilian traders who had gone to Nassir to set up their stalls that
morning.</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">This constitutes a clear violation of the PCTSA.

3.4.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">The very fact that Government Forces moved in strength out of their garrison and
towards an area which is occupied by SPLM/A-IO is in itself a clear violation of
the PCTSA.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">If Government Forces believed that SPLM/A-IO Forces had been
kidnapping their soldiers this should have been sent as an allegation to CTSAMM
of JMCC.

</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">4.0  Conclusion

4.1  Itis the opinion of CTSAMM that on  March 2016 in Nassir Government Forces
violated Article 1.0  of the PCTSA, particularly:</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">

</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">•</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">Article 1.1  of the COHA:</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">“The Parties hereby agree to cease all military
actions aimed at each other....”

•</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">Article 1.2.5:</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">“Acts of hostility, intimidation, violence or attacks against the
civilian population......”.

5.0  Recommendations and observations:</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">

5.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">CTSAMM recommends that Government Forces conduct an investigation into
the incidents in Nassir.

5.2  CTSAMM notes that the allegations from the two Parties both came from
members of JMCC, and that JMCC is the forum where issues that could or do
lead to conflict should be addressed.</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">In the spirit of the Peace Agreement there

should be dialogue between the Parties at the local level in Nassir to ensure
incidents such as this will not happen again.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">

</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">5.3  </a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">These violations are unacceptable, and those responsible should be held to
account.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">Furthermore, CTSAMM calls upon the Parties to ensure that all their
personnel are provided with relevant guidance and orders, so that those who do
target civilians or engage in active hostilities understand they will be made to
face the consequences.
