<p><a id="74" name="74">The SSPDF did not follow the
attackers.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">

</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">c. The SSPDF commander of Logwili barracks, Col Aligo, Logwili stated that the

<p><a id="88" name="88">Assessment

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">The civilian area of Logwili barracks — where married soldiers live with their
families — was attacked by an armed group on the morning of  November 2021.
</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">It was a surprise attack, during which tukuls were burnt and goods stolen.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">

12.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">CTSAMVM attributes the responsibility for conducting the attack to NAS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">This is
because:</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">

</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">a. An armed group abducted a group of civilians the day before the attack.
</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">Members of this armed group identified themselves as NAS, and this was
confirmed to CTSAMVM by one of the abductees.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">The group was close to
Logwili when the abductees were released a few hours before the attack and
it is probable that the abduction and subsequent attack were coordinated.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">

</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">b. Several sources reported that NAS had been operating in the area and had
bases to the north of Logwili.</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">There have been previous incidents of
ambushes on SSPDF vehicles and civilian traffic on the Juba-Lainya road
which were attributed to NAS.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">Witnesses stated that the attackers came from
the north and departed in the same direction.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">

</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">c. There are no other identified armed groups in the area apart from NAS.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">The
only military presence is SSPDF, there are no SPLM/A-IO units in the vicinity
of Logwili.

</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">d. The dead attacker was identified by two witnesses to be a member of NAS.

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">Following the attack, the local community are fearful of further violence.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">Families
have been displaced as a result of their homes being destroyed and for fear of
more attacks.</a></p>

Conclusions

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">CTSAMVM concludes that NAS attacked Logwili Barracks on the morning of 
November 2021 causing the deaths of  soldiers, a policeman and a civilian
woman, and in doing so they acted in clear violation of the ACOH 24 December
2017, specifically Articles  and .</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">

</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">Observations and Recommendations

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">NAS -as part of SSOMA — agreed to a ceasefire in Rome at the beginning of
2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">As well as acting in violation of the ACOH, this attack went against both
the word and the spirit of the Rome Declaration and Resolution.

</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">16.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">Civilians continue to suffer because of ongoing conflict between NAS and the
SSPDF in Central Equatoria State.</a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">CTSAMVM recommends all Parties involved
to re-commit to the Rome process, and for NAS to honour the obligations it has
under the ACOH                                                       yi
