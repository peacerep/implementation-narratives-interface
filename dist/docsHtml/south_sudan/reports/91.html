FIGHTING IN NASSIR, UPPER NILE STATE
1.0  Introduction
1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">Tensions have been high in the Nassir area throughout the current conflict.
</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">There have been numerous outbreaks of fighting;</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">the last two major
incidents reported by CTSAMM concerned offensive operations by
Government Forces in March 2016 (report # 12) and an attack by SPLM/A-
</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">lO at the end of July 2016 (report #26).

•</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">In late November 2016 the situation in the Nassir area once again became
violent, and through December and into January there have been clashes
between Government and Opposition Forces, and from 26 December 2016
significant offensive operations by Government Forces.

1.2  Incidents:</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The incidents covered by this report are as follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">

1.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">Aim</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">:</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">The aim of this report is to outline the details of the incidents for JMEC
with assessments and recommendations.

1.4  Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The ongoing violence in the area during these incidents has so

far made it impossible for the MVT based in the UNMISS compound to visit the

scene of the fighting;</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">however, the MVT was able to witness some of the

fighting from the UNMISS base.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">They have also spoken with Government

Forces commanders and obtained information from local sources and UNMISS.

</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">The MVT has tried to get information from SPLM/A-IO commanders but with

only limited success.

2.0  Fighting in Nassir
2.1 22-26 November 2016:</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">On 22 November a helicopter arrived in Nassir with supplies for the
Government Forces garrison.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">It was accompanied by two helicopter
gunships which bombarded SPLM/A-IO positions south of the Sobat River.
</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">This led to a heavy exchange of fire.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">Further firing was heard later that day
to the west of Nassir.

</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">•</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">On 25 November there was a significant clash between Government and
SPLM/A-IO forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">This apparently happened because the Government
Forces took 63 cattle from civilians who crossed the Sobat in the area of
Nassir town.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">In the afternoon about 100 armed civilians and SPLM/A-IO
soldiers were seen advancing towards Nassir from the east before
withdrawing.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">Clashes continued on 26 November.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">The Government Forces
commander in Nassir confirmed that his troops had taken the cattle.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">The
MVT and UNMISS personnel tried to negotiate the return of the cattle by
speaking with both parties, but without success.

2.29-22 December 2016:</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">On  December there was an exchange of fire between Government and
SPLM/A-IO forces to the west of Nassir town.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">The Government Forces
commander claimed that the SPLM/A-IO had initiated the engagement by
Opening fire on his positions from south of the Sobat River.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">There were further exchanges of fire on 22 December to the east of Nassir,
when SPLM/A-IO forces allegedly opened fire on Government Forces
soldiers who had gone fishing.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">At a meeting the next day the Government
Forces commander agreed that his soldiers would no longer fish in that
area.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">The cattle impounded by the Government Forces had still not been
released at this time.

2.3 26 December 2016 —  January 2017:</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">On 26 December there were heavy clashes between Government and
SPLM/A-IO forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">About 100 Government soldiers and three vehicles
were seen advancing from their base, past the UNMISS base and towards
the SPLM/A-IO positions in Kedbeck to the east of Nassir.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">Heavy fighting
was heard.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">There was renewed fighting on  January.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">Government Forces again
attacked and this time took Kedbeck.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">They also attacked northeast towards
Kuatt, north towards Haimajak and reportedly east towards Ebone.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">On 
January two Government Forces helicopter gunships from Malakal
bombarded SPLM/A-IO positions south of the Sobat.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">An aeroplane was
also seen dropping bombs.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Heavy fighting was heard.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">On  January the Government Forces commander in Nassir attended a
meeting with the MVT and UNMISS where he confirmed that Government
Forces had crossed the Sobat to attack SPLM/A-IO positions at Nordeng
and Kuetrengke.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">He stated that the SPLM/A-IO had withdrawn and these
positions were now under control of the Government.

2.4  Since the events described above there have been sporadic clashes in the
Kedbeck area, but so far as the MVT has been able to discover those areas
taken by the Government remain in Government hands and the SPLM/A-IO has
withdrawn.

3.0  Assessment

3.1  CTSAMM has in the past recommended many times that there should be some
sort of local agreement in the Nassir area to allow the Parties to coexist
peacefully until a political solution is implemented.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">There has been no
agreement, and since the events of July 2016 tensions have increased.

3.2| CTSAMM understands that the close proximity of SPLM/A-IO forces are seen
as a threat by the Government Forces in Nassir, and it is probable that on
several occasions it was the SPLM/A-IO which initiated some of the clashes
that took place.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">However, Government Forces actions from 26 December to 
January show all the characteristics of planned offensive operations, especially
given the deployment of valuable and expensive air assets and the deliberate
crossing of the Sobat River.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">The Government Forces commander himself
clearly stated that his troops had crossed the river to take SPLM/A-IO positions.

3.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">It is the opinion of CTSAMM that by mounting deliberate offensive operations
against SPLM/A-IO forces around Nassir, Government Forces were in clear
violation of the PCTSA.

4.0  Conclusion

4.1  It is the clear opinion of CTSAMM that in Nassir on several occasions between
22 November 2016 and  January 2017 Government Forces violated Article 1.0 
of the PCTSA, particularly:</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">Article 1.1  of the COHA:</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">“The Parties hereby agree to cease all military
actions aimed at each other....”

5.0  Recommendations and observations

5.1  CTSAMM recommends that a strong message be sent to the Parties that
offensive operations of this nature must stop if the peace process is to proceed.
</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">The blatant employment of helicopter gunships and air-dropped bombs
provides highly-visible evidence that in the Nassir area at least the Government
is ignoring the provisions of the PCTSA.

5.2  To date the MVT has been unable to get clear evidence of any civilian
casualties.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">There are few civilians in the area, but the use of aerial
bombardment must put their lives civilians at considerable risk.
