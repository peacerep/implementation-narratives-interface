EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report covers violations of the R-ARCSS which occurred in June 2020 as a
result of fighting in the Namutina area of Western Equatoria.

Allegations were made to CTSAMVM that SPLM/A-IO forces under the command of
Brigadier General Santo Ali were harassing civilians in the NAMATINA area.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">On 15
June 2020 soldiers from SPLM/A-IO under his command entered TAMBURA and
became involved in a clash with NSS scidiers.

</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">In subsequent operations conducted by NSS, SSPDF and armed youth from the
Zande community against the forces of Brigadier General Santo Ali the SPLM/A-IO
base at NABIAMA was burned.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">There were armed clashes between the two parties
which resulted in the death of over 20 civilians,  SPLA/IO soldiers  including
Brigadier General Santo Ali.

</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">The impact of the fighting was serious because over 5000 civilians were displaced
as they fled to safety creating humanitaiiai:</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">distress.

Multiple violations occurred ranging from armed clashes to failure to protect civilians.
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">Responsibility for the violations lies with the Government and SPLM/A-lO.

If both parties had adhered to the appropriate provisions of the R-ARCSS the fighting
and displacement of civilians could have been avoided.

FIGHTING AND PROTECTION OF CIVILIANS VIOLATIONS IN TAMBURA AREA
JUNE 2020

Introduction

1. Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">

a. The situation in the TAMBURA area of Western Equatoria State is complex.
</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">There have been long-running tensions between the Zande tribe which is the
majority within TAMBURA, and the Balanda tribe which is mainly to the north
of TAMBURA.

b. SPLM/A-IO  Brigade of Division 9B under the command of Brig Gen Santo
Ali has been based in NAMUTINA, which is about 55 Km North West of
TAMBURA.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">In March 2020 these forces moved to NABIAMA (about 15 Km
west of TAMBURA) because of the lack of mobile telephone network and
other resources such as food.

</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">c. Brig Gen Santo Ali was of the Balanda tribe as were most of his furces.

d. TAMBURA is held by the Government and garrisoned by 160 BN of 16 BDE
together with police and NSS forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The local Zande youth are referred to as
‘Arrow Boys’.

</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">•. On  April 2020 at a political rally in TAMBURA held by the former SPLM/A-
 </a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">Deputy Governor, Brig Santo Ali declared that he had changed allegiance
from the SPLM/A-IO to the SSPDF with all of his soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">However, after
three days he changed his mind and is reported to have reverted to the
SPLM/A-IO.

f. Western Equatoria State was without a Governor until the end of June 2020.
2. Incidents and allegations

a. On 15 June, CTSAMVM received a report from a source that forces
deployed by BG Santo Ali in Tambura town started shooting in air and
looting the market.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">SSPDF forces were said later to have deployed in the
town and repulsed BG Santo Ali forces.

b. Local authorities and traditional leaders in the TAMBURA area alleged
that after they moved to NABIAMA from NAMATINA in March 2020 the
SPLM/A-IO forces commanded by Brig Gen Santo Ali engaged in looting
and other criminal activities.

</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">c. On the night of 17/18 June 2920 Brig Gen Santo Ali was killed near
TAMBURA in an incident allegedly involving NSS forces, SSPDF and
armed Zande youth.

d.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">On 23 June 2020 CTSAMVM learned from UNMISS that fighting between
Government Forces and those of Brig Gen Santo Ali had led to the
displacement of over five  thousand civilians.  </a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">Representatives from
humanitarian organizations including WFP and UNHCR were deployed to
Tambura to assist the IDPs.

</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">•. On  September 2020 CTSAMVM received allegations from a number of
sources that tensions were high in the TAMBURA area and there was a
danger of fighting between the mainly Balanda SPLM/A-IO forces in
NAMUTINA, and the mainly Zande forces some of whom were under the
control of Maj General James Nando who changed allegiance from the
SPLM/A-IO to the SSPDF in Mzch 2020.

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">
a. The CTSAMVM MVT based in YAMBIO  conducted a  Long
Duration Patrol (LDP) to the area from 15 to 18 August 2020.
</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">During this patrol CTSAMVM:</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">

i. Visited DANGU, NAMUTINA and TAMBURA.

ii, Interviewed a total of 13 key witnesses including civil
administrators, traditional leaders and civilians (including a
former SPLM/A-IO soldier) in DANGU, NAMUTINA and
TAMBURA, SPLM/A-IO officers in NAMUTINA, the NSS
Director and SSPDF Battalion Commander in TAMBURA.

b. On 11 September 2020 CTSAMVM visited  TAMBURA and
interviewed local civil, military and security officers, local people
and traditional leaders.

</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">c. The standard of proof used by CTSAMVM to determine whether
there is sufficient evidence to verify that a Party is not in
compliance with the provisions of the Agreements is “reasonable
grounds to believe that the incident that is the subject of the
investigation occurred.”</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">This is in accordance with accepted
practice for monitoring mechanisms and humanitarian entities and
signifies that sufficient facts and evidence have been collected to
conclude that an event has occurred.

Findings
4.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">When the SPLM/A-IO  Brigade commanded by Brig Santo Ali first moved from
NAMUTINA to NABIAMA in March relations with the local community were good.
</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">However, over the following moriths they deteriorated.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">Local community leaders
and the civil authorities claimed the SPLM/A-IO soldiers engaged in looting, theft,
and assault against civilians:</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">the SPLM/A-IO claimed they were subject to
increasing levels of  harassment bv Zande  youth.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">The SPLM/A-IO told
CTSAMVM that they were short of food;</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">they denied looting but were unable to
say from where they obtained supplies.

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">Brigadier General Santo Ali was warned several times by the civil authorities and
the Paramount Chief about the activities of his soldiers, but he refused to meet
and discuss these issues.

6.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">On 15 June 2020 there was an incider.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">involving some SPLM/A-IO soldiers in the
market in TAMBURA.  </a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">According to the NSS and other Government authorities,
some SPLM/A-IO soldiers tried to arrest a Sudanese national which led to the
involvement of the NSS who chased the SPLM/A-IO soldiers away.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">According to
the SPLM/A-IO, soldiers sent to the market to obtain food were subject to an
unprovoked attack by NSS and Zande youth.

7. NSS, Zande youth and  SSPDF forces moved to  the SPLM/A-IO  camp at
NABIAMA, looted and burnt it.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">According to Government sources, the NSS were
chasing the SPLM/A-IO forces from TAMBURA when one of their NSS officers
was killed in an SPLM/A-IO ambush.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">The SPLM/A-IO had moved out from their
camp at NABIAMA by the time the NSS forces arrived.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">On 16 June 2020 Brig Gen Santo Ali moved back to the camp at NABIAMA which
had been destroyed by the Government Operation, with a small number of his
men, reportedly to meet with an UNM!SS delegation.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">This meeting never took
place.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">According to SPLM/A-IO officers who were with him he theri received a
call from Lt Gen Alfred Futiyo, the SPLM/A-IO Sector  commander, who told him
to move back to NAMUTINA in order to avoid any further conflict.  </a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Brig Gen
Santo Ali apparently replied that he could not as he had no food.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">That night Lt
Gen Alfred Futiyo again called Brig Gen Santo Ali and told him that it had been
decided that the Governorship of Western Equatoria State would go to the

SPLM/A-IO and that he was to “fight no more”.

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">On 17 June Brig Gen Santo Ali spent the day at NABIAMA.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">He was told by his
officers that he should move for security reasons, but that night he insisted on

moving towards TAMBURA to gather intelligence.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">When he and his men crossed
the Yuba River they were ambushed by NSS, Brig Gen Santo Ali died during the
night from injuries sustained in the amwush.

10. NSS, SSPDF and Zande youth pursued the SPLM/A-IO forces to BAANGARU in
an operation which went on to 23 June 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">During these operations  soldiers
and over 20 civilians lost their lives.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Over ,000 civilians were displaced.

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">The NSS commander in TAMBURA confirmed that NSS and SSPDF forces
carried out the operation against the  during which Brig Gen Santo Ali was
killed.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">The SSPDF commander refused to discuss the incident with CTSAMVM
describing it as a routine security operation.

12.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">CTSAMVM has reasonable grounds to believe that the Zande youth were armed
prior to the fighting against the SPLM/A-IO, and that some of them took part in
the operations together with NSS and SSPDF forces.

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">In the first week of August 2020 the Gc /ernor of Western Equatoria State, Lt Gen
Alfred Futiyo (previously SPLM/A-IO Sector  commander) visited TAMBURA
and did much to calm tensions between the Zande and Balanda.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">He also created
a Peace and Reconciliation Committee to address issues between the two tribes.

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">CTSAMVM found that the information they had received on  September 2020
(Para 2e above refers) about tensions in TAMBURA were greatly exaggerated.
</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">There were many rumours circulating which had led to people leaving the market
on  September, but there was nc  substantive information to  suggest any
significant changes to the security situation in the area.

Assessment

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">There are tribal tensions between the Zande and Balanda in the TAMBURA area,

and there is no doubt that these tensions contributed to the events of 15-23 June
2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">However, there were clashes between NSS/SSPDF forces and those of
the SPLM/A-IO which  included deliberate  Operations by the NSS/SSPDF
resulting in the death of an SPLM/A-IO officer, several SPLM/A-IO soldiers and a
number of civilians.

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">These incidents would not have happened if the SPLM/A-IO had remained where
they were in NAMUTINA.  </a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">By moving to NABIAMA they failed to comply with
those provisions of the R-ARCSS that prohibit redeployment and movement, and
which also oblige the Parties to inform CTSAMVM of any planned movement.

17.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">CTSAMVM has reasonable grounds to believe that SPLM/A-IO forces based in
NABIAMA under the command of BG Santo Ali did harass local civilians, and
there was some looting.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">The SPLM/A-IO had no regular supplies, and although
the local population did  give them some support this  ended after a while.
</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">Tensions rose, and these were stirred up by some Zande traditional leaders.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">By
harassing local people, the SPLM/A-IO failed to comply with those provisions of
the R-ARCSS concerning the treatment and protection of civilians.

18.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">There are conflicting accounts of what happened in TAMBURA market on 15
June 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">However, after that there were deliberate operations by ihe NSS and
SSPDF against the SPLM/A-IO which resulted in the looting and burning of the
SPLM/A-IO camp at NABIAMA, the killing of Brig Gen Santo Ali and several
SPLM/A-IO soldiers, the killing of a number of civilians and the displacement of
over ,000 people.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">By taking these actions the NSS and SSPDF failed to comply
with those provisions of the R-ARCSS which prohibit any hostile military actions.
</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">Because civilians were killed during these operations, the NSS/SSPDF and the
SPLM/A-IO failed in their obligations under the R-ARCSS to protect civilians.

19.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">Evidence from civilian sources provides reasonable grounds to believe that local
Zande youth were mobilised and involved in operations against the SPLM/A-IO in
violation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">Allegations that the youth were armed by NSS or
SSPDF cannot be substantiated.
20.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">The actions taken by the Governor of Western Equatoria State, Lt Gen Alfred
Futiyo, including his visit to TAMBURA in early August 2020 and his creation of a
Peace and Reconciliation Committee to address inter-tribal issues have done
much to reduce tensions in the area.

Conclusions

21.Redeployment and Movement of  Forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">By  moving their forces from
NAMUTINA to NABIAMA in March 2020, and by failing to inform CTSAMVM of
the move, the SPLM/A-IO acted in clear violation of prohibited actions outlined in
the R-ARCSS Article 2.1.10.0:</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">“....fedeployment and movement of forces except
for administrative and  logistical movements allowed under  COHA of 21
December 2017, which shall be reported to CTSAMVM prior to movernents.....”

22.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">Protection of Civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">By harassing civilians in the TAMBURA area the
SPLM/A-IO acted in clear violation of prohibited actions outlined in the R-ARCSS
Article 2.0.10.0:</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">“...acts of hostility, intimidation, violence or attacks against the
civilian population....” Because civilians were killed during these operations the
NSS/SSPDF and SPLM/A-IO also failed in their obligations under the R-ARCSS
to protect civilians, specifically Article 2.0.10.0.4:</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">“...protection of human rights of
civilians at all times to ensure safety...”

23.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">Hostile Military Actions.  </a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">By undertaking deliberate military operations against
SPLM/A-IO forces, the NSS and SSPDF acted in clear violation of the R-ARCSS

Article 2.0.10.0.2:</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">“....cessation of all hostile military actions....”.

24.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">Mobilisation of Forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">By mobilising the local Zande youth and permitting
them to take part in offensive operaiions the Government authorities acted in
violation of the R-ARRCS,  specifically Article 2.0.10.0  which refers to
mobilisation.

Observations and Recommendations

25.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">Inter-tribal tensions were most likely at the root of the issues which led to the
clashes of 15-23 June 2020.  </a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">However, signatory Parties of the R-ARCSS were
involved in armed clashes as a resuli and are therefore accountable for clear
violations of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">Had the Parties complied with the R-ARCSS these
incidents would not have occurred.

26.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">The lack of a Governor in Western ‘quatoria before and at the time of the
incidents might have been a contributory factor.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">Had there been strong and clear
government at state level the tensions in the TAMBURA area might have been
addressed before resulting in violence.

27.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">The incidents described in this report demonstrate a failure by the Government
and SPLM/A-IO to implement key provisions of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">The SPLM/A-IO
forces were stationed at NAMUTINA in a barracks not officially recognised as a
Cantonment Site as endorsed by the JMCC.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">The movement of this unit to
NABIAMA should have been notified to CTSAMVM through the JMCC.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">The
Government forces are also deployed to sites which are not recognised as
Cantonment Barracks by the JMCC.</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">All signatories to the R-ARCSS have an
obligation to implement the agreement in full.

28.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">It is the responsibility of the JDB to intervene and resolve any issues between
forces of the Parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">If the Government military and security forces in TAMBURA
were concerned about the actions of those SPLM/A-IO forces  under the
command of Brig Gen Santo Ali, a complaint should have been raised through
the chain of command and taken to JDB for resolution.  </a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">The unilateral action
taken by the NSS and SSPDF in TAMBURA against the SPLM/A-IO was
unnecessary and in clear and blatant violation of the R-AARCSS.

29.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">Recommendations.

a. IGAD and R-JMEC should take note of the violations committed in the
TAMBURA area in June 2020 and  require both the Government and
SPLM/A-IO to be held to account.

Q
b. IGAD and R-JMEC should work ‘:</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">08ely with the R-ARCSS to improve the
Capabilities and effectiveness of the R-ARCSS security mechanisms,
especially the JDB, JTSC and JMCC so that future clashes are either
prevented or more swiftly resolved.
