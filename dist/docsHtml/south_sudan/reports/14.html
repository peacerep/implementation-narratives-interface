REPORT BY 

H.E. FESTUS G. MOGAE  
CHAIRPERSON OF JMEC 

 

 
 

 
 

ON THE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 

AGREEMENT ON THE RESOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT IN THE 

REPUBLIC OF SOUTH SUDAN 

FOR THE PERIOD

<p><a id="1" name="1">This report is submitted pursuant to Chapter VII, Article 5 of the Agreement on 
the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (ARCSS) and covers 
the period November 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="2" name="2">

</a></p>
<p><a id="3" name="3">Overview on the Status of Implementation of the Agreement 

 

1.  </a></p>
<p><a id="4" name="4">The reconstituted Transitional Government of National Unity has, over the 
reporting period forged ahead with implementation of the ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="5" name="5">At the 
October, November and December JMEC plenary meetings, TGoNU presented 
the membership with progress reports outlining actions taken so far in 
implementing the peace agreement and in furthering the peace process 
generally, including reconstitution of key Transitional Security Arrangements 
mechanisms and approval of cantonment sites in greater Equatoria and Bahr el 
Ghazal.  

2.  </a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">The TGoNU progress reports enable an appreciation of the efforts and challenges 
government  faces  in  implementing  the  Peace  Agreement.  </a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">These  reports  also 
inform JMEC’s monitoring and evaluation reports as required under chapter VII 
of the ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">

 

3.  </a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">As detailed in this report, the humanitarian situation has deteriorated markedly 

and the security and economic situations remained precarious.  

4.  </a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">There  are  continuing  reports  of  violations  of  the  permanent  ceasefire  and  a 
spread of the conflict.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">The involvement of other armed groups not party to the 
ARCSS  further  complicated  the  environment  for 
implementation  of  the 
agreement.</a></p>

5.  </a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">The  conflict  has  in  recent  months  been  marked  by  the  targeting  of  civilians, 
reportedly based on ethnic background and characterised by killings, sexual and 
gender based violence, kidnapping and destruction of property.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">6.   </a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">The  solutions  to  the  problems  that  South  Sudan  faces  are  political  and  not 
military.  </a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">To  this  end  I  have  engaged  with  the  TGoNU,  IGAD,  the  AU-PSC,  the 
new  UN  Secretary  General,  the  UNSC  and  our  international  partners  in 
discussions and efforts to encourage an inclusive political process.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">7.  I  welcomed  the  announcement  by  H.E.  President  Salva  Kiir  Mayardit  in  mid 
December  2016  of  the  National  Dialogue  Initiative.  </a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">This  process  aimed  at 
reconciling  and  unifying  Southern  Sudanese  will  succeed  if  and  only  if  it  is 
genuinely inclusive.  </a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">A truly inclusive national dialogue would go a long way in 
mitigating  drivers  of  conflict.  </a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">It  will  also  provide  an  opportunity  to  engage  the 
former  parties  to  the  TGoNU  to  return  to  implementation  of  the  peace 
agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">

8.  </a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">The  involvement  of  traditional  leaders,  elders  and  chiefs  has  been  useful  in 
resolving  community  conflicts  in  South  Sudan  in  the  past.  </a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">I  was  therefore 
pleased to meet with over 650 chiefs from all the 64 ethnic communities of South 
Sudan  in  early  November  2016.  </a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">The  Chiefs  expressed  a  desire  to  be  more 
actively  engaged  in  the  peace  process  and  considered  themselves  as  effective 
agents for brokering and promoting inter communal understanding.</a></p>

Chapter  </a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">I  –  Transitional  Government  of  National  Unity  of  the  Republic  of 
South Sudan  

9.  </a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">The Transitional Government of National Unity (TGoNU) under the leadership of 
H.E  Salva  Kiir  Mayardit  and  General  Taban  Deng  Gai  have  demonstrated  their 
willingness  to  cooperate  and  forge  ahead  with  implementation  of  the  ARCSS. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">JMEC  welcomes  this  spirit  of  cooperation.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">   </a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">However,  JMEC  also  continues  to 
receive  sustained  challenges  and  reproach  from  Dr.  Riek  Machar  Teny  (former 
First Vice President) and the other estranged parties who were previously part of 
the TGoNU, challenging the credibility of the current Transitional Government of 
National Unity (TGoNU) and the legality of the present arrangement.   
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">10.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC) members, regional and 
international  partners  have  all  expressed  their  concern  with  regard  to  the 
inadequacy  of  representation  of  the  other  groups  in  the  current  Transitional 
Government  of  National  Unity  (TGoNU).  </a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">Without  genuine  inclusivity  that 
addresses  the  repercussions  of  the  July  events  and  other  problems,  there  is 
unlikely to be sustainable peace in South Sudan.

<p><a id="37" name="37">While  the  Transitional  National  Legislative  Assembly  (TNLA)  is  established  and 
commenced  business,  a  few  positions  remain  vacant.  </a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">These  positions  are 
assigned  to  a  section  of  the  Other  Political  Parties,  and  one  former  detainee. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">JMEC  has  submitted  a  list  of  the  appointees  in  the  absence  of  the  National 
Constitution  Amendment  Committee  to  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  South 
Sudan and await his endorsement.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">

12.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">The  National  Constitutional  Amendment  Committee  (NCAC)  now  has  a 
substantive  Chairperson  appointed  by  IGAD  and  endorsed  by  the  TGoNU.  </a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">The 
new  Chairman  Mr.  Gichira  Kibara,  a  Kenyan  Constitutional  Law  expert 
commenced  his  assignment  with  a  series  of  orientation  and  consultative 

4	

meetings.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">From December 12-13 the new Chairperson conducted a two-day visit 
to Juba to introduce himself and consult with JMEC and members of the NCAC.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">

 

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">The work of the NCAC is important to complete the incorporation of the ARCSS 
into  the  Transitional  Constitution  of  South  Sudan,  2011  in  accordance  with 
procedures outlined in Chapter 1 of the Agreement.

<p><a id="46" name="46">Chapter II – Permanent Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements  
 
Overview 
 
 

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">During the reporting period, the implementation of the ARCSS continued albeit in 
difficult  circumstances.  </a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">Security  in  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan  continued  to 
deteriorate  with  fighting  between  government,  opposition  and  other  armed 
groups  across  several  states  especially  the  Equatoria  and  Upper  Nile  regions. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">Armed  Groups  proliferated  as  did  inter-communal  clashes  between  pastoralist 
communities.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">   </a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Criminals  and  the  politically  disaffected  all  started  to  blend 
together.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">Generals allied to the two major opposition leaders, Dr. Riek Machar 
Teny and Dr. Lam Akol clashed in Upper Nile region.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">   

 

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">There  have  been  increasing  reports  of  targeted  and  revenge  killings,  sexual 
violence, torture and destruction of farmland and property being committed by 
uniformed forces;</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">the extent to which these can be attributed to forces aligned 
with  the  TGoNU,  Opposition  Groups  or  other  armed  groups  is  very  difficult  to 
prove.  </a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">Since  November  2016,  the  main  highways  from  Uganda  and  Kenya 
remain extremely dangerous due to the high number of ambushes, killings, and 
robberies.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">

Ceasefire Violations 

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">There  have  been  several  ceasefire  violations  since  November  2016.    </a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">The 
intensity of fighting between the SPLA-IG and SPLA-IO (Dr. Riek Machar Teny) 
from  25  -  31  January  in  the  Upper  Nile  region  is  a  matter  of  grave  concern. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">Unfortunately, verification of violations of the permanent ceasefire remains very 
difficult  due  to  the  split  of  SPLM/IO,  proliferation  of  unidentified  non-signatory 
armed  groups  who  do  not  fall  under  CTSAMM’s  verification  and  investigation 
operations  mandate.  </a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  there  has  not  been 
any  reported  fighting  between  SPLA-IO  forces  loyal  to  the  First  Vice  President 
Gen.Taban Deng Gai, and the SPLA-IG. 

</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">Status of Transitional Security Arrangements Mechanisms 

17.  </a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">The work within the Transitional Security Arrangements mechanisms such as the 
Joint Military Ceasefire Commission (JMCC), the Joint Operations Center (JOC), 
the  Joint  Integrated  Police-Management  Team  (JIP-MT)  and  the  Strategic 
Defence and Security Review Board (SDSRB) was adversely affected by the July 
events.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">However, these institutions continue to build operational capacity.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">The Joint Military and Ceasefire Commission 

18.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">The Joint Military and Ceasefire Commission (JMCC) has been meeting routinely 
with  their  main  focus  on  developing  and  implementing  their  Chapter  II 
responsibilities including cantonment of forces, National Architecture start up and 
other  security  related  activities.  </a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">The  National  Architecture,  which  includes  the 
Area  Joint  Military  Ceasefire  Committees  (AJMCCs),  and  the  Joint  Military 
Ceasefire Teams (JMCTs) are yet to be established due to lack of resources to 
support the formation of these JMCC sub-structures.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">The National Architecture is 
a  critical  mechanism  for  the  command,  control,  and  coordination  of  assembly, 
cantonment, and the unification of the former belligerent forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">This mechanism 

	

6	

was designed to work closely with CTSAMM Monitoring and Verification Teams 
deployed  throughout  the  country.  </a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">For  the  time  being,  joint  liaison  with  the 
principal parties is conducted  through the  CTSAMM Monitoring and Verification 
Teams deployed across the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72"> 

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">19.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">The JMCC is pressing forward with cantonment planning hosting two workshops 
and weekly coordination meetings.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">It has forwarded an initial budget for the first 
pilot cantonment site to the TGoNU for the President’s approval.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">The JMCC plans 
to conduct joint site surveys of the cantonment sites with CTSAMM with the goal 
of having the initial pilot cantonment site operational and functional by the end 
of  March  2017.  </a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">This  will  include  the  requirements  to  train  and  deploy  the 
National Architecture personnel and mechanisms.  

 

20.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">Lastly, the JMCC has turned over the chairmanship of the commission from the 

SPLM/IG to the SPLM/1O effective 9 February 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">

</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">The Joint Operations Center 

21.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">The  Joint  Operations  Center  (JOC),  which  had  been  established,  remains  non-
operational  due  to  lack  of  resources  including  facilities,  human  and  technical 
capacity.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">The reconstitution of the JOC remains a very urgent matter, given the 
fact that it will be the main coordination mechanism between the TGoNU security 
agencies, UNMISS and the future Regional Protection Force in Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">I therefore 
call  on  the  TGoNU  and  all  regional  and  international  partners  to  provide  the 
urgent support needed to reconstitute the JOC.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">The Joint Integrated Police - Management Team 

22.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">The  recently  appointed  JIP  Management  Team  is  coordinating  with  multiple 
agencies such as JMEC, UNDP, SSNPS, UNPOL, CTSAMM and various partners to 
refurbish the JIP training facility and mechanisms in Rajaf (30 Km outside Juba). 

	

7	

There  are  currently  1,200  trainees  both  male  and  female,  opposition  and 
government on site in Rajaf.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">In spite of the inadequate training facilities, the JIP-
MT intends to begin training by the end of February 2017.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring Mechanism  

23.  </a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">On 25 January 2017, CTSAMM held it first board meeting since June 2016.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">The 
SPLA-IO  (Gen.  Taban  Deng  Gai)  have  appointed  their  representatives  to  the 
Board,  an  issue  that  had  delayed  the  reconstitution  of  the  CTSAMM  Board. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">CTSAMM  has  reported  an  improvement  in  access  for  its  Monitoring  and 
Verification  Teams  (MVT’s)  and  has  recently  conducted  patrols  with  the  full 
support of TGoNU and UNMISS to areas in the Equatorias including Yei, Maridi 
and Mundri.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">Recently CTSAMM deployed an investigation team to Yei to verify 
and investigate an allegation of the burning of 1,900 houses in November 2016. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">In  addition,  CTSAMM  is  investigating  several  ceasefire  violations  a  majority  of 
which are in the Equatoria and Upper Nile regions.   

 

24.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">However, there exists severe restriction of freedom of movement in other areas 
due  to  the  activity  of  non-signatory  unidentified  armed  groups  in  CTSAMM’s 
operational  areas.  </a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">Whilst  CTSAMM  appreciates  the  administrative  and  Force 
Protection  assistance  it  receives  from  UNMISS,  the  absence  of  dedicated  force 
protection  units  that  can  deploy  in  a  timely  manner  hampers  its  operations. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">These  factors  impede  CTSAMM’s  ability  to  efficiently  deliver  on  critical  mission 
activities.  </a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">Another  significant  challenge  is  the  inability  to  contact  leaders  of 
armed/opposition  groups  in  the  Equatorias.  </a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">This  affects  CTSAMM’s  ability  to 
conduct investigations.   
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">25.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">In  addition,  the  absence  of  SPLA-IO  (Dr.  Riek  Machar)  in  the  monitoring  and 
verification  structures  has  severely  affected  CTSAMM’s  liaison  capacity  when 
ceasefire  violations  are  reported.  </a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">This  lack  of  liaison  is  hampering  CTSAMM’s 

	

8	

efforts  to  thoroughly  investigate  reported  violations  and  objectively  apportion 
blame to the culpable party. 

 

26.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">CTSAMM  has  increased  the  number  of  MVTs  from  11  to  14.  </a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">The  increase  has 
been  constituted  within  UNMISS  Temporary  Operating  Bases  and  has  utilized 
staff  from  existing  MVT’s  and  their  headquarters.  </a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">CTSAMM  continued  its 
verification  of  the  Transitional  Security  Arrangements  in  Juba  and  verified  the 
number and composition of police trainees awaiting training at the Rajaf Police 
Training Academy.  

 

27.  </a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">According to CTSAMM, the security situation is rapidly deteriorating as fighting 
continues  and  ethnic  tension  still  prevails  resulting  in  wide  scale  displacement 
especially  in  the  Equatoria  and  Upper  Nile  regions.  </a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">An  escalation  of  fighting 
between  opposition  forces  and  SPLA-IG  in  Upper  Nile  has  been  witnessed  in 
January  with  several  battles  fought  around  Malakal  and  Renk.  </a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">CTSAMM  also 
reported  incidents  of  killings,  burning  of  people  inside  houses,  rape,  arbitrary 
arrests and detention, looting, and general denial of movement for civilians.  
 

28.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">Security  in  Juba  has  significantly  improved  following  the  seizure  of  over  1,200 
weapons during a house to house search by the TGoNU security forces during 
the Christmas and new year period.  

	

29.</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">The TGoNU has authorized and is planning cantonment of SPLA-IO forces loyal 
to First Vice President Taban Deng Gai in the Equatoria region.</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">Once confirmed, 
CTSAMM will work closely with the JMCC in order to report on the locations.</a></p>

41.</a></p>
<p><a id="151" name="151">After a period of instability and rapidly increasing inflation from the beginning of 

2016, there are some hopeful signs on the economic front.</a></p>
<p><a id="152" name="152">

 

 

 

	

42.</a></p>
<p><a id="153" name="153">The first part of 2016 were marked by high and increasing inflation, a strong 

depreciation and a reduction in production, notably in the oil sector and in 
agriculture.</a></p>
<p><a id="154" name="154">Reduced production in agriculture is directly related to increased 
insecurity in rural areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="155" name="155">Insecurity has also negatively impacted oil production.  

43.</a></p>
<p><a id="156" name="156">A steep fall in oil production combined with the decline in the oil price led to a 
sharp decline in both revenues and inflow of foreign currency.</a></p>
<p><a id="157" name="157">This combined 
with a high level of government expenditures financed by borrowing from the 
Bank of South Sudan created excess demand which also spilled into the currency 
market.</a></p>
<p><a id="158" name="158">The impacts on inflation and the exchange rate were exacerbated by the 
disruptive impacts of the July violence.</a></p>
<p><a id="159" name="159"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="160" name="160">44.</a></p>
<p><a id="161" name="161">Indeed, monthly inflation reached 80 per cent in July 2016, well above the bench 

mark commonly used to delineate hyperinflation (50 per cent).</a></p>
<p><a id="162" name="162">There was fear 
that the economy was moving into a process of uncontrolled accelerating 
inflation.</a></p>
<p><a id="163" name="163">However, this did not happen.</a></p>
<p><a id="164" name="164">Inflation per month fell from 80 % in 

12	

July to 2% on average in the last quarter of 2016.</a></p>
<p><a id="165" name="165">There was also a less 
pronounced reduction in exchange rate depreciation towards the end of the year.  

45.</a></p>
<p><a id="166" name="166">The sharp reduction in inflation may in part reflect temporary factors.</a></p>
<p><a id="167" name="167">But these 
developments must be seen against policy reforms that are enacted as part of 
the 2016/17 budget.</a></p>
<p><a id="168" name="168">The budget signals a new direction in economic policy by 
setting ambitious ceilings for government spending and the deficit.</a></p>
<p><a id="169" name="169">Cash 
budgeting has been introduced as a mechanism to ensure that spending is kept 
in line with revenues.</a></p>
<p><a id="170" name="170">Data for budget outturn in the first quarter of the budget 
year indicate that actual spending was in line with what was budgeted. 
 

46.</a></p>
<p><a id="171" name="171">Despite strong curbs on spending, the approved budget still has a large deficit 
that has to be financed, either by increased borrowing, increasing revenues or 
cutting spending further.</a></p>
<p><a id="172" name="172">Oil prices have evolved more favourably than assumed 
in the fiscal budget.</a></p>
<p><a id="173" name="173">If this persists through the rest of the budget year, revenues 
will increase.</a></p>
<p><a id="174" name="174">This will ease the financing of the budget and have a positive 
impact on both the exchange rate and inflation.</a></p>
<p><a id="175" name="175">There is also a risk that 
increased revenues will strengthen pressures for increased spending.  

47.</a></p>
<p><a id="176" name="176">Implementing the stabilization program, which indeed is a massive undertaking, 

poses huge challenges for the Government in terms of capacity and expertise. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="177" name="177">Mobilisation of technical assistance is vital both in order to support the 
government’s stabilization program and to implement Chapter IV provisions.</a></p>

Observations and Recommendations 

 

59.</a></p>
<p><a id="218" name="218">The  prevailing  violence  in  different  parts  of  South  Sudan,  including  targeted 
killings of civilians, sexual violence and destruction of property particularly in the 
greater Equatoria, and renewed fighting in parts of Upper Nile and Unity States 
must be condemned by all.</a></p>
<p><a id="219" name="219">The cessation of hostilities must be observed as the 
current  state  of  insecurity  is  not  conducive  to  implementation  of  the  peace 
agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="220" name="220"> 

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="221" name="221">60.</a></p>
<p><a id="222" name="222">The Peace Agreement was undoubtedly compromised by the events of July 2016 
in Juba and the withdrawal of some agreement parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="223" name="223">As I have stated before, 
the solution to the conflict in South Sudan is political, not military.</a></p>
<p><a id="224" name="224">The ARCSS 
provides  the  most  viable  framework  through  which  to  prevent  further  armed 
conflict,  build  peace  and  reconciliation,  promote  accountability  in  governance, 
combat impunity, reform institutions and establish the rule of law in the Republic 
of South Sudan.  

61.  </a></p>
<p><a id="225" name="225">I commend the National Dialogue Initiative announced by President Kiir in mid 
December 2015 and urge inclusion of all parties and shades of opinion if it is to 
achieve its goal of national reconciliation, lasting peace and prosperity in South 
Sudan.  </a></p>
<p><a id="226" name="226">I appeal to the TGoNU, IGAD and the international community to take 
advantage of President Salva Kiir’s National Dialogue initiative and reach out to 
the estranged Parties and their followers.</a></p>
<p><a id="227" name="227">For dialogue to have real meaning and 
effect, it must include more than those who already agree with the Government 
and take account of all views and concerns.</a></p>
