Branch and met the officer in charge Mr Taban Oliver who reported that SPLIW/A-
 were holding in detention a civilian for an alleged offence which took place in

a.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">A lady called Vivian Semati who lives in Labat Yei alleged that her relative Arike
David has been in the custody of SPLM/A.IO since September 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">He was
reportedly detained after soldiers of SPLA- lO of Panyume Cantonment requested
and were given a lift on the truck of the said Arike David.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">The truck was carrying
timber logs and was involved in an accident during which two of the soldiers were
killed and a third soldier was injured, The Commander of the dead soldiers (Maj
Gen John Mabiei  SPLM/A-IO) of Panyume Cantonment site demanded that Arike
David pay the funeral expenses  amounting to 76 million Uganda  Shillings.
</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">According to Vivian Semati the expenses were paid by Arike David but to date (Sep
2019)</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">he remains in detention.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">

later investigations.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">All investigations were conducted with National Monitors,

b.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">The standard of proof used by CTSAMVM to determine whether there is sufficient
evidence to verify that a Party is not in compliance with the provisions of the
Agreements is “reasonable grounds to believe that the incident that is the subject
of the investigation occurred.”  </a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">This is in accordance with accepted practice for
monitoring mechanisms and humanitarian entities and signifies that sufficient facts

and evidence have been collected to conclude that an event has occurred.</a></p>

by customary law when the family of the deceased met with a Judge sent from
Juba.</a></p>

compound.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">He alerted Edward Taban and both men took their weapons and
departed their house.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">On leaving the house they saw armed men in the
compound and were ordered to drop their weapons and run.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">They ran into the
bush and heard gunshots after they left the compound.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">They went into the bush
where they spent the night.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">On 23 May 2019 they reported to Panyume police
station and explained what had happened.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">While at the station they learned
that an SPLM/A-IO soldier was killed in their compound the previous night.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">They
later established that SPLM/A-IO soldiers went to their compound, looted cattle
and burnt the house as well as killing their Ugandan neighbour.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">The two were
accused of murdering the SPLM/A-IO soldier who was reportedly killed on the
night of 22 May 2021 and were arrested and detained at Panyume police
Station.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">On 30 May 2019 the two were transferred to Mongoyo camp and
SPLM/A-IO custody.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">The two had been in detention since May 2019 and now
trial has been held.

</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">c. When CTSAMVM visited Panyume cantonment site on 22 August 2019 to
investigate the killing of an SPLM/A-IO soldier and a Ugandan civilian the
names of the victims were not confirmed.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">However, the details provided by the
Morobo County Commission (Hon Asio Moses John) indicate that the killings
took place during the same incident described by Lokisa Peter and Edward
Taban and Colonel Jeremiah Adok on 23 March 2021 to CTSAMVM.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">At the
time that CTSAMVM investigated the killings the SPLM/A-IO leadership at
Panyume denied any knowledge of such an incident, However, the Morobo
County Commissioner gave-a detailed account during which he related that on
the night of the incident SPLM/A-IO were conducting patrols around Panyume
and that there was gunfire.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">He acknowledged the death of a Ugandan civilian
and an SPLW/A-IO soldier.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">He stated the identity of the person or persons who
killed the SPLM/A-IO soldier was not known, He confirmed that two civilians
were arrested and taken to Panyume and were suspected to be the owners of
a weapon which was found at the scene of the killing.

</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">d. Colonel Jeremiah Adok acknowledged the details stated by Lokisa Peter and
Edwards Taban but maintains that they killed the soldier in the cattle compound.
</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">He confirmed that the two were not subjected to any trial because the family of
the deceased soldier had not reached out to the SPLM/A-IO Commanders to
discuss the case.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">Colonel Jeremiah Adok stated that all three detainees will be
held until either their families are compensated, or the family is compensated
by the SPLM/A-IO Commander in Chief and their release ordered,
, Legal Process,
a.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">The three civilians detained in Mongoyo have not been subject to any form of
legal process, no charges have been made.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">The detentions were authorised by
Maj Gen John Mabiei and Colonel Jeremiah Adok and have been declared
guilty.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">There is no evidence of a detailed investigation carried out by SPLM/A-
 of the incidents which led to the detentions.</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">The civilians detained provided
detailed accounts of the events and circumstances of their detentions but the
SPLM/A-IO accounts were extremely limited.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">Key witnesses to the vehicle
accident which killed two SPLM/A-lO Soldiers in May 2019 were released on
bail and have most likely returned to Uganda,

b.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">The civilians were  initially detained at  Panyume police station but  were
subsequently transferred to Mongoyo SPLM/A-IO base.</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">At the time of the
transfer the Panyume police station was still operational but it has since closed.
</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">The leadership in Mongoyo do not appear to have made any attempt to have
the detainees transferred into police custody at Morobo or Yei.

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">Compensation.</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">Arike David faces a demand for compensation amounting to 84
Million Ugandan Shillings and has remitted 19 Million Ugandan Shillings to Maj
Gen John Mabiei.</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">This was confirmed when CTSAMVM conducted interviews on
23 March 2021 but there was no evidence presented that the money paid had been
given to families of the three deceased soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">No demands for compensation
have so far been made on Lokisa Peter and Edward Taban yet Colonel Jeremiah
stated that the civilians will be detained until compensation is offered,

|
       .
11.Condition of the Detainees.</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">The detainees were observed to be wearing tattered
clothing, Arike David was described as emaciated.</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">None of the detainees reports
any physical mistreatment.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">All the detainees are psychologically traumatised by
the experience of being arrested and detained for such a long period of time without
trial or expectation of release.

</a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">Assessment

12.It is assessed that Arike David is  being illegally detained  by SPLM/A-IO at
Mongoyo, He has not been Subject to any judicial process and the crimes which
he is alleged to have committed have  not been investigated by appropriate
authorities.</a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">He has paid 18 Million Uganda Shillings in compensation to SPLM/A-
 </a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">but it is not clear why he is required to provide such.</a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">He was neither the driver
or owner of the vehicle, the soldiers willingly boarded the vehicle after requesting
a lift and while the deaths of two soldiers is a tragic loss the journey was undertaken
at their own risk.

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">It is assessed that Lokisa Peter and Edward Taban are being illegally detained by
SPLM/A-IO at Mongoyo, They have not been subject to any legal process and the
crimes which they are alleged to have committed have not been investigated by
appropriate authorities.</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">Itis assessed that all three civilian detainees have suffered psychological hardship
and trauma during their incarceration made worse by the fact that they have no
reason to believe they will be released.

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">It is assessed that SPLM/A-IO conducted very limited investigations at the time of
the arrest of all three civilians and that any new investigations will be severely
hampered by the lack of witnesses and the passage of time.</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">The long-term
detention of civilians exceeds the  authority of military commanders and
undermines confidence in the ability of the SPLM/A-IO to provide security,
