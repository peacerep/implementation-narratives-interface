Executive Summary
The situation in the MUNDRI area has been unstable since May 2015 with conflict
developing between local people, several armed groups and Government Forces.
</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">Recent allegations given to CTSAMM by SPLM/A-IO have been investigated by an MVT
deployed to the area.
</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">The results of the investigations were wide-raging.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">Much information was gathered,
although not all was either clear or corroborated.
</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">Sufficient evidence was gathered, however, for the JTC to assess that Government

VIOLATION IN WESTERN EQUATORIA STATE

1.0  Introduction

1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">There have been reports of unrest in the Mundi area going back to May 2015,
which resulted in an outbreak of clashes starting in September, involving
Government Forces and local armed groups some of whom claim allegiance
with the SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">The situation is complex.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">The perception of local people
in the area is that the conflict is driven by the actions of Dinka cattle keepers.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">In December 2015 CTSAMM deployed a Monitoring and Verification Team
(MVT) to Mundri in order to investigate specific allegations.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">However, the
MVT was denied freedom of Movement by Government Forces and had to
be withdrawn.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">Following further allegations raised by the SPLM/A-IO at the
end of December and given to CTSAMM in January, a further patrol was sent
to Mundri in order to investigate.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">Several of these allegations referred to the
killing and detention of civilians by Government Forces.

1.2  Allegations:</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">The allegations that the MVT investigated specific to this report
come from the SPLM/A-IlO letter ‘Ceasefire Violation Reports’ dated 31*
December 2015 and given to CTSAMM at the meeting of  January 2016.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">They
are quoted as follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">Allegation :</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">24" December 2015:</a></p>

<p><a id="29" name="29">25" December 2015:</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">The SPLA Juba soldiers went to Lozu
payam on 27 December in search of youth who were fighting under Maj. Gen.
Wesley Welebe.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">After they were resisted by the local community the SPLA-
Juba went back to Lui and killed  youths under detention.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">Their bodies
were burned and later thrown into river Okoo (a local dump site in Lui).

•</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">Allegation :</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">28" December 2015:</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">SPLA Juba forces established a new base
in Lanyi (between Jambo and Lui) in Mundri East County.</a></p>

1.3  Incidents:</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">Referring to the allegations outlined in paragraph 1.4, the MVT
identified the following incidents which they investigated and relate to the
allegations as follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">Between 20 December 2015 and 20 January 2016 a number of civilians were
killed the areas of MUNDRI, LUI and LANYI.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">(Allegations  and 2).

•</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">Government Forces are occupying LUI and LANYI, both of which are almost
empty of civilians (Allegation 3).

1.5  In addition to the allegations the MVT also found that a number of civilians have
been forcibly detained and remain in detention, and that civilians were living in
fear and many are still in hiding.

1.6  Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">The aim of this report is to outline the details of the incidents and
investigations for the members of CTSAMM with assessments and
recommendations.

1.7  Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">An MVT deployed to the Mundri area from 27 January to  February 2015
with the aim of investigating various allegations outlined above, several of
which involved claims that civilians had been killed or detained.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">The situation in the area is complex, with several armed groups (with various
allegiances) operating as well as Government Forces.  </a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">Although the MVT was
primarily focused on allegations given by the SPLM/A-IO and implicating
Government Forces, it was apparent that there are allegations concerning the
activities of other armed groups.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">Complaints were received by the MVT from
Government Forces and also from civilians which will require further
investigation.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">The MVT interviewed members of Government Forces, UNMISS, civilians,
including those who had fled into the bush or taken refuge in the POC site;</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">
church, community and youth leaders.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">They also witnessed at first hand
villages which were empty or nearly empty because the people were scared
and had fled to the bush.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">The MVT received a great deal of information, some of which was

Ne
CEASEFIRE AND TRANSITIONAL SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS MONITORING MECHANISM
(CTSAMM)
corroborated and some of which was not.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">There was much contradictory
information, and also much that was vague.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">This report contains summaries
of sample incidents which the JTC is confident to report as having happened
beyond any reasonable doubt.

2.0  VIOLATIONS OF THE PCTSA DIRECTED AT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION

2.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">Occupation of villages by Government forces:</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">Government Forces established bases in LUI and LANYI in November 2015.
</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">The MVT visited these bases and can confirm they are there, but they could
find no evidence of the movement and random shooting described in the
allegation

•</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">The civilian population in the MUNDRI area is in a state of fear.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Many have
fled to the bush, and the MVT witnessed the villages of LANYI and LUI that
are almost completely empty of civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">According to local officials, about
66,000 people have been displaced.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">MUNDRI itself remains only partially
occupied with many citizens either hiding in the bush or in the POC camp
seeking the protection of UNMISS.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">Schools are empty, and indeed the girl's
secondary school in LUI is occupied by Government Forces soldiers.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">The usually-busy roads from MUNDRI to LANYI and MUNDRI to KOTOBI are
nearly empty of traffic.

</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">•</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">The MUNDRI clinic has been looted and left without any stock.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Generator
batteries had been taken and the facility was inoperable.

2.2  Killings:</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">The MVT received a lot of information about killings, much of which was
contradictory in terms of numbers and dates.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">However, it was possible to
determine beyond any reasonable doubt that the following did take place:</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">In the LUI/LANYI area on or about the 21 December 2015 there was an
outbreak of hostilities.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">During these hostilities a number of local people were
detained by Government Forces, and some were later killed.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">All the
evidence suggests that at least  young men were killed by Government
Forces in LUI on or about 24 December 2015.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">Government Forces claim
that they were attacked at LUI on this date.

2.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">Detention:</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">The MVT received information from a number of sources including a
several officials, traditional leaders and elders that between 12 to 20 young men

CEASEFIRE AND TRANSITIONAL SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS MONITORING MECHANISM
(CTSAMM)
remain in the custody of Government Forces in MUNDRI.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">This was denied by
the Government Forces commander, but based on the information available the
MVT assessed that there was sufficient credible evidence that Government
Forces have arrested and detained a number of people.

3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">

3.1  The complexity of the situation in the MUNDRI area makes investigation of
alleged violations of the PCTSA particularly difficult, especially as so many
civilians have fled to the bush and as a result finding witnesses is not easy.
</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">However, it is clear that many violations have taken place;</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">it is also clear that
there are several groups involved and the attribution of responsibility is not
always easy.

3.2  Despite the challenges of investigating allegations in the MUNDRI area, the JTC
is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to confirm that Government Forces
have not protected civilians as they are obliged to do under the agreements, but
have taken measures that are against both the spirit and word of the agreements
and are thereby in violation of the PCTSA.

4.0  Conclusion

4.1  It is the opinion of the JTC that Government Forces have violated Article 1.0  of
the PCTSA in the MUNDRI area, particularly:</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">Article 1.1.5:</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">Acts of hostility, intimidation, violence or attacks against the
civilian population......

5.0  Recommendations and observations:</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">

5.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">The actions of Government Forces in the MUNDRI area were in violation of the
PCTSA in that they have failed to protect civilians, and also Government Forces
have engaged in actions against the civilian population that are prohibited by the
PCTSA and COHA.

5.2  However, the JTC acknowledges that there is evidence from a variety of sources
to suggest that violations might have also been committed by other Parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">The
MVT received unsubstantiated allegations that Government Forces were
subjected to provocation.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">Whilst if true this in no way absolves Government
Forces from accountability for their actions, it does illustrate the complexity of the
situation and importance of resolving the underlying issues involved.

5.3| CTSAMM recommends that action be taken by all Parties to restore order in the
MUNDRI area so the civilian population has the confidence to return to their
homes and continue with their lives.
