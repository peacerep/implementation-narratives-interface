KILLING, LOOTING AND ARRESTS IN EASTERN EQUATORIA STATE
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Ikotos County is under the administration of the SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">There is an SSPDF
garrison in Ikotos.</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">The relationship between the SSPDF and the County
administration has been strained, with the SSPDF accusing members of the
SPLM/A-IO of belonging to NAS.
</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">On 17 July 2022 an SSPDF soldier was shot dead in the Tojuru area of the town
following an altercation.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">Soldiers from the SSPDF garrison then went into the town,
shot and killed two men and looted houses and shops.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">Several houses were burnt.
</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">The two men who were killed were dragged from their homes and shot in cold blood.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">Another man was injured.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">Civilians fled to NGO and religious compounds where they
took refuge until the following day.
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">On 18 July a unit from the Tiger Division was deployed to Ikotos to restore order.
</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">The Tiger Division soldiers stabilised the situation and made the SSPDF soldiers
return some of the goods they had looted.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">They stayed for  days.
</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">On 31 July 2022 the County Secretary of Ikotos County SPLM/A-IO (also the deputy
head of Ikotos Primary School) was arrested in Ikotos by SSPDF MI.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">He was
transferred to Torit and (as at 20 October 2022) remains in custody.
</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">On  September Brigadier Adonge SPLM/A-IO from Ikotos and another senior
SPLM/A-IO officer went to Torit to take part in the NUF graduation ceremony.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">They
were arrested by the SSPDF — apparently for being involved in the 17 July shooting
incident - and transferred to Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">These arrests are the subject of ongoing
investigations by CTSAMVM.
</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">By rampaging through Ikotos following the shooting of the SSPDF soldier on 17 July
2022, looting property and shooting two men to death the SSPDF company in Ikotos
not only acted in clear violation of the R-ARCSS, but also failed to comply with their
obligations under the R-ARCSS to protect civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">By arresting and holding a
civilian in military custody, the SSPDF also acted in violation of the R-ARCSS.
INTRODUCTION
1. Background

a. The security situation in the Ikotos area has been relatively calm.

b. The administration of Ikotos County is SPLM/A-IO, as agreed following the
signing of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">CTSAMVM had received information from multiple
sources to suggest there have been tensions between the SPLM/A-IO
civilian administration in Ikotos and the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">There is an SSPDF
Company in Ikotos from SSPDF  Division.

2. Allegations:</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">

a. On 19 July 2022 CTSAMVM received allegations from Maj Gen Gabriel
Odongo of Irube Cantonment Site (but resident in Ikotos) that on 17 July
2022 there had been an incident in Ikotos involving SSPDF troops shooting
local people and looting property.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">CTSAMVM made enquiries and
confirmed that there had been an incident, following which the SSPDF had
sent a detachment of the Tiger Division to restore order.

b. CTSAMVM later received allegations of the arrest by the SSPDF of:</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">

i. The SPLM/A-IO Ikotos County Secretary on 31 July 2022

ii.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">Brigadier Adong and other SPLW/A-IO personnel on  September 2022

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">Aim</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">:</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">The aim of this report is to present the findings of CTSAMVM investigations
into alleged or suspected violations of provisions of applicable agreements, to
attribute responsibility for breaches of the agreements, and to make
recommendations with regard to compliance actions that will help foster peace
and reconciliation.
4.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">

a. The investigations were undertaken with the full participation of National
Monitors.

b. The CTSAMVM Monitoring and Verification Team (MVT) based in Torit:</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">

i. Met with the County Commissioner of Ikotos County, Joseph Lokalong,
in Torit on 21 September 2021.

ii, Undertook a patrol to Ikotos from 26-30 September 2022 during which a
wide number of witnesses were interviewed including:</a></p>

<p><a id="48" name="48">Met with the recently-appointed Commander of  Division SSPDF in
Torit on  October 2022.

</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">c. The CTSAMVM MVT based in Juba visited Giyarda Military Prison on 
October 2022.

d. The standard of proof used by CTSAMVM to determine whether there is
sufficient evidence to verify that a Party is not in compliance with the
provisions of the Agreements is “reasonable grounds to believe that the
incident that is the subject of the investigation occurred.”</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">This is in
accordance with accepted practice for monitoring mechanisms and human-

rights- and humanitarian- entities and signifies that sufficient facts and
evidence have been collected to conclude that an event has occurred.

FINDINGS

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Tensions in lkotos:</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">

a. The administration of Ikotos County, has, since the signing of the R-ARCSS,
been with the SPLM/A-lIO.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">According to the County Commissioner,
relations between the governing SPLM/A-IO administration and the
SPLM/SSPDF are strained.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">Witnesses in Ikotos corroborated  this;</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">
members of civil organisations and local SPLM/A-IO members alleged they
were harassed and arrested by the SSPDF because they were SPLM/A-IO.

b. The County Commissioner alleged that the SSPDF accused SPLM/A-lO
members of being NAS;</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">again this was corroborated by witnesses in Ikotos.
</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">The Deputy Commander of the SSPDF Company based in Ikotos told
CTSAMVM that SPLM/A-IO forces under Brigadier Adonge had changed
their allegiance to NAS;</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">this allegation was repeated by the Police Inspector
in Ikotos.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">CTSAMVM could find no civilian witnesses to the presence of
NAS in Ikotos:</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">the Paramount Chief in Ikotos categorically stated there were
no NAS in the area, and accusations by the SSPDF that local SPLM/A-lO
members had changed allegiance to NAS were false.

6.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">Shooting incident on 17 July 2022:</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">At approximately 14.0  Hrs an SSPDF soldier
was shot dead in the Tojuru area of Ikotos town.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Shortly after this incident,
soldiers from the SSPDF company in the town went to the area where the
incident had taken place and started shooting at people.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">Two men — one a
Prisons Officer and one a member of the Wildlife service — were shot dead and
another man wounded.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">Civilians fled and took refuge in various religious and
NGO compounds or ran away to other locations.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">That night houses were looted
and several were burnt.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">The following day a detachment of the Tiger Division
arrived to stabilise the situation.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">CTSAMVM have been able to determine that:</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">

a. On the early afternoon of 17 July 2022 an SSPDF Corporal bicycled into the
Tojuru part of Ikotos.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">CTSAMVM has eye-witness testimony that he was
drinking with people and an argument arose during which he was shot
dead.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">CTSAMVM could find no eyewitnesses who identified the person
who shot him.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">The SSPDF in Ikotos claimed the man who shot him was a
member of the SPLM/A-IO who had defected to NAS with Brigadier Adonge;</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">
this allegation was repeated by the Police Inspector.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">Both the SSPDF and
Police inspector claimed that Brigadier Adonge had infiltrated armed men
into Ikotos and was responsible for the shooting.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">CTSAMVM could find no
civilian witnesses to substantiate this claim, and no evidence to suggest the
killing of the SSPDF soldier was politically motivated and anything other
than a criminal act.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">The County Commissioner stated that Brigadier Adonge
was in Ikotos at the time of the incident attending the funeral of his mother,
and that he advised him to leave once the SSPDF started shooting in the
town in order to avoid any kind of involvement.

b. Very soon after the SSPDF soldier was shot and killed, soldiers from the
SSPDF barracks in Ikotos went into the town and started shooting.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">The
County Commissioner (who was at the Catholic Church at the time) said he
called the SSPDF commander, Captain David Witwuar, and asked him to
stop but was told “this is what you have been looking for’.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">CTSAMVM has
eyewitness testimony of the killing of two men:</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">a group of about  SSPDF
soldiers went to the house of Corporal Andrew Lobwaga Lokomo of the
Wildlife Service, took him outside into the compound and shot him dead in
front of his wife and family.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">They then went to his brother Lomodong Mark’s
house — about 30 metres away — and shot him dead as well before leaving
the compound without saying anything.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">Lomodong Mark was a Prison
Warder posted to the prison in Torit but was in Ikotos visiting his family (this
was confirmed by the Director of Prisons in Ikotos).</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">Just before these
killings the same group of soldiers had met the brother of both of the
victims, Mario Othiongo, who was going to his home from church having
heard shooting.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">They were going to shoot him, but one of the soldiers
recognised him as a pastor and instead they told him to go to the Police

Station, he fetched his family and took refuge in the DOT compound.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">One
other person was shot and wounded, a watchman for the Red Cross who
was hit in both legs and transferred to Torit and then Juba for treatment.
</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">CTSAMVM was unable to determine the circumstances of his being shot.

</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">c. The Deputy Commander of the SSPDF Company in Ikotos, Lieutenant
Francis Aken, claimed that the two men killed had been caught in crossfire
between the SSPDF and the forces of Brigadier Adonge.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">CTSAMVM found
no evidence to suggest that any other forces were involved in the shooting,
and as stated above CTSAMVM has eyewitness testimony that the two men
had been killed deliberately and in cold blood.

d. Following the shooting incident most of the locals remained in religious or
NGO compounds for safety.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">That afternoon and night houses were looted
and several burnt by the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">CTSAMVM interviewed several people
including a shopkeeper and a returnee who reported  they had lost
household items and money.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">The shopkeeper had everything of value
taken.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">Many other houses were looted and at least  burnt.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">The houses of
Brigadier Adonge and  other SPLM/A-IO officers were raided and looted.

</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">•. On 18 July 2022 a detachment of the Tiger Division arrived to restore order.
</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">The County Commissioner called an emergency Security Committee
meeting at which the officer from the Tiger Division explained that his
mission was to protect civilians and return normalcy.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">The unit was in Ikotos
for two days, during which time some of the items looted by the SSPDF
were recovered and returned to their owners.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">The Tiger Division officer
addressed the public and encouraged them to return to their homes:</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">he also
said that soldiers should protect civilians not harass them.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">The County
Commissioner and other Ikotos residents interviewed by CTSAMVM said
that the Tiger Division unit acted very professionally and was effective in
restoring peace to the county.

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">The arrest of SPLM/A-IO Ikotos County Secretary:</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">

a. Mr Omui Velen, the SPLM/A-IO Ikotos County Secretary, was arrested by
the SSPDF in Ikotos on 31 July 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">This was reported to CTSAMVM by
the County Commissioner during their meeting with him on 21 September
2021 and confirmed by the County Executive Secretary, the SPLM/A-IO
Deputy County Chairperson and a teacher in Ikotos.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">The teacher was an
eyewitness to the arrest.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">The Deputy Commander of the SSPDF Company
in Ikotos denied any knowledge of the arrest.

b. The County Commissioner claimed that the SSPDF alleged that the
SPLM/A-IO County Secretary had admitted to being a member of NAS.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">He
asked to see the SPLM/A-IO County Secretary in detention at the SSPDF
barracks in Ikotos and did so on  August 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">He stated that the
SPLM/A-IO County Secretary looked as if he had been “tortured”.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">The
County Secretary stated he had not admitted to being a member of NAS,
but that he was County Secretary of the SPLM/A-IO and Deputy Head
Teacher of Ikotos Secondary School.

</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">c. The SPLM/A-IO County Secretary was transferred to  Division SSPDF in
Torit.</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">The County Commissioner claimed to have made representations to
the Governor to have him released, but according to the  County
Commissioner he is (at time of writing) still in custody and has been seen in
custody by his family.</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">When CTSAMVM met with the Commander of 
Division, Maj General Angon Chece, on  October 2022 he said he was
new to the Division and had no information about the SPLM/A-IO County
Secretary.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">The arrest of Brigadier Adonge and other SPLM/A-IO personnel on  September
2022:</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">
a. On  September 2022 CTSAMVM was informed that on  September Brig
Gen Adonge Jimmy Gabriel from SPLM/A-IO Irube Cantonment Site along
with  bodyguards was arrested in Torit.</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">He went to Torit to attend the
graduation of NUF Trainees;</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">CTSAMVM was told this by the County
Commissioner and several witnesses in Ikotos.</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">He was apparently accused
with involvement in the incident in Ikotos on 17 July 2022 (see paragraph 
above).

b. On 21 September 2022 Three relatives of Brigadier  Adongo visited
CTSAMVM in Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">They stated that  Brigadiers (the other being Brigadier
Santo Loyeren) had been arrested on  September in Torit with 
bodyguards.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">They informed CTSAMVM that they had been told by SSPDF 
Division that the prisoners had been moved to Giyarda Military Prison in
Juba on 15 September.

</a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">c. CTSAMVM was informed in Ikotos that when news of Brigadier Adongo’s
arrest became known, 44 of 80 SPLM/A-IO NUF trainees who were heading
to Torit from Ikotos for graduation decided to turn back, so  only 36
graduated on 19 September 2022.

d. CTSAMVM tried to visit Giyarda Military Prison but, despite the efforts of
National Monitors were unable to visit until  October 2022, when they met
with Lt Gen Thiik Hol, Commander Ground Forces, Maj Gen Jal Macith Jal,
Deputy Director for Administration and Col Deng  Mareng, Chief of
Administration, Ground Forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">They were given no information about the
arrested officers, but were asked whether or not they were still SPLM/A-IO
or whether they had been integrated.</a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">The matter was then taken up with
CTSAMVM Senior National Liaison Officers (SNLOs) who are pursuing the
matter with senior officers in order to confirm the whereabouts of Brigadiers
Adongo, Loyeren and their bodyguards.

ASSESSMENT
9.</a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">It is the assessment of CTSAMVM that there is no evidence that the killing of the
SSPDF soldier in Ikotos on 17 July 2022 was anything other than a criminal act.
</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">The response by the SSPDF Company based in Ikotos demonstrated ill-discipline
and was disproportionate.</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">There is no evidence that any other people other than
the SSPDF were involved in the shooting, and CTSAMVM has clear eyewitness
statements that the two men killed were shot by the SSPDF in cold blood.</a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">There
is no doubt that SSPDF soldiers looted civilian property and burnt several
houses.</a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">CTSAMVM interviewed a number of victims of looting, and were also told
that the Tiger Division unit which arrived on 18 July 2022 forced some SSPDF
soldiers to return stolen goods.

10.There is tension in Ikotos between the SPLM/A-IO administration and the
SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">Local community leaders and SPLM/A-IO members claim they are
harassed by the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">The SSPDF believe that elements of the SPLM/A-IO led
by Brigadier Adonge have changed allegiance to NAS, and that because
Brigadier Adonge was in Ikotos for the funeral of his mother he was responsible
for the killing of the SSPDF soldier.</a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">CTSAMVM found no evidence that this was
the case.

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">The SPLM/A-IO Ikotos County Secretary is a civilian.</a></p>
<p><a id="129" name="129">CTSAMVM has eyewitness
evidence that he was arrested and beaten by the SSPDF in Ikotos and is still
being held by the SSPDF in Torit (at time of writing).

12.</a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">Brigadiers Adonge and Loyeren travelled to Torit on  September 2022 in order
to take part in the planning of the NUF graduation parade scheduled for 19
September 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">When they arrived they reported to the military authorities and
were summarily arrested and, according to the latest information available to
CTSAMVM, remain in custody in Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">These arrests are not in the spirit of the
R-ARCSS and go against the principles that underpin the formation of the NUF.

CONCLUSIONS

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">CTSAMVM concludes that:</a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">

a. By summarily killing  men and looting civilian property in Ikotos on 17 July
2022 the SSPDF acted in clear violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically Article
2.0.10.0:</a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">“Acts of hostility, intimidation, violence or attacks against the
following:</a></p>
<p><a id="136" name="136">civilian population including IDPs.....”.</a></p>
<p><a id="137" name="137">The SSPDF also failed
with its obligations to protect civilians under Article:</a></p>
<p><a id="138" name="138">2.0.10.0.4:</a></p>
<p><a id="139" name="139">
“.....,protection of human rights of civilians at all times to ensure safety and
dignity of individuals and communities.”.

b. By arresting and detaining a civilian (Mr Omui Velen, the SPLM/A-IO Ikotos
County Secretary) - without any due process or involvement of the civilian
police — the SSPDF acted in clear violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically
Articles 2.0.10.0  and 2.0.10.0.4.

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

14.During the incident of 17 July 2022, the SSPDF unit in Ikotos displayed a
complete lack of discipline.</a></p>
<p><a id="140" name="140">Rather than acting to protect civilians it went on the
rampage, looting property and killing two men in cold blood.</a></p>
<p><a id="141" name="141">It is significant that
the military authorities thought it necessary to restore order by deploying a unit of
the Tiger Division, and that the Tiger Division forced soldiers from the SSPDF to
return some of the good stolen.</a></p>
<p><a id="142" name="142">CTSAMVM has no evidence to suggest those
soldiers guilty of crimes in Ikotos on 17 July 2022 are being held to account.
</a></p>
<p><a id="143" name="143">CTSAMVM recommends that the SSPDF unit in Ikotos is withdrawn, or at least
