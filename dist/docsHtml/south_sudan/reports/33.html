<p><a id="21" name="21">The MVT based in Nassir were able to monitor the situation closely through
established contacts.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">Repeated attempts to visit PAGAK (specifically on 28
July and  August) were thwarted by a refusal by the Parties to agree FSA's.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">However, the MVT was able to visit MATHIANG on  August 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">Meetings

2.0  Findings

2.1+The area has remained loyal to SPLA-IO (RM) throughout the current conflict.
</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">Major General Bol Ruach Rom - SPLA-IO (TD) — was appointed by the President
to be governor of what is known as Maiwut State, which was created in January
2017 when the Government increased the number of states from 28 to 32.
</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">Operations against SPLA-IO (RM) in the area have been conducted by SPLA-IG
together with SPLA-IO (TD).</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">It is apparent that these operations have been taking
place as a result of government policy.

2.2  On  July the MVT in Nassir attended a meeting with the governor of what is
known as Latjor State.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">He said that the whole area would be coming under
Government control, and Government-appointed governors have “been ordered
by the President to take up their posts’.

2.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">According to first-hand accounts Mathiang was taken by SPLA-IG forces on 
July, but was then re-occupied by SPLA-IO (RM) on 25 July.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">There were civilian
casualties during the fighting.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">The school, clinic and other buildings were looted
as the town changed hands.

2.4  On 27 July the MVT in Nassir received reports from multiple sources there was
fighting in Maiwut.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">On 28 July the spokesman of the SPLA-IO (TD) claimed that
Maiwut had fallen.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">This was reported in the press.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">Other reports suggested that
large numbers of civilians had fled the fighting.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">The SPLA-IG commander in
Nassir confirmed to the MVT that Maiwut had been taken and was now under
the control of SPLA-IG forces.

2.5  On  August SPLA-IG and SPLA-IO (TD) took Pagak.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">Since then have been
reports of fighting in the area, with reported attempts by SPLA-IO (RM) to re-take
the town.

2.6  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">

3.0‘It is apparent that military operations mounted by SPLA-IG and SPLA-IO (TD)
against the forces of SPLA-IO (RM) in what is known as Maiwut State were the
result of government policy.

3.1| The area has been under the control of SPLA-IO (RM) since the beginning of the
current conflict, with Pagak being their HQ.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">This military advance to and
occupation of strongholds under the clear and long-term control of the SPLA-IO
(RM) can only be seen as a blatant violation of the PCTSA.

4.0  Conclusion:</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">

4.1  It is the clear opinion of CTSAMM that by mounting deliberate offensive
operations with the aim of taking areas that had for a long time been under the
control of the SPLA-IO (RM), SPLA-IG together with SPLA-IO (TD) forces were
in clear violation of the PCTSA.

5.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">

5.1  There is supposed to be a ceasefires in place.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">By mounting such a deliberate
offensive operation the Government has completely ignored these agreements
by trying to achieve a political objective through the use of military force.

5.2  Weare supposed to be revitalising the peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">For this to happen there
must be a meaningful ceasefire with military forces frozen in place.

CTSAMM CONFIDENTIAL
5.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">The offensive has resulted in yet more mass displacement of civilians, with all
that this implies in terms of humanitarian issues, food insecurity and misery for
the citizens of South Sudan.
