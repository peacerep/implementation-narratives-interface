3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">

3.1      It is the opinion of CTSAMM that the attack took place as initially reported and

4.0  Conclusion:</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">

4.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">It is the opinion of CTSAMM that the attack which took place at MOLI was a
violation of the PCTSA by Opposition Forces, particularly:</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">

Article 1.0  of the COHA:</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">“The parties shall cease all military operations......”
Article 1.1.5  of the PCTSA:</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">“Acts of hostility, intimidation, violence or attacks
against the civilian population....”

5.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">

5.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">The JUBA to NIMULE road is the main supply route for people and goods into
and out of South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">It is the primary route for deliveries of Humanitarian Aid
into Juba for distribution to vulnerable communities throughout the country.
</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">SPLA-IO (RM) forces should respect the permanent ceasefire and allow full
access to all users.

5.2  Claims by the SPLA-IO (RM) that civilians were killed in the crossfire can be
discounted.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">SPLA-IO (RM) forces deliberately attacked a convoy which they
knew to include civilians, and civilian casualties were a direct result of their
actions.
