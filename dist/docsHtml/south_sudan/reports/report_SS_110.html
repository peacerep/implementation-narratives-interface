On the night of 15 December 2022, two SSPDF soldiers entered Attende IDP camp,
harassed civilians and then raped a young woman who they threatened with death if

<p><a id="16" name="16">The victim received medical treatment the following day and reported the rape to the
Chairman of the camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">As soon as the Commanding Officer of the nearby SSPDF
Air Defence unit heard about the incident, he arranged an identification parade and
the perpetrators were identified and arrested.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">They were moved to SSPDF 
Brigade HQ in Yei for incarceration and disciplinary action.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">They have admitted their
crime.
</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The rape committed by the two SSPDF soldiers was in clear violation of the R-

money and when she returned she found the soldiers had gone and her sister-in-
law — who lived with her - was not there.</a></p>

Component heard of the rape and immediately contacted the Chairman of the
Attende IDP camp and informed him he would cooperate fully in the matter.

2.0.10.0.5  and the ACOH articles  (1), (a),  (b) and (g).

</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

13.In March 2019 the SSPDF launched an Action Plan to address conflict-related
sexual violence.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">The first pillar of this Action Plan is Prevention, and the plan
itself goes into detail about what needs to be done to prevent acts of sexual
violence;</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">specific measures include training, sensitisation and orders.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">CTSAMVM
recommends that the SSPDF revisits this Action Plan and increases efforts to
prevent these incidents happening.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">The second pillar of the Action Plan is Accountability.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">CTSAMVM commends the
SSPDF for taking immediate action to identify the perpetrators and hold them to
account.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">CTSAMVM notes that in this case all the correct actions were taken.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">There have
in the past been delays in criminal proceedings by the Police in Yei caused by the
failure of the victim/survivors to return ‘Police Criminal Form ’, which has to be
signed by a doctor.
