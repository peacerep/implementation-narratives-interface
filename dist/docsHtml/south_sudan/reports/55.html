During October and November 2021 in Yambio County, SPLM/A-IO military forces
conducted what was termed a ‘mobilisation exercise’ to round up SPLM/A-IO
deserters.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">During the course of the activity forced recruitment took place after which
civilians were taken to the SPLM/A-IO camp at Li-Rangu and onwards to the Maridi
Training Centre.
</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">In the course of the recruitment a young girl was taken to Li -Rangu SPLM/A-IO
camp and forced to become a ‘wife’ of an officer.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">SPLM/A-IO took money from the
families of the recruited civilians in order to facilitate their release.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">Amongst the
individuals recruited by the SPLM/A-IO were child soldiers.
</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that:</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">
By recruiting civilians in the Yambio County area in October and November
2021, the SPLM/A-IO acted in violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically article
2.1.8.
</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">By abducting civilians and extorting money for their release the SPLM/A-IO
acted in violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically 2.2.10. 7.0.
</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">By abducting and placing a vulnerable person, a girl, into the hands of
SPLM/A-IO officers the SPLM/A-IO acted in violation of the R-ARCSS,
specifically 2.0.10.0.
</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">By recruiting civilians under the age of 18 the SPLM/A-lO acted in violation of
the R-ARCSS, specifically 2.0.10.0.
</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">Throughout the investigation the SPLM/A-IO provided complete access to
CTSAMVM and co-operated in every possible way.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The co-operation demonstrated
by SPLM/A-IO Div 9B should be used as a model for all parties when CTSAMVM
conduct investigations of serious allegations.

RECRUITMENT IN WESTERN EQUATORIA STATE
Introduction
1. Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">

a. SPLM/A-IO forces in Western Equatoria State (WES) are under SPLM/A-IO
Sector 6.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">The Sector HQ is situated in Li-Rangu Payam, Yambio County,
about 23 km north of Yambio town.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">The Sector Commander is Lt Gen Alfred
Futuyo who is also the Governor of Western Equatoria State and deputised
by Maj Gen John Martin Sunday.

b. SPLM/A-IO Division 9B also has its HQ in Li-Rangu Payam.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">It is
commanded by Maj Gen Simon Samuel Ali.

</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">c. In October 2021 the County Commissioner of Yambio County was informed by
the SPLM/A-IO that they intended to collect soldiers who had “deserted”
Cantonment Sites and were living amongst the civilian population.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">This move
was welcomed by the County Commissioner because some of these SPLM/A-
 soldiers were allegedly becoming involved in criminal activities and causing
problems.

2. Allegations:</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">

a. On  November 2021 the Deputy Governor of Western Equatoria State, Dr
Kennedy Goaniko, informed CTSAMVM that his office had received several
complaints of abductions and forced recruiting of youths by SPLM/A-IO Division
9B in Li-Rangu.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">He said that the Yambio County Commissioner could provide
more details.

b. Later on the same day —  November 2021 — CTSAMVM was approached by a
civilian from a village  Km north of Yambio who alleged that on 27 October 2021
his 17year-old nephew had been forcefully recruited by soldiers he suspected to

fy
be SPLM/A-IO from Li-Rangu.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">He went on to say that his nephew called him on 

November and declared he was in Maridi Training Centre.

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">Aim</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">:</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">The aim of this report is to present the findings of CTSAMVM investigations
into alleged or suspected violations of provisions of applicable agreements, to
attribute responsibility for breaches  of the agreements, and to  make
recommendations with regard to compliance actions that will help foster peace and
reconciliation.

<p><a id="149" name="149">Maj Gen Simon Ali Solomon SPLM/A-IO refuted the claims of recruitment
and insisted the SPLM/A-IO were just “mobilising their soldiers who had
deserted from their Cantonment Sites”.

iv.</a></p>
<p><a id="150" name="150">The State Security Committee agreed that all forms of recruitment should
Stop forthwith.</a></p>
<p><a id="151" name="151">It was also agreed that SPLM/A-IO would be facilitated to
publicise their “mobilisation exercise” through the FM radio station.</a></p>
<p><a id="152" name="152">The
SPLM/A-IO were also advised to engage local and religious leaders.

v. The committee agreed that complaints of forceful recruitment should be
made to the Yambio County Commissioner, who would share them with
CTSAMVM.</a></p>
<p><a id="153" name="153">Further the SPLM/A-IO should liaise with organised security
forces to address the issue of armed soldiers hiding in communities.

<p><a id="154" name="154">Maridi Training Centre:</a></p>
<p><a id="155" name="155"> CTSAMVM visited Maridi Training Centre on  December
2021 and met with the Acting Chief Instructor, Brig Gen Justin Atari and the Chief
Administrator Col John Agaar Anyan.</a></p>
<p><a id="156" name="156">In answer to CTSAMVWM’s questions they
stated that:</a></p>
<p><a id="157" name="157">

a. On 30 October 2021 a total of 95 soldiers arrived at the Training Centre, aboard
SPLM/A-IO vehicles from Li-Rangu.</a></p>
<p><a id="158" name="158">The departure order from Ri-Rangu
indicated 117, the training centre staff believe that 22 must have “escaped” on
the way.

b. Of the 95 who arrived on the trucks, only 86 were taken onto the training
strength at Maridi.</a></p>
<p><a id="159" name="159">Five Passengers were part of organised forces based in
Juba and were in transit.</a></p>
<p><a id="160" name="160">Two of the personnel who were taken to Maridi
Training Centre were respectively from Prisons and Wildlife service based in
Yambio county and had been abducted by the SPLM/A-IO on the journey to
Maridi.</a></p>
<p><a id="161" name="161">They were issued with departure orders and released back to Yambio
County.

</a></p>
<p><a id="162" name="162">c. Upon arrival at the Training Centre, all the soldiers’ bio-data were taken,
including their age, level of civilian education and military training at the
cantonment site.</a></p>
<p><a id="163" name="163">The ages ranged from 17 to 40 years old, there were three
17 year-old personnel registered.

d. With reference to the Statements given by the  young men who claimed to
have been forcibly recruited and escaped from Maridi Training Centre (see
Paragraphs 7c), and the name of the nephew given to CTSAMVM on 
November 2021 (see Paragraph 2a), Brig Gen Justin Atari denied that any of
these men had arrived at the Training Centre.</a></p>
<p><a id="164" name="164">He presented CTSAMVM the
list of arrivals which did not include their names.

11.SPLM/A-IO Division 9B:</a></p>
<p><a id="165" name="165">On  December 2021 CTSAMVM visited Li-Rangu and
met with Maj Gen Simon Samuel Ali Solomon, commander of SPLA-IO Div 9B,
along with his Deputy Brig Gen Daniel Abiuda and other senior SPLA-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="166" name="166">Maj Gen

Simon Samuel Ali Solomon said that:</a></p>
<p><a id="167" name="167">

11        "
a. He denied that there had been any recruitment conducted by SPLM/A-IO
Division 9B.

b. The SPLM/A-IO were granted authority to mobilise their deserters who were
living mainly in Yambio County.</a></p>
<p><a id="168" name="168">Some of the soldiers had turned into criminals
and were terrorising residents.

</a></p>
<p><a id="169" name="169">c. The mobilisation exercise was stopped on 31 October 2021, and challenged
the MVT to bring any who claim to have been forcefully recruited.

d. He admitted that the release orders which were issued to some victims were
from SPLM/A-IO Div 9B Headquarters, and that some of his officers might have
extorted money from victim's families but this was without his knowledge.

</a></p>
<p><a id="170" name="170">•. CTSAMVM was not shown the list of those sent to Maridi Training Centre on
28 October 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="171" name="171">Maj General Simon insisted it would be the same as that
shown to CTSAMVM at the Training Centre.

12.</a></p>
<p><a id="172" name="172">The Governor:</a></p>
<p><a id="173" name="173">CTSAMVM met the Governor of Western Equatoria State, Hon.

</a></p>
<p><a id="174" name="174">Alfred Futiyo, on  December 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="175" name="175">He stated that:</a></p>
<p><a id="176" name="176">

a. There was no forceful recruitment in Yambio County, but only mobilisation of
SPLM/A-IO deserters, and the exercise was stopped before his recent visit to
Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="177" name="177">He accused the MVT of biased reporting.

b. The information given at the State Security Meeting by the Deputy Governor
that he had ordered the release of 60 civilians who had been illegally arrested
was not true.</a></p>
<p><a id="178" name="178">He said he was aware that 120 soldiers had been taken to Maridi
Training Centre, and that another 120 had remained in the Cantonment Sites.

Assessment
13.</a></p>
<p><a id="179" name="179">Forcible recruitment:</a></p>
<p><a id="180" name="180">The mobilisation conducted by SPLM/A-IO Division 6B of
Sector  based in Ri-Rangu was intended to round up SPLM/A-IO deserters.
</a></p>
<p><a id="181" name="181">However, the activity also resulted in forcible recruitment in the Yambio County
12       M
area in October and November 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="182" name="182">This is evidenced by victim statements and
by information given by citizens and local authorities/traditional leaders.</a></p>
<p><a id="183" name="183">Further
evidence is provided by the Acting Chief Instructor of Maridi Training Centre who
Said he had to release two members of fire and wildlife services who had been
“abducted on the way [to the Training Centre]”.</a></p>
<p><a id="184" name="184">In addition, CTSAMVM identified
two other individuals who were recruited but subsequently released, one of whom
was released after his family paid money to SPLM/A-IO Div 9B.

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="185" name="185">Scale of Recruitment.  </a></p>
<p><a id="186" name="186">Allegations were made that there was large scale forced
recruitment underway in Yambio County.</a></p>
<p><a id="187" name="187">CTSAMVM is not able to verify the scale
of recruitment, there are  conflicting accounts on the numbers  involved.</a></p>
<p><a id="188" name="188">The
statement made by the Deputy Governor at the State Security Committee meeting
that 60 forcefully recruited civilians had been taken to Li-Rangu could not be
substantiated.</a></p>
<p><a id="189" name="189">However CTSAMVM   conducted extensive  engagements with
Boma chiefs, village headmen, and youth leaders and it is assessed that the
recruitment was greater than the Specified cases outlined in Para 13.

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="190" name="190">Duration of recruitment:</a></p>
<p><a id="191" name="191">The “mobilisation exercise” carried out by the SPLM/A-IO
did not finish at the end of October as claimed by the commander of SPLM/A-IO
Division 9B. This is evidenced by victim and witness statements, and also by the
fact that the release letters held by CTSAMVM are dated 20 and 22 November.

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="192" name="192">Extortion:</a></p>
<p><a id="193" name="193">The SPLM/A-IO has been extorting money from civilians abducted in
Yambio County.</a></p>
<p><a id="194" name="194">This is evidenced by statements made by witnesses and victims,
and also by the statement by Maj Gen Simon Samuel Ali Solomon, who admitted
that “some of his officers might have extorted money from victim’s families”.

17.Fear:</a></p>
<p><a id="195" name="195">People in Yambio County are scared of being forcibly recruited.</a></p>
<p><a id="196" name="196">This is
evidenced not only by statements recorded by CTSAMVM, but also CTSAMVM's
observations on the ground.

18.</a></p>
<p><a id="197" name="197">SGBV:</a></p>
<p><a id="198" name="198">The case of the young girl allegedly forcibly taken to and held at Ri-Rangu
(paragraphs 7a) is a strong indicator of SGBV, in particular forced marriage.</a></p>
<p><a id="199" name="199">The
evidence for this is that she clearly said that she had been given as a “wife” to an
SPLM/A-IO officer.</a></p>
<p><a id="200" name="200">It is of concern that, according to her statement, she was
abducted along with two other girls.</a></p>
<p><a id="201" name="201">The case of the 15 year-old girl at Maridi
Training Centre (paragraph 8) is also of concern.

19.</a></p>
<p><a id="202" name="202">Underage trainees at Maridi Training Centre:</a></p>
<p><a id="203" name="203">The Acting Chief Instructor at Maridi
Training Centre freely admitted that  of the SPLM/A-IO trainees were 17 years
old.

Conclusions

20.CTSAMVM concludes that
a. By forcefully recruiting civilians, including minors, in the Yambio County area

in October and November 2021, the SPLM/A-IO acted in violation of the R-
ARCSS, specifically articles 2.0.8, 2.1.10.0  and 2.0.10.0.

b. By abducting civilians and extorting money for their release the SPLM/A-IO
acted in violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically 2.0.10. 7.0.

</a></p>
<p><a id="204" name="204">c. By abducting and placing a vulnerable female minor into the hands of an
SPLM/A-lO officer in a form of forced marriage the SPLM/A-IO acted in
violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically 2.0.10.0.

Observations and Recommendations

21.</a></p>
<p><a id="205" name="205">General:</a></p>
<p><a id="206" name="206">It is apparent that an agreed exercise by the SPLM/A-IO to “mobilise”
“deserters” in order to remove them from communities and return them to
Cantonment Sites, turned into forced recruitment of civilians who had no military
training and had not been in the SPLM/A-IO.

<p><a id="213" name="213">He reported
there were further civilians at Maridi Training Centre who were being held
against their will.</a></p>
<p><a id="214" name="214">Note:</a></p>
<p><a id="215" name="215">CTSAMVM has the name of the escapee and will follow
up.

23.</a></p>
<p><a id="216" name="216">Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="217" name="217">CTSAMVM recommends that:</a></p>
<p><a id="218" name="218">

a. Action is taken by JDB to Stop recruitment throughout the country.

b. The SPLM/A-IO takes the necessary measures to instil discipline in Division
9b, and ensures that those guilty of recruitment are held accountable.

</a></p>
<p><a id="219" name="219">c. That the SPLM/A-IO investigates the case of the young girl allegedly given as
a “wife” to an officer at Li-Rangu (paragraph 7a).

raised over recruitment and for its pro-active stance to stop the recruitment and
mobilisation.

<p><a id="221" name="221">The investigation into the circumstances of recruitment in Yambio County was
complex and covered a number of  sensitive areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="222" name="222">Throughout the
investigation state officials and the leadership of SPLMA/IO Div 9B and the
Maridi Training Centre cooperated fully with CTSAMVM.</a></p>
<p><a id="223" name="223">Access to conduct
interviews and patrols was provided unconditionally, there were no denials of

access or information.</a></p>
<p><a id="224" name="224">CTSAMVM believes the behaviour and action of those
being investigated is a model of how parties should assist CTSAMVM in
fulfilling its mandate.</a></p>
<p><a id="225" name="225">It is regrettable that some other parties do not render the
same level of cooperation and access to CTSAMVM.         </a></p>
