|             9.</a></p>
<p><a id="138" name="138">The conflict in Torkech is assessed to have been caused by the presence of the
defected SPLM/A-IO officers (SSPDF aligned Kit-Gwang  forces) and their
                  competition for space.</a></p>
<p><a id="139" name="139">The SPLM/A-IO commanders are not comfortable with the
|                 presence of defectors in their area of control.</a></p>
<p><a id="140" name="140">Therefore, the coming back of the
defected officers to Torkech threatened the SPLM/A-IO command in the area
|                   hence the fighting on 05 Feb 2022.
10.</a></p>
<p><a id="141" name="141">The fighting in Torkech, between SPLM/A-IO and the defected officers constitute a
|                  violation of the R-ARCSS, articles 2.1.2  and 2.2.9  among others.
11.</a></p>
<p><a id="142" name="142">The presence of the former SPLM/A-IO Generals at Fouk (former SAF Barracks)
poses a threat to the security of Nasir County as the youth are still suspicious
|                     about their mission and activities in the area.
</a></p>
<p><a id="143" name="143">12.The SSPDF’s involvement and aiding of military mobilisation of the youth is a
violation of articles 3.0(•) of ACoH which prohibits all hostile military actions
|                including recruitment and enlistment, and R-ARCSS Articles 2.0.10.0  and
|                2.0.10.0  which prohibit acts of recruitment, mobilisation, redeployment and
movement of forces except for administrative and logistical movements.

<p><a id="145" name="145">The SSPDF soldiers suspected the armed youths who killed their colleague to be
|                   White Army youths from Nasir County, hence the killing of the civilians in revenge
which violates Article.</a></p>

<p><a id="148" name="148">SSPDF’s acceptance of Mr. Biiy Pal Malual, a young person of 16 years of age
to join their ranks was a violation of the R-ARCSS, Art.</a></p>

<p><a id="150" name="150">|             Conclusions
|             15.</a></p>
<p><a id="151" name="151">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that the SSPDF acted in violation of the ACoH,
|                articles 3.0(•) and R-ARCSS Articles 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0  and 2.0.10.0.1  by

involvement and aiding of military mobilisation of the youth including the
underage.
</a></p>
<p><a id="152" name="152">16.By killing two civilians in revenge, the SSPDF violated Article 2.0.9  of the
R-ARCSS.
</a></p>
<p><a id="153" name="153">Recommendations
17.</a></p>
<p><a id="154" name="154">The defected forces should always not be allowed to go in close proximity with
|                    the Party forces they defected from as this creates tension of intension to attack
|              them.</a></p>
<p><a id="155" name="155">The SSPDF should therefore withdraw and/or recall Maj Gen Tut Doar
|                and Maj. Gen. Chuol Buoth Nyuot from Nasir back to Juba or any other place
|               distant from SPLM/A-IO forces and/or their affiliates to restore  harmony
                     between the County Commissioner, SSPDF forces and the youth.
</a></p>
<p><a id="156" name="156">|
|
|           18.</a></p>
<p><a id="157" name="157">The SSPDF should desist from making arbitrary arrests of civilians and when
|                     they must, they should always handover the suspects to the police for custody
                  and investigation.
</a></p>
<p><a id="158" name="158">|
          19.</a></p>
<p><a id="159" name="159">The SPLM/A-IO Command in Ulang and Ulang County administration should
|              trace for Mr. Nhial Chuol Them along with his accomplices and hold them to
|                    account for the death of the SSPDF soldier.
</a></p>
<p><a id="160" name="160">|
|       20.</a></p>
<p><a id="161" name="161">The SSPDF should hold accountable the soldiers who killed the civilians.
</a></p>
<p><a id="162" name="162">|              However, the SSPDF should fast track and expedite the  process of
                    compensating the deceased civilians.
