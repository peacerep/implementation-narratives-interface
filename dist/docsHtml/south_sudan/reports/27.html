1.0  Introduction
1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">CTSAMM continues to monitor the security situation in South Sudan with
regard to the provisions of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (COHA).

•</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">The International Observers conduct routine patrols in the local vicinity of their
bases and more sustained patrols by air or vehicle to gather information and
conduct investigations where appropriate.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">MVTs have a network of contacts
to assist in gathering information which include, Civil Society Organisations,
state level government sources, media outlets, and through interaction with
civilians and soldiers in their areas of operation.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">MVTs also make use of locally contracted Community Liaison Officers who
provide early warning of potential fighting and other incidents.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">While the
gathering of information is carried out by an array of actors the MVT
International Observers are responsibility for verifying incidents and
conducting investigations and submitting reports.

1.2  Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">The purpose of this report is to summarise CTSAMM monitoring activity and

findings for the period August to September 2017.

2.0  Findings
2.1  Overall Security Assessment.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">While there is no recognised baseline for security,
the period can be characterised as being relatively quiet.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">Unfortunately, while
there may have been relatively few outbreaks of ceasefire-related violence this
.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">does not translate into a period of peace and stability.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">As of  October, there are
over 1.0  million IDPs (http:/Awww.unocha.org/south-sudan), and 1.1  million South

Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries, the majority of whom cite hunger

and insecurity as the reasons for relocation.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">Acts of criminality, intercommunal

“fighting and random attacks by unknown armed groups are increasing.
</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">Recruitment of male youth by the armed forces continues, and as ever the brunt
of the violence falls upon those vulnerable groups of women, children and the
elderly who have little recourse but to flee from the violence.

2.0  Upper Nile State.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">For the period covered in this report there were MVTs
operating in RENK, BUNJ, MELUT, MALAKAL and NASSIR.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">Planned patrols
were conducted to the locations shown below.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">Multiple attempts have been made
to conduct a joint patrol with UNMISS to PAGAK during September but to date
Flight Safety Assurance has not been granted.

<p><a id="34" name="34">it is hoped that at the CTSAMM meeting of 24 October we will be
able to present a report from a visit to PAGAK planned for today 20 October
.     2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">There has also been fighting in the ABUROK area in what is known

<p><a id="38" name="38">of civilians with large scale movement across the border into Ethiopia in the
vicinity of TELE where it is reported by MVT sources that there are 6000
refugees awaiting registration.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">The ABUROC fighting has resulted in the
temporary displacement of civilians and an unverified number of civilian
casualties.

<p><a id="41" name="41">•</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">Ceasefire Violations.

o MVT Bentiu conducted a patrol to Kuergweng on 23 Aug and confirmed
that on 18 Aug there were clashes between SPLA/SPLA-IO (TD) and
SPLA-IO (RM) units at Tor in what is known as Northern Liech State
(located between Tharwangyiela and Tomor).

    </a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">o MVTs Leer and Bentiu received reports from reliable sources that there
were clashes in the vicinity of GUIT on 24 Aug between SPLA and SPLA-
 (RM).

o Multiple sources reported violent clashes at PAKUR on  Sep. MVT Bentiu
visited PAKUR but needs to investigate this issue further before being
able to submit a report.

o In NHIALDHU established sources confirmed a substantial armed clash
on 18 Sep between SPLA-IO (RM) and SPLA/SPLA-IO (TD).</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">MVT Bentiu
and Leer have yet to conduct a detailed investigation as to the
circumstances of the violence and its consequences.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">They have so far
been unable to visit.

.     </a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">fighting in PAKUR there has been extensive civilian displacement and the
work of agencies delivering HA was severely disrupted.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">On  September, 35

staff relocated to Bentiu from surrounding areas southwest of Bentiu.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">It is
likely there were civilian casualties as a result of fighting in NHIALDHU, and
several NGOs also reportedly relocated on 18 September due to insecurity
caused by the warring Parties.

2.2  Jonglei State.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">There are  MVTs assigned to cover monitoring tasks in the
legacy Jonglei State.</a></p>

 women were raped by  SPLA soldiers on 05 September 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">The
allegation is under investigation along with other allegations of rape in areas
controlled by SPLA in FANGAK state.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">There are reports of parties using
Child Soldiers;</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">CTSAMM is hoping to provide a separate report on the issue

<p><a id="70" name="70">Ceasefire Violations.

o Western Equatoria.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">In early August there were reports of an armed
clash between SPLA-IO (RM) and SPA-IG in the vicinity of LANYI.
</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">Since then there have been small scale outbreaks of violence between
parties especially in the area of MUNDRI.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">MVT YAMBIO has not been
able to conduct full investigations of the allegations during the period
due to issues of roads and the availability of Force Protection but
patrols are planned in the near future.

      </a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">o Central Equatoria.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">There was a major clash at KAYA on 26 Aug

UNMISS to conduct a thorough investigation but road access
problems have resulted in major delays to patrol activity.

o Eastern Equatoria.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">There have been no major clashes between
parties in Eastern Equatoria but the recurring ambushes as reported
in CTSAMM Report number 49 have not abated.

stated earlier CTSAMM hopes to submit a report on this issue in due

.          </a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">course.

o In almost any clash between parties, civilians are involved with
innocent bystanders caught in crossfire and there are reports of people
being killed, wounded or abducted simply because they were in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

o There are multiple complaints from the farming community who
repeatedly have their freedom of movement impeded both on the way
to their fields and when returning to villages at the end of the day.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">Freedom of Movement.

o MVT YEl has not been able to conduct investigations due to road
access conditions caused by heavy rain.

o MVT YAMBIO has been unable to patrol MUNDRI because of road
conditions and insufficient UNMISS force protection resources.

o MVT AYOD has been unable to conduct air patrols to AYOD, OLD

“            FANGAK, WAAT, NEW FANGAK and AKOBO because UNMISS has
been unable to gain Flight Safety Assurances.

o MVT TORIT was impeded on 20 Sept 2017 from moving from Nimule
to Moli, Pageri, and Loa despite having a JVMM representative on the
patrol.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">The team were informed by the SPLA commanders in the area
of restrictions on their planned route and that the team was not allowed
to stop and meet with the local population.

3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">CTSAMM Monitoring indicates clearly that the provisions of the
PCTSA continue to be ignores by all Parties in large areas of the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">There
are signs of improvement in some areas, but overall the security situation
remains dire and the people of South Sudan continue to suffer as a result.

4.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">

4.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">Fighting between parties continue throughout large areas of the country.
</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">Combined with increased levels of intercommunal fighting and widespread
criminality the country continues to present a dire security situation.

4.2  All parties should commit to stopping the killing, wounding and threatening of
innocent civilians as ‘collateral damage’.

4.3  Freedom of movement:</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">Access is difficult enough due to road conditions and the
wet season, but the deliberate impediment of MVT Patrols in Upper Nile and
Eastern Equatoria by the Parties is particularly frustrating and unacceptable.

4.4  Lack of effective liaison with SPLA-IO (RM) remains a considerable obstacle to
CTSAMM operations and particularly to the effective investigation of PCTSA
violations.

4.5  The lack of sufficient UNMISS Force Protection resources is proving a significant
impediment to the operations of MVT’s.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">CTSAMM should be able to respond to
incidents in a timely manner, but too often it takes a long time to coordinate with
UNMISS whose resources are stretched.

4.6  Avwritten response to this report by SPLA members of CTSAMNM is attached.
