Executive Summary 

</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">This report on the status of implementation of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution 
of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) has been prepared pursuant to article 
7.9  of  Chapter  VII  of  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">The  report  covers  the  period  from  1  July  2021  to  30 
September 2021  and builds  on the previous quarterly Report No. 011/21.  </a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">It provides a status 
update on progress or lack thereof in the implementation of the tasks stipulated in the R-ARCSS 
during the reporting period, highlight challenges facing the implementation, provide observations 
and concludes with recommendations for remedial measures.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">The  report  draws    from  reports  periodically  received  from  Agreement  institutions  and 
mechanisms, participatory peer-reviews of the status of implementation of the thematic chapters 
of  the  R-ARCSS  through  monthly  meetings  of  the  six  Reconstituted  Joint  Monitoring  and 
Evaluation Commission (RJMEC) Working Committees, RJMEC monthly plenary meetings and 
regular consultative meetings the RJMEC leadership convenes with the Parties to the R-ARCSS, 
other South Sudanese stakeholders and adherents, regional guarantors and International Partners 
and Friends of South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">

</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">More  than  half-way  through  the  Transitional  thirty-six  month  period,  progress  in 
implementation is relatively slow.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">Some progress have been registered particularly within Chapter 
I  of  the  Agreement  led  by  the  formation  of  the R-TGONU,  establishment  of  the  Transitional 
National Legislative Assembly (TNLA), and formation of the state government.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">Still outstanding 
is the establishment of the state legislative assemblies and the national commissions.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">CTSAMVM 
reports  that  the  ceasefire  is  holding  between  the  Parties  to  the  R-ARCSS,  however,  the  most 
important  tasks  of  the  Transitional  Security  Arrangements  (TSAs,  Chapter  II)  have  not  been 
implemented.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">There have  been small gains in humanitarian affairs (Chapter III) with the return of refugees 
and IDPs and the opening of humanitarian corridors.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">On economic reforms (Chapter IV), a PFM 
Oversight Committee has been formed and undertaken some much needed reforms.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">With regards 
to Transitional Justice issues (Chapter V) work is just getting started on the Commission for Truth 
Reconciliation and Healing while the African Union is expected to take up establishment of the 
Hybrid  Court  together  with  the  government  of  South  Sudan.  </a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">Legislation  to  determine  the 
permanent Constitution making process (Chapter VI) was recently forwarded to the TNL.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">

 </a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">Whatever  positive  progress  that  have  been  made  is  overshadowed  by  the  failure  of  the 
RTGoNU  to  make  inroads  in  key  areas  of  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">In  particular,  there  has  been  no 
movement in the graduation and deployment of the Necessary Unified Forces (NUF) as the parties 
have not reached compromise on the ratio sharing for forces and the command structure.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Failure 
to address the TSAs may have contributed to intercommunal violence and defections of military 
personnel.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">For instance, fighting among the Balanda and Azande tribes in Eastern Equatoria State 
and the defection of the former Chief of Staff of the SPLA-IO resulting in clashes in Magenis. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">There are also noted delays in the establishment of the state assemblies, as well as key national 
commissions  and  important  institutions  such  as  the  National  Audit  Chamber  and  the  Anti-
corruption  Commission.  </a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">Worse,  none  of  the  transitional  justice  institutions  have  been  set  up 
although some work has started on the Committee for Truth Reconciliation and Healing (CTRH). 
</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">The report also identifies some of the key challenges that hinder progress in implementation. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">This includes:</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">insufficient political will among the Parties to compromise where needed;</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">trust 

 

iv 

deficit  and  lack  of  confidence  among  the  Parties  including  intra-Party  disagreements  and  in-
fighting;</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">delays and lack of prioritisation of key tasks;</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">and lack of sufficient funding and resources 
needed for the full implementation of the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">

</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">Faced  with  those  challenges  the  RJMEC  Leadership  engaged  in  a  number  of  high-level 
diplomatic engagements both with the RTGoNU Presidency, the TNLA Speaker and regional 
leaders in an effort to impress upon them the urgency of addressing the critical issues that continue 
to  impede  progress  in  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">IGAD  for  its  part  convened  an 
extraordinary  meeting  to  address  the  splintering  of  the  SPLM/A-IO  and  assess  the  general 
progress of implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">

</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">Further, RJMEC makes a series of recommendations within the report that are aimed towards 
increasing the pace of implementation even as the country moves toward the holding of elections 
at the end of the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">Recommendations to the RTGoNU relate to:</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82"> </a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">immediate 
establishment of the state legislative assemblies and reconstitution of the relevant institutions and 
mechanisms at the national level;</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs to table the 
remaining reviewed bills for the Council of Minister’s approval;</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">complete the formation of the ad 
hoc Judicial Reforms Committee;</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">settle the issue of the command structure for the NUF and avail 
the necessary  financial resources for the completion of the TSAs;</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">and prioritise the establishment 
of the SRF and Board to coordinate international support to the peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">

</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">Concerning  the  TNL,  RJMEC  recommends  that  they:</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90"> </a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">embark  upon  their  legislative  and 
oversight functions in support of the implementation of the R-ARCSS, including expediting the 
enactment  of  the  pending  bills  such  as  the  Constitutional  Amendment  Bill,  the  Permanent 
Constitution-making process, and the Youth Enterprise Fund Bill;</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">and debate the FY 2021/22 
government budget.  </a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">To IGAD:</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">complete the process of nominating the Chairperson and Deputy 
Chairperson to the ad-hoc Judicial Reforms Committee;</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">urge the Parties to the Agreement for 
continued dialogue and trust-building amongst themselves on all unresolved issues;</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">convene the 
high-level ‘Leadership Retreat’ of the principals to the R-ARCSS;</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">and appeal to all actors under 
SSOMA to pursue the Sant’Egidio mediation process.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">

 </a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">To the Africa Union:</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">Finally, liaise with the RTGoNU and expedite processes that will lead 
to the establishment of the Hybrid Court of South Sudan;</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">engage the leadership of the RTGoNU 
and  mobilise  the  political  support  and  goodwill  necessary  for  full  implementation  of  the  R-
ARCSS;</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102"> </a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">and  consider  mobilizing  the  requisite  resources  for  conflict  prevention,  post-conflict 
reconstruction, strengthening state institutions and nation building in South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">Finally to the 
International Community and friends of South Sudan:</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">continue to engage the leadership of the 
RTGoNU and mobilise political and moral support and goodwill for full implementation of the 
R-ARCSS;</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106"> </a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">and  continue  to  mobilize  the  requisite  resources  for  and  coordinate  provision  of 
humanitarian response to those in dire need of assistance in the Republic of South Sudan.

<p><a id="167" name="167">This section of the Quarterly Report provides an update on the status of implementation 
of Chapter I of the R-ARCSS, related to the Revitalized Transitional Government of National 
Unity (RTGoNU).</a></p>
<p><a id="168" name="168">The update builds on the last quarter report, detailing tasks which have been

accomplished during the reporting period, implementation which are ongoing and tasks whose 
implementation are outstanding.</a></p>

 Transitional National Legislative Assembly, Council of States and the States Legislature 
7.     </a></p>
<p><a id="170" name="170">During the reporting period, the Transitional National Legislature (TNL) comprising the 
Transitional National Legislative Assembly (TNLA) and the Council of  States (CoS)  were 
reconstituted, and held their inaugural sitting on 30 August 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="171" name="171">Notably, the Speaker of the 
reconstituted  TNLA  and  a  Deputy  Speaker  of  the  CoS,  who  were  both  nominated  by  the 
incumbent TGoNU, are women.</a></p>
<p><a id="172" name="172">Nevertheless the number of women in the TNLA does not 
reach the 35 percent representation stipulated in the R-ARCSS.  
8.     </a></p>
<p><a id="173" name="173">The TNLA was sworn in without the members belonging to the Other Political Parties 
(OPP), who had experienced difficulties in reaching consensus on a full list of their nominees 
to the TNL.</a></p>
<p><a id="174" name="174">In spite of several efforts invested to assist them, the OPP signatories failed to 
reach consensus.</a></p>
<p><a id="175" name="175">The issue was later referred to RJMEC pursuant to article 7.11 of the R-
ARCSS as a deadlock to be dealt with.</a></p>
<p><a id="176" name="176">RJMEC subsequently provided recommendations on 
how  the  deadlock  could  be  broken,  and  was  duly  communicated  to  the  OPP.  </a></p>
<p><a id="177" name="177">The 
recommendations  were  not  accepted  by  one  member  of  the  OPP  signatories.  </a></p>
<p><a id="178" name="178">A  further 
intervention undertaken by the President finally resulted in the resolution of the disagreement 
over  the  share  of  responsibilities  amongst  the  OPP  signatories  to  the  R-ARCSS  and  the 
appointment of the members to both houses.</a></p>

<p><a id="180" name="180">Judicial Reforms  
9.    </a></p>
<p><a id="181" name="181">There has been some progress towards establishment of the long delayed  ad hoc Judicial 
Reform Committee (JRC) pursuant to article 1.17 of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="182" name="182">As reported during the last 
quarter, the JRC Terms of Reference was approved.</a></p>
<p><a id="183" name="183">The JRC was to be established no later 
than  three  months  into  the  Transitional  Period,  and  is  tasked  to  study  and  make 
recommendations on judicial reforms to the RTGoNU, which will be undertaken by the Judicial 
Service Commission.</a></p>
<p><a id="184" name="184">The membership of the JRC is to be drawn from the Parties to the R-
ARCSS and the Inter Government Authority on Development (IGAD).</a></p>
<p><a id="185" name="185">The Sudan People’s 
Liberation  Movement  /  Army  –  In  Opposition  (SPLMA/A-IO),  South  Sudan  Opposition 
Movement (SSOA), Former Detainees (FDs) and the OPP have submitted the names of their 
nominees for the JRC to IGAD.</a></p>
<p><a id="186" name="186">However, the ITGoNU is yet to submit the list of its nominees 
and IGAD is still required to conclude the recruitment of the Chairperson and a deputy of the 
JRC.</a></p>

10. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="189" name="189">In September 2021, the RTGoNU Council of Ministers approved the Prisons Service, 
the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) and the Police Service amendment bills.</a></p>
<p><a id="190" name="190">The bills 
are  part  of  the  six  security  bills  submitted  in  2019  to  the  RTGoNU  by  the  National 
Constitutional Amendment Committee (NCAC) for enactment.</a></p>
<p><a id="191" name="191">The Council also approved two 
constitutional amendment bills, namely, the Constitutional Amendment Bill (CAB) No.8, 2020 
(as amended) which rectifies the discrepancies detected in the CAB No.6, (2020).</a></p>
<p><a id="192" name="192">The CAB, 
No.6 incorporated the R-ARCSS into the Transitional Constitution of the Republic of South 
Sudan,  2011,  (as  amended).  </a></p>

11.  </a></p>
<p><a id="197" name="197">The Governance Working Committee held two meetings during the quarter, and so far 
has convened seven meetings.</a></p>
<p><a id="198" name="198">The Committee’s work contributes to the overall mandate of 
RJMEC through the technical process of tracking the implementation of chapter I of the R-
ARCSS,  including  identifying  specific  areas  requiring  further  support,  challenges  facing 
implementation  and  offering  recommendations  for  remedial  measures.  </a></p>

<p><a id="201" name="201">In spite of the developments highlighted above, there are tasks which remain pending 
under  chapter  I  of  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="202" name="202">These  include,  inter  alia,  the  reconstitution  of  the  State 
Legislature,  completion  of  the  reconstitution  of  the  structure  of  governance  at  the 
Administrative  Areas,  as  well  as  restructuring  and  reconstitution  of  the  Institutions  and 
Commissions at the national level, while taking into consideration the minimum threshold of 
35% women representation.</a></p>
<p><a id="203" name="203">There is also need for the RTGoNU to start preparing for elections 
early enough.</a></p>
<p><a id="204" name="204">This will necessitate that the RTGoNU and the national stakeholders commence 
conversations  on  expediting  sequencing  of  implementation  of  critical  tasks  leading  to 
democratic  elections  at  the  end  of  the  Transitional  Period.  </a></p>
<p><a id="205" name="205">Furthermore,  further  delays  in 
ensuring that the NCAC resumes its work in the earnest will hurt the process of review and 
amendments of relevant laws of South Sudan to conform to the provisions of the R-ARCSS. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="206" name="206">IGAD leadership will need to expedite the reconvening of the NCAC in a timely manner.</a></p>

<p><a id="211" name="211">Security incidents of particular concern during this reporting period have included a 16  
August 2021 ambush on a convoy of religious leaders and followers returning from a Catholic

including two Roman Catholic nuns.</a></p>
<p><a id="212" name="212">Another young man was burned to death in his vehicle. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="213" name="213">Although  the  perpetrators  were  alleged  to  be  uniformed  personnel,  neither  the  National 
Salvation  Front  (NAS)  of  General  Thomas  Cirillo  nor  the  South  Sudan  Peoples’  Defense

the  Nimule  Road  and  other  major  routes  in  the  Equatorias  has  changed  little  during  the

<p><a id="215" name="215">Despite promises from national and state authorities that patrols would be 
effective, and the implementation of various measures aimed at ensuring safety for travellers 
and cargo, many roads in the Equatorias continue to be unsafe and insecure.

<p><a id="216" name="216">The CTSAMVM recently concluded its investigation of a murder incident that occurred 
on 31 May 2021 at Gambri, Lainya County, Central Equatoria State (CES).</a></p>
<p><a id="217" name="217">CTSAMVM’s 
conclusion following a thorough investigation is that a group of SSPDF soldiers are responsible 
for the killing of a sub-chief, a minister of the Episcopal Church of South Sudan, and a 10 year 
old boy on 31 May 2021 at Gambri.</a></p>
<p><a id="218" name="218">CTSAMVM recommended that the SSPDF undertake an 
enquiry into the killings and take the appropriate action.

<p><a id="219" name="219">On 22 August 2021, suspected NAS elements raided the Nyore  Internally Displaced 
Person (IDP) Camp in the Lasue area of Central Equatoria State looted humanitarian supplies, 
abducted 49 people, and raped a 12- year old girl.</a></p>
<p><a id="220" name="220">Attacks on humanitarian convoys were also 
reported  in  Central  Equatoria  State,  allegedly  by  NAS  fighters.  </a></p>

<p><a id="222" name="222">Incidents of inter-community violence resulting from cattle theft and revenge attacks 
have continued unabated across the country during this period.</a></p>
<p><a id="223" name="223">The latest flare up was in CES 
between Mundari clans and Dinka Bor cattle keepers who migrated to the Equatorias as a result 
of floods in 2019 and 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="224" name="224">Fighting took place on 6 and 7 August 2021 around Luri.  </a></p>
<p><a id="225" name="225">The 
Mundari cattle keeping clans who have been fighting for weeks on the outskirts of Juba finally 
accepted  the  directives  from  both  national  and state  authorities  to  withdraw  from  the  Juba 
suburbs and were escorted out by SSPDF between 16 and 22 August 2021.

<p><a id="226" name="226">The friction and dissent within the SPLM/A-IO that has been simmering over the past 
few months erupted into violence on 7 and 8 August 2021 with clashes between forces loyal to 
H.E Dr. Riek Machar, and those loyal to 1st Lt Gen Simon Gatwech the former Chief of Staff 
(COS) of the SPLA-IO and Lt Gen Johnson Olony near Magenis in Upper Nile State.</a></p>
<p><a id="227" name="227">The 
violence took place just days after the announcement of an SPLM/IO leadership split.1  </a></p>
<p><a id="228" name="228">The 
intensity  of  the  fighting  between  the  SPLA-A/IO  forces  created  serious  concern  about  a 
potential threat to the Peace Agreement and led to the convening of the 73rd Extraordinary 
Meeting of the IGAD Council of Ministers (COM) on 9 August, 2021.  
19.  </a></p>
<p><a id="229" name="229">Since then, further clashes were reported on 16 and 17 August 2021, as well as on 13

<p><a id="232" name="232">In what has become known as the Kit-Gwang Declaration, General Gatwech Dual the longstanding Chief of 
Staff of the SPLA-IO, who was fired from his post by Dr. Riek Machar, announced that following a meeting of a 
few other generals and ground commanders, they had removed Dr. Machar as the Chairman of the SPLM/A-IO. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="233" name="233">Consequently, General Gatwech appointed himself as the new Chairman of the SPLM/A-IO with Lt General 
Olony Johnson as his deputy.</a></p>
<p><a id="234" name="234">In response,  Dr. Machar called a meeting of the Political Bureau of the SPLM/A-
IO and hastily denounced the announcement by Gen Gatwech.</a></p>
<p><a id="235" name="235">A few days after the announcement the two groups 
allegedly clashed leaving many dead and injured.</a></p>
<p><a id="236" name="236">Since the split announced by General Gatwech, the Deputy 
Chairman of the SPLM/A-IO Henry Odwar announced his resignation as Minister of Mining and threw his support

<p><a id="449" name="449">The process included the direct involvement of the IGAD Chairman and diplomacy by the Interim 
RJMEC Chairperson with various IGAD leaders to get more directly engaged.</a></p>
<p><a id="450" name="450">Largely on account of these stepped 
up efforts, the Parties were presented with a proposal by the IGAD Chairperson of a 60:40 ratio between the 
government and opposition forces, which was meant to resolve the issue.</a></p>

Observations 

59. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="521" name="521">12 September 2021 marked three years since the signing of the R-ARCSS, and the 
nineteenth of the 36 months of the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="522" name="522">Some good progress have been realized 
particularly  within  Chapter  I  of  the  Agreement  led  by  the  formation  of  the  R-TGONU, 
establishment  of  the  Transitional  National  Legislature  (TNL),  and  formation  of  the  state 
government.</a></p>
<p><a id="523" name="523">Still outstanding is the establishment of the state assemblies and the national 
commissions.</a></p>
<p><a id="524" name="524">Unfortunately, there has not been much progress on the Transitional Security 
Arrangements as the Parties continue to disagree over ratio sharing at the command level. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="525" name="525">There have   been small  gains in humanitarian  affairs (Chapter  III)  and  economic reforms 
(Chapter  IV).</a></p>
<p><a id="526" name="526">With regards to Transitional Justice issues (Chapter V) work is just getting 
started on the Commission for Truth Reconciliation and Healing while the African Union is 
expected to take up establishment of the Hybrid Court together with the government of South 
Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="527" name="527">Legislation to determine the permanent Constitution making process (Chapter VI) was 
recently forwarded to the TNL (See Box 2).</a></p>
<p><a id="528" name="528">
 
</a></p>
<p><a id="529" name="529">Critical challenges facing implementation 
60.  </a></p>
<p><a id="530" name="530">For the most part, a number of severe challenges remain, which have severely limited 
progress  in  the  pace  of  implementation.  </a></p>
<p><a id="531" name="531">These  cross-cutting  challenges  throughout  the 
Agreement must be urgently and collectively addressed, if progress is to be sustained and 
accelerated.</a></p>
<p><a id="532" name="532">These are:</a></p>
<p><a id="533" name="533"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="534" name="534">60.1.    insufficient  political  will  among  the  Parties  to  compromise  where  needed  and 

adhere to the letter and spirit of the Agreement;</a></p>
<p><a id="535" name="535">

60.2.    trust  deficit  and  lack  of  confidence  among  the  Parties  including  intra-Party 
disagreements  and  in-fighting,  which  continues  to  undermine  progress  in 
implementation of the Agreement generally;</a></p>
<p><a id="536" name="536">

60.3.    missed timelines, delays and lack of prioritisation of key tasks, and inability of the 
Parties to sufficiently coordinate, cooperate, collaborate, compromise, and to forge 
consensus;</a></p>
<p><a id="537" name="537">

60.4.    lack of sufficient funding and resources needed for the full implementation of the 
Agreement generally, and lack of prioritisation  of critical security tasks such as 
Phase  1  graduation  and  redeployment  of  the  NUFs,  logistical  supply  for  the 
cantonment sites and training centres, and the DDR Commission;</a></p>
<p><a id="538" name="538">and 

60.5.    lack  of  efficient  and  effective  coordination  between  the  NTC  and  the  Security 

Mechanisms, especially on logistics planning, and finance.</a></p>
<p><a id="539" name="539">

61.  </a></p>
<p><a id="540" name="540">Non-completion of the unification of forces, including failure to so far reach agreement 
on the command structure and force ratios, and the absence of any redeployment of the trained 
component of the NUF threatens the very foundation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="541" name="541">Notably, this failure 
contributes to the worsening security situation at the subnational level, compounds public 
frustration with the Parties, and undermines confidence in the peace process.</a></p>

<p><a id="644" name="644">Conclusion 

64.  </a></p>
<p><a id="645" name="645">With more than three years since the signing of the R-ARCSS having gone by, the 
South Sudanese population, stakeholders, and peace partners are expressing increased levels 
of frustration at the slow pace of implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="646" name="646">Within the timelines of the Agreement, the 
Transitional Period is expected to end in February 2023, preceded by elections conducted 60 
days prior, under a new Permanent Constitution.</a></p>
<p><a id="647" name="647">For all that has been achieved much remains 
to be done.</a></p>
<p><a id="648" name="648">Indeed the people of South Sudan weary of the years of conflict are looking to the 
implementation of the R-ARCSS as a step towards lasting and sustainable peace. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="649" name="649">65. 
 </a></p>
<p><a id="650" name="650">It is clear that much effort is required on the part of the RTGoNU and TNL to keep 
the implementation of the R-ARCSS at a pace which will realise the holding of elections at the 
end of the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="651" name="651">The RTGoNU in particular, is expected to demonstrate political 
will and commit the requisite level of resources toward implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="652" name="652">This should include 
its commitment under the R-ARCSS to a US $100 million yearly contribution to a Special 
Reconstruction  Fund,  which  is  expected  to  attract  additional  support  from  international 
partners.</a></p>
<p><a id="653" name="653">The RTGoNU is also expected to focus attention on implementing the remaining tasks 
and in particular that of resolving the Transitional Security Arrangements.</a></p>
<p><a id="654" name="654">At the same time, 
the TNL must move quickly to enact legislation that is already before it and initiate the process 
of review for what remains.  
66. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="655" name="655">On its part and pursuant to its mandate as provided for in Chapter 7 of the R-ARCSS, 
the RJMEC will continue to monitor, evaluate, report on the status of implementation of the R-
ARCSS, as circumstances demand, intervene to break any deadlock that may emerge in the 
course of implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="656" name="656">It will regularly provide reports and briefings to the RTGoNU, the 
reconstituted TNLA, Chairperson of the IGAD Assembly of Heads of State and Government, 
Chairperson  of  the  IGAD  Council  of  Ministers,  the  Chairperson  of  the  African  Union 
Commission, the Peace and Security Council of the African Union and to the Secretary General 
of the United Nations and the Security Council of the United Nations.</a></p>
