Introduction

1. Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">

a. The SPLM/A-IO had been controlling the two counties of Maiwut and
Longechuk with forces at Jekau and occupying other areas of Kuerkeem,
Wangkuarbiy, Lolnyaang and Biyien.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">They had been in these positions since
the signing of the R-ARCSS in September 2018.

b. Maj Gen James Khor Chuol Giet and Maj Gen James Ochan Puot defected
from SPLM/A-IO and were integrated into SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">However, they remained
occupying positions and commanding forces in close proximity with SPLM/A-
</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">IO positions.

</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">c. Since January 2022, tensions began rising with SPLM/A-lO alleging that
SSPDF was planning to attack their positions with intentions to push the
SPLM/A-IO forces and takeover control of all their positions.

2. Allegations:</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">

a. On 05 Feb 22, CTSAMVM received information that on the same day (Sat, 05
Feb 22) at 0940hrs, SSPDF forces under the overall command of Maj. Gen.
James Khor Chuol at Muor and Majiok villages, commanded by Col. Mangok
Wuor and deputized by Lt. Col. John Nyal attacked Longechunk and Mathiang
areas causing massive displacement of civilians.

b. It was also alleged that the above attacks caused displacements of civilians by
forces under the overall command of Maj. Gen. James Khor Chuol at Muor, and

Majiok villages commanded by Col.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">Mangok Wuor and deputized by Lt. Col.

</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">John Nyal on 05 Feb 22 at 0940hrs.

</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">c. On 20 Mar 22, CTSAMVM received information that at around 0850hrs, SSPDF
forces had attacked SPLM/A-IO positions at Jekau, Kuerkeem, Wangkuarbiy,
Lolnyaang and Biyien.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">It was further alleged that the cause of the conflict in
Maiwut was because SSPDF wanted to push away SPLM/A-IO forces and
takeover control of all their positions yet these positions were allocated to
SPLM/A-IO by the Agreement

d.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">On 23 Mar 22, CTSAMVM received information that the forces loyal to Maj Gen
Khor Chuol Giet were in Dutjiok by 22 March 2022 moving towards Longechuk
County HQ with intentions to attack the SPLM/A-IO Division  HQ.

</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">•. On 24 Mar 22, CTSAMVM was informed that the SPLM/A-IO forces at
Guol/Panomdejop about 25kms south of Mathiang, Longechuk County HQ had
been attacked in the morning by SSPDF forces from Malual Gahoth under the
command of Maj Gen James Khor Chuol Giet combined with forces of Maj Gen
James Ochan Puot from SSPDF Special Operations Brigade in Maiwut.

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">Aim</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">:</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">The aim of this report is to provide preliminary findings of CTSAMVM
investigations into the allegations, attribute responsibility for breaches of the
agreements where applicable and to make recommendations.

4.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">

a. CTSAMVM Sector Il HQ combined with MVT Malakal undertook a Long
Duration Patrol (LDP) to Maiwut and Longechuk Counties on 07 — 13 April
2022.

b. CTSAMVM interviewed the County Commissioner of Maiwut Hon.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">Bang
Kawich Deng, “Brig Gen” James Gatwech Ruth (the Turu Declaration
Chairman), Deputy Cmdr SSPDF Special Ops Bde in Maiwut, Former

SPLM/A-IO Women League Representative in Maiwut, Bde 18 SSPDF Cmar,
Chief of Arab nomads in Pagak, Maj Gen James Khor Chuol Giet, Chief
Executive Director of Pagak.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">Finally, the team had a telephone engagement
with SPLM/A-IO Deputy Cmdr  Division.

</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">c. CTSAMVM was not able to go to Wangkuerbiy, Jekau and Malual Gahoth
because according to the Maiwut County Commissioner, “it was not safe for
the MVT to go to the said locations because he could not guarantee the
team’s safety”.

d. The standard of proof used by CTSAMVM to determine whether there is
sufficient evidence to verify that a Party is not in compliance with the
provisions of the Agreements is “reasonable grounds to believe that the
incident that is the subject of the investigation occurred.”</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">This is in
accordance with accepted practice for monitoring mechanisms and
humanitarian entities and signifies that sufficient facts and evidence have
been collected to conclude that an event has occurred.

Findings

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">The SPLM/A-IO positions at Wangkuerbiy, Kuerkeem, Loolnyang and Jekau
were attacked on 20 Mar 22.

6.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">The SPLM/A-IO forces were dislodged from their Division  HQ at Jekau during
the attack on 20 Mar 22.

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">There was movement of forces of SSPDF 18 Bde forces from their HQ in Pagak
to attack SPLM/A-IO Barracks at Yambura and Wangkuerbiy on 09 Jan 22 to
revenge for their soldier who was allegedly killed by SPLM/A-IO forces which was
a violation of Arts 2.0.2, 2.1.9, 2.2.10.0.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">According to the statements of “Brig Gen” James Gatwech, the Turu Declaration
Chairman, and Brig Gen Nhial Nyal Ding, Deputy Cmdr SSPDF Special Ops Bde,

the attackers are alleged to be armed civilians (Armed Youth) mobilized and
commanded by Brig Gen James Gatwech, the Chairman of TURU
DECLARATION assisted by members of his team from the Maiwut  County
government and from Juba who mobilized the Youth and other civilians and led
them to attack the SPLM/A-IO positions on 20 Mar 22.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">The members of Brig Gen
James Gatwech’s team are also Turu Declaration members and they include:</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">

a.       Mr. Dhan Chuol Kuoth — (Executive Director of Maiwut County)

b.      Mr. Gatluak Manytap Pal — (from Juba)

CG:</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">     Mr. Koang Simon Tut — (from Juba)

d.      Madam Elizabeth Mete Puok — (from Juba)

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">The security situation at the time of the LDP was still tense and unpredictable in
Jekau, Wangkuerbiy, Kuerkeem, LolNyang and Malual Gahoth due the
information that the SPLM/A-IO forces and their allied White Army were moving
from Mandeng, Nasir and Longechuk to attack Malual Gahoth and Jekau ina bid
to recapture Jekau.

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">The alleged spontaneous attack on SSPDF soldiers by SPLM/A-IO and killing of
Pte Marko Okil Salvatore Lomin on 15 Jan 22, Pte Nicola Lado Otongo Micheal
on 08 Mar 22, and Sgt Sultan Hassan on 20 Mar 22, appears to be a violation of
Articles 2.0.2  and 2.1.9  of R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">However, CTSAMVM could not fully
conclude investigations on these alleged killings since the team did not engage
with the SPLM/A-IO commanders.

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">There is no humanitarian assistance in the area due the tension in Jekau.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">The
Maiwut County Commissioner stated that, “access to Jekau was restricted”.

12.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">When CTSAMVM insisted on going to Wangkuerbiy to meet with SPLM/A-IO,
“Brig Gen” James Gatwech said that there are no SPLM/A-IO forces in
Wangkuerbiy.

Assessment
13.Based on the statements of the various witnesses interviewed, CTSAMVM
assesses that:</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">
a.    Attack on SPLM/A-IO positions in Maiwut County.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">It was confirmed
that the SPLM/A-IO positions in Maiwut County at Jekau, Wangkuerbiy,
Kuerkeem and LolNyang were attacked on 20 Mar 22 and overrun.  </a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">However,
CTSAMVM could not ascertain the Party forces that attacked SPLM-IO since
it was not possible to visit Jakau and Wangkuerbiy or to physically engage
with the SPLM/A-IO forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">The SSPDF denied the allegations during the
investigations.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">However, “Brig Gen” James Gatwech, the Turu Declaration
Chairman came out openly to claim that him and his armed civilians from the
Cie Chany community in Turu, Jekau, and Nyetok Payams are the ones who
attacked SPLM/A-IO on 20 Mar 22.
</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">b.    Security situation.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">The security situation was still tense and
unpredictable in Jekau, * Wangkuerbiy,  Kuerkeem, LolNyang and Malual
Gahoth due the information that the SPLM/A-IO forces and their allied White
Army were moving from Mandeng, Nasir and Longechuk to attack Malual
Gahoth and Jekau in a bid to recapture Jekau having been their HQ of Div 5.
</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">CG   Access.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Access ‘to Jekau, Wangkuerbiy, Kuerkeem, LoINyang and
Malual Gahoth was still very difficult due to the unpredictability of the security
situation in those areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">The Maiwut County Commissioner could not
guarantee security and safety of the CTSAMVM personnel.
</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">d.    Causes of the conflict.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">Among other unknown factors, the conflict in
Maiwut is assessed to have been caused by internal political grievances
within SPLM/A-IO Party and Defections from SPLM/A-IO ranks.
</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">•.    Violations.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">The events in Maiwut and Longechuk Counties constitute
violations of the R-ARCSS and Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities (21
December 2017, ACoH) by the party signatories.
</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">t;</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">     The County Commissioner of Maiwut (ITGoNU) seemed to admit that
he knows more about the attack on SPLM/A-IO positions on 20 Mar 22, when
he stated that, the events that led to the 20 Mar 22 attacks on the IO
positions started from when he took over office as Commissioner in May
2021 and the SPLM/A-IO refused movement of civilians from Jekau, Turu
to go to Maiwut.

g.     Torture allegations.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">The allegations of torture of civilians could not be
proven because the CTSAMVM was unable to meet any civilian victims.
</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">CTSAMVM was told that the NGO workers who were tortured had been taken
to Ethiopia for treatment.

Conclusion

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that SPLM/A-IO positions in Maiwut County at
Jekau, Wangkuerbiy, Kuerkeem and LolNyang were attacked and overrun on
20 Mar 22 by the SSPDF aligned forces of “Brig Gen” James Gatwech, the Turu
Declaration Chairman in violation of Article 2.2.4  and 2.3.10.0  of the R-ARCSS
and Article  2) (a) and (d) of the ACoH.

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">The political leadership of Maiwut County is responsible for the humanitarian
crisis in the area.

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">SSPDF should take responsibility of the actions of “Brig Gen” James Gatwech,
the Turu Declaration Chairman which they have not condemned.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">These actions
violate R-ARCSS, Article 2.0.4, 2.1.10.0.2.

Observations and Recommendations

17.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">CTSAMVM recommends that JDB quickly constitute a team for a fact-finding
mission, de-escalate the tensions and resolve the security situations in Maiwut
and Longechuk.

18.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">It is strongly recommended that CTSMAVM be allowed access to Jekau to
conclude this investigation.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">It is difficult to make reasonable conclusions without
engaging both parties especially the aggrieved SPLM/A-IO and the victim
civilians.

19.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">Need to fast track processes of building the Necessary Unified Forces to address
such conflicts.
