 CTSAMM REPORT NUMBER 2018/04


REPORT ON VIOLATIONS IN THE MUNDRI AREA
Executive Summary
The area south of Mundri has long been associated with allegations by both Parties
blaming each other for offensive and provocative actions.</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">Following the signing of the
ACOH on 21 December 2017 there have been a series of movements by the SPLA
which led to some looting and a clash with SPLA-IO (RM) forces.
</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">Movements carried out by the SPLA following the agreed 24 December implementation
date of the ACOH were undertaken without CTSAMM being informed.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">It became
apparent that senior officers at the SPLA HQ in MUNDRI were ignorant of those
provisions of the ACOH which required them to give advance notice of any movement
to CRSAMM.
</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">It is the opinion of CTSAMM that movements by the SPLA between 22 December 2017
and  January 2018 violated both the word and the spirit of the ACOH.


 1.0  Introduction


1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">


•</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">MUNDRI is held by the SPLA.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">The area south of MUNDRI is dominated by
the SPLA-IO (RM).</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">The SPLA maintain a garrison at BARI and in other
villages.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">The current status of GARIYA is unclear.


</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">•</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">Over the past  months there have been a series of allegations concerning
clashes between the SPLA and SPLA-IO (RM), with both sides accusing the
other if initiating the violence.


</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">•</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">From 22-28 December 2017, the MVT based in Yambio received a series of
allegations as follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">


o It was alleged that starting on 22 December the SPLA, involved in
operations to open roads in the area passed through BANGOLO looting
as they went.


</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">o On 24 December there was a clash at LADIMWA between the SPLA and
SPLA-IO (RM) caused by the SPLA moving from BARI towards GARIYA.


</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">o On 28 December 2017, it was further alleged that the SPLA moved four
land-cruisers and an armoured vehicle from MUNDRI to GARIYA.


</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">•</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">There was further information to suggest that there had been an SPLA
movement between MUNDRI and GARIYA on  January 2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">CTSAMM
had not been informed about this.


</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">1.2  Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">The purpose of this report is to summarise the findings of the CTSAMM
investigation into alleged military movement and clashes in the MUNDRI area,
apportion responsibility where possible and make recommendations.


 </a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">1.3  Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">


•</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">The Yambio MVT maintain contact with both the SPLA in MUNDRI and SPLA-
 (RM) forces to the south.  </a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">They also have civilian contacts in the area.


</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">•</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">The MVT visited BANGOLO on  January 2018 in order to investigate the
allegations.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">There they met traditional leaders and a large number of local
civilians, NGO representatives and SPLA-IO (RM) officers from their nearby
headquarters.


</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">•</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">Following the visit to BANGOLO the MVT contacted senior SPLA officers in
MUNDRI for comment.


</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">2.0  Findings


2.1  SPLA personnel did steal property including motorcycles and bicycles, food
items and bedding from the people of BANGOLO when they passed through on
or about 22 December 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">Local contacts witnessed SPLA soldiers selling
looted items in the market at MUNDRI soon after the incident.


2.2  The SPLA deny there was any sort of clash at LADIMWA on 24 December.
</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">However, the CTSAMM MVT received information from multiple sources within
the community and also from an NGO suggesting that it did happen.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">All the
evidence suggests that the clash was caused by SPLA troops moving into areas
dominated by SPLA-IO (RM) forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">The SPLA-IO (RM) claimed that their
Deputy Commander was killed in the action, but CTSAMM were unable to
corroborate this.


</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">2.3  Allegations that the SPLA moved towards GARIYA with land cruisers and an
armoured vehicles on 28 December were denied by the SPLA.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">However, there
was contradictory information given by officers at the SPLA HQ:</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">the Deputy
Commander claimed that the SPLA had held GARIYA since November 2017
whereas another senior officer said they had not been to GARIYA.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">The


 CTSAMM MVT has yet to visit GARIYA.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">Evidence from local people suggests
there was some sort of movement by the SPLA on 28 December but details are
unconfirmed.


</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">2.4  The SPLA did admit to a movement from MUNDRI on  January, saying it was
an administrative convoy to support their troops in FARASIKA, KARIKA, LAZULU
and KOTIBI.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">They did not give CTSAMM advance notice of this movement
because they did not have a copy of the ACOH and had not been told they are
now required to so this.


</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">


3.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">The situation in the area south of MUNDRI is complex, and contradictory reports
from the SPLA have made it difficult for the MVT investigating the allegations.
</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">However, it is clear that in the period since 22 December, and especially after
the 24 December start date of the ACOH there has been increased SPLA activity
in the area, the looting of civilian property by SPLA personnel in BANGOLO and
a clash between the SPLA and SPLA-IO (RM) units at LADIMWA


3.2  Itis apparent that senior SPLA officers in the Headquarters in MUNDRI remained
ignorant of the provisions of the ACOH even as late at  January, when they
carried out an administrative move without having first informed CTSAMM.


3.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">There have been contradictory claims by the SPLA about the location of their
forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">The SPLA have not and in this instance did not declare the locations of
their units, most importantly those in close proximity with opposing forces.


</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">3.4  Conclusion:</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">


•</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">There is no doubt that the SPLA carried out a series of movements in the
area south of MUNDRI at the time the ACOH came into effect.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">These
movements led to a clash with SPLA-IO (RM) forces, and during these


 movements the local population suffered some theft and looting by SPLA
personnel.


</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">•</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Senior SPLA officers in the HQ in MUNDRI were ignorant of the provisions of
the ACOH which indicates the SPLA have failed to inform its personnel


•</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">The actions of the SPLA between 22 December 2017 and  January 2018 in
the area south of MUNDRI have been in violation of the following articles of
the ACOH:</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">


o Article One :</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">“...cease all hostile military actions and operations in
furtherance of armed conflict...”


o Article One :</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">“All forces shall immediately freeze in place, except for
movements authorized by CTSAMM.......”


o Article One :</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">“...each Party shall notify its commanders and affiliates
of the Agreement...”


o Article Five :</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">“...shall not loot property...”


o Article Eleven :</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">“The Parties will provide CTSAMM with the
information it requires for the discharge of its duties, including.. the
location of its forces”


4.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">


4.1  In carrying out a series of moves in the area south of MUNDRI at a time the
ACOH was to come into effect, the SPLA not only violated the word of the
agreement, but also ignored the spirit of the agreement.


</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">4.2  The area south of MUNDRI is a potential flashpoint, and has been for some time.
</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">In order that the ACOH can be implemented in the area, it is vital that both
the SPLA and the SPLA-IO (RM) declare and agree the locations of their


 respective forces, and measures are taken to disengage where they are in close
proximity.


4.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">CTSAMM notes with concern that senior officers in an SPLA Divisional
Headquarters proved ignorant of the provisions of the ACOH.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">CTSAMM calls on
the SPLA to ensure that the ACOH is promulgated effectively and officers are
given the training they need in order to understand it.


</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">4.4  CTSAMM calls on the IGAD Council of Minister and JMEC to apply all possible
pressure on the Parties to honour their commitments under the ACOH.


</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">4.5| CTSAMM will be visiting the area again in the near future in order to follow up
this report and get a better understanding of the status and locations of both
SPLA and SPLA -IO (RM) forces in the area.</a></p>
