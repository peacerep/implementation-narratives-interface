KILLING AND DISPLACEMENT OF CIVILIAN IN PAJOK
Executive Summary
There has been ongoing conflict in the eastern part of Eastern Equatoria State, and on
 April 2017 Government Forces mounted an operation against SPLM/A-IO forces in
the area of Pajok.</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8">There were reports of civilians being killed, and a large number fled
towards Uganda.
</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">Subsequent investigations by CTSAMM found clear evidence that Government Forces,
had indeed deliberately and in cold blood killed a number of civilians before, during or
after operations against SPLM/A-IO positions several kilometers from Pajok.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">There had
also been looting of houses and community assets.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">The  majority of the civilian
population fled either before or during the fighting.
</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">It is the clear opinion of CTSAMM that the actions of Government Forces on Pajok on
or around  April 2017 were in clear and blatant violation of both the spirit and the word
of the ARCSS.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">It should be of grave concern to JMEC that the Government appears to allow acts of
violence by the Security Forces against its own people, and that this violence is directed
in such a manner as to appear to have an ethnic dimension that results in mass
displacement of citizens of particular ethnicity.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">Those responsible should be held to
account.

<p><a id="15" name="15">KILLING AND DISPLACEMENT OF CIVILIANS IN PAJOK

1.0  Introduction

1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">Pajok payam is strategically located on the Ugandan border, and until
recently remained relatively calm.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">However, the presence of an SPLM/A-IO
unit about  km from Pajok, rising tensions in the Eastern Equatoria region
and events in neighbouring Magwi County led to a feeling of insecurity.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">There have been no reports of previous conflict between Government Forces
and the SPLM/A-IO in the Pajok area, but there have been ambushes on the
Torit to Pajok road and other attacks in Magwi County linked to SPLM/A-IO
activity.

1.2  Incidents:</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">On  April 2017 Government Forces mounted offensive operations
against SPLM/A-IO forces in the Pajok area.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">During these operations, deliberate
attacks were made against the civilian population which including the shooting
and killing of at least 16 people.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">The MVT obtained substantial evidence of
looting, including photos and victim/eyewitness testimony, and also received
reports that there had been a number of rapes The majority of the civilian
population fled across the border, and the only ones to return were women
looking for children lost in the chaos, and those trying to recover food.

1.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">Aim</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">:</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">The purpose of this report is to describe what happened in Pajok and
attribute responsibility where appropriate.

1.4  Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">
•</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The MVT based in Torit reported what turned out to be preparatory troop
movements on 31 March 2017, and from then on monitored the situation
closely.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">As soon as reports of fighting were received plans were made to visit
Pajok on  April, but the joint CTSAMM/UNMISS patrol was turned back by
Government Forces and NSS personnel.
</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">•</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">On 11 April the patrol once again set out for Pajok, arriving on 12 April.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">The
MVT was able to interview the Government Forces officer in command of
operations in the Pajok area, the local director of NSS and the Ayaci County
Commissioner.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">They were also able to talk with many of the few remaining
local people who were eyewitnesses to what happened.
</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">2.0  Investigation
2.1  Timeline:</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The timeline of what happened is as follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">
•</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">31 March 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">Reports were received by the MVT that Government military
personnel were being moved towards Ayaci County from Magwi County.
</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">•</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40"> April 2017:</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">An estimated ,000 Government soldiers deployed to Ayaci
County.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">This deployment caused suspicion and fear in the local population.
</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">•</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44"> April 2017:</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">Some civilians started moving towards Pogee on the Ugandan
border.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">The word went round that some of the Government soldiers were
‘Mathiang Anyoor’ whose reputation is such that many local people were too
scared to stay.
</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">•</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48"> April 2017:</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">

o Government Forces advanced on two axes, one down the main road to
Pajok and the other east of the main road towards Lawach Boma and the
base of SPLM/A-IO forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">There was apparently little actual fighting:</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">the
SPLM/A-IO forces reportedly fled in the face of the Government Forces
advance.

o Government Forces looted Pajok and killed at least 16 civilian inhabitants.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52"> April 2017:</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">The initial CTSAMM/UNMISS patrol to Pajok was refused
access to the area by a Government Forces and NSS checkpoint.
</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">•• 12 April 2017:</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">The CTSAM/UNMISS joint patrol arrived in Pajok, and
undertook investigations before returning to Torit on 14 April.
</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">2.2— Killing of civilians:</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">
•</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">The MVT was able to get eye-witness statement from the few remaining
citizens that at least 16 civilians in the Pajok area alone were killed by
Government Forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">They were shown graves and one body, which had
been left to rot.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">Given the fact that Pajok represented only a small part of the
area within which Government Forces were operating, it is highly likely that
the total number of civilians who lost their lives is more than the 16 herein
reported.
</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">•</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">Several eye witnesses described how soldiers had  dragged men from
houses, robbed and beat them before shooting them in cold blood.
</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">•</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">On  April Government Forces used vehicles to tell civilians that they were
there to fight the rebels only and to return to their homes.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">Several of those
who obeyed this instruction were subsequently shot and killed.

2.3  Displacement of civilians.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">Accurate figures for the population of Pajok payam are not available, although
Pajok had been a busy town with a diverse population;</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">the MVT found no
more than 200 people remaining.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">Information obtained from humanitarian
agencies suggest at least ,000 people have been displaced from the area.
</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">The chief of Caigon Boma told the MVT that there were only 38 people left in
the boma:</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">15 old women and 23 old men.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">People started fleeing on  April when Government Forces started to deploy
to the area.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">On  April there was a mass exodus caused by heavy gunfire
and the actions of the soldiers:</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">harassment, looting and killing of civilians.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">Missing children:</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">

o On  April the schools were open, although few children attended.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">When
the shooting started a number of children who were at school became
separated from their parents who had fled to Uganda.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">The MVT
interviewed two women who returned to Pajok to look for their children.
</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">One woman fled when she saw two of her  neighbours killed by
Government Forces and returned on 13 April to search for her  year-old
son;</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">another returned on 12 April to look for two of her children but left in
despair when all she found was that her brother and a close neighbour
had both been killed.

o It was reported to the MVT that a number of children had gone missing
from Chemis Primary School, but no witnesses could be found and the
school was deserted.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">The issue of missing children should be further
investigated as a matter of urgency.

2.4  Looting:</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">Following the fighting of  April Government Forces looted Pajok thoroughly.
</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">Houses, shops, schools and the clinic had all been looted:</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">the MVT observed
that all goods had been taken from the shops, that the school had been looted
and its safe forcibly opened and the contents taken.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">A large quantity of looted items had been taken to a well-guarded house in
Pajok.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">On 12 and 13 April looted items from this house were seen being
loaded on a pick-up and a military truck and taken towards Magwi escorted
by Government Forces soldiers.

2.5  Humanitarian situation:</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">The MVT was able to make the following observations
about the humanitarian situation in Pajok:</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">The few people remaining in Pajok were elderly.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">Due to the looting of shops,
homes and granaries they had little to sustain them.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">They were very worried
about the lack of able-bodied people to look after them.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">The people were scared of the Government troops and lived in fear.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">The MVT were told that the situation in the camps in Uganda was not good,
and that some people had returned to Pajok to gather food only to find it had
all been looted.

2.6  Other observations:</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">Rape:</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">One of the old people remaining in Pajok complained that young
women had been raped by Government Forces soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">An officer said he
was aware of only one case of attempted rape and the soldier concerned had
been arrested;</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">he went on to admit that the soldiers get drunk and are difficult
to control.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">Because there were so few people remaining in Pajok and no
young people the MVT was not able to investigate the issue of rape further.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">Committee:</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">The MVT were told that on  April a meeting was reportedly
convened between Government Forces officers and the remaining local
people and a committee established with five representatives of the army and
five local civilians to discuss issues related to looted property and other
concerns.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">The MVT was shown the minutes of the meeting, but no names of
the civilian representatives were given, and they considered the committee
irrelevant as all looted property had been removed and also because they
were so few residents left in the area.

3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">

3.1  During operations against SPLM/A-IO forces in the Pajok area, Government
Forces not only clearly failed to protect the civilian population, but actively
committed atrocities including the beating and killing of unarmed citizens, and
the wholescale looting of private and community assets.

3.2  The actions of Government Forces were directed against citizens of minority
ethnic groups who have now fled to Uganda in yet another mass displacement
from Greater Equatoria.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">All the evidence suggests they are scared to return while
Government Forces troops are still in occupation, and it was observed by the
MVT that due to the looting they have little to return to,

4.0  Conclusion:</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">

4.1  Itis the conclusion of JTC that by committing atrocities against the civilian
population whist engaged in operations against SPLM/A-IO forces in the Pajok
area, Government Forces were in clear and blatant violation of Chapter  of the
ARCSS, particularly:</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">

Article 1.0.5:</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">“Acts of hostility, intimidation, violence or attacks against the
civilian population...”

Article 3.0  of the COHA:</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">“The parties shall refrain from attacks on the civilian
population and commit to the protection of human rights... .”

4.0  JTC concludes that by blocking the joint MVT/UNMISS patrol to Pajok on 
April, Government Forces were in clear violation Chapter II of the ARCSS,
specifically Article 7.0.b of the COHA:</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">“The MVT shall enjoy complete freedom
of movement....”

5.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">

5.1  The officers responsible for violent and illegal acts against the citizens of Pajok
should be held to account.</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">CTSAMM emphasises to JMEC if the Government
fails to investigate and take action against those who violate not  only the
provisions of the ARCSS but also national and international law, the Government
tacitly sanctions these acts and thereby becomes complicit.

5.2  The deployment of Government troops caused fear and displacement even
before the shooting began.</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">There is evidence that the actions of these soldiers

were perceived by local people to be ethnically motivated.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">This ethnic dimension,
seen elsewhere in the Equatoria region, must be of grave concern to those who
hope for a peaceful future for a united South Sudan.

5.3  All the evidence suggests that discipline within the Government Forces units
deployed to the Pajok area was almost non-existent.</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">It is strongly recommended
that Government Forces impose discipline upon their military personnel and give
the troops the training necessary for them to operate like professional soldiers
and protect rather than terrorise the civilian population.

5.4  The wholesale looting of Pajok involved Government Forces stealing from their
own people, and leaving so little that it will be difficult for those people to return.
</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">CTSAMM calls upon JMEC to encourage the Government to restore stolen
property to the people of Pajok, and to create the conditions necessary for them
to return.

5.5  CTSAMM will conduct further patrols to the Pajok area in order to monitor the
situation there.
