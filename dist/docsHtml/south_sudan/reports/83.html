<p><a id="20" name="20">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">On the afternoon of 27 April 2017 the MVT based in Wau heard reports about
an alleged attack at Kuajena early that morning.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">The MVT was then able to
join an integrated patrol that went to Kuajena the following day (28 April).

•</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">At Kuajena the MVT was able to meet with local civil and military authorities,
as well as members of the civilian population and the families of the victims.
</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">The MVT in Wau has no effective liaison with opposition forces in the area,
and so all information gathered from officials and officers was from
Government sources.

<p><a id="26" name="26">The

the killing had taken place and found spent cartridge cases where rifles had been

fired.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">The attack took place at about 6.0  Hrs on 27 April.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">After a short
engagement the attackers were repulsed by SPLA-IG troops.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">There was no
looting.

2.0  There were varied reports about the number of attackers involved.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">Initial reports
received by the MVT suggested 15, but witnesses on the ground said there were
many more.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">There could have been as many as 50 involved;</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">some said 70.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">All
witnesses described them as being in uniform and armed with AK47’s and PKM
machine-guns.

2.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">The MVT asked local government officials and SPLA-IG commanders about the
identity of the attackers and they all said they were SPLA-IO (RM).

3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">

Sil     It is the opinion of CTSAMM that the attack took place as reported.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">Credible
sources have reported SPLA-IO (RM) forces in the area and the scale of the
attack indicates a military capability.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">It is assessed that SPLA-IO (RM) forces
carried out the attack.

<p><a id="38" name="38">It
was unprovoked.</a></p>

left or were repulsed before taking any military objectives.

4.0  Conclusion:</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">

4.1  It is the opinion of CTSAMM that the attack which took place at Kuajena was a
violation of the PCTSA by Opposition Forces, particularly:</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">

Article 1.0  of the COHA:</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">“The parties shall cease all military operations......”
Article 1.1.5  of the PCTSA:</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">“Acts of hostility, intimidation, violence or attacks
against the civilian population....”

5.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>

5.1  The situation in the Kuajena are is described by locals as ‘tense’.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">There are
SPLA-IO units operating in the area.</a></p>

about one thousand IDP’s living in Kuajena.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">Attacks such as described in this
