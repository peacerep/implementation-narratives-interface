<p><a id="7" name="7">CTSAMM REPORT 052 —- VIOLATIONS IN YEI
Honourable members of CTSAMM,
Please find attached a CTSAMM JTC report on alleged violations of the Permanent
Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements (Chapter II of the Agreement on the
Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan of 26 August 2015) that took
place in the Yei area during July and August 2017.

CTSAMM REPORT NUMBER 052
VIOLATIONS IN THE YEI AREA
Executive Summary
</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">At the last CTSAMM meeting of 20 July we reported that the situation in Yei had
improved.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">Whilst it is better than it was, and it is apparent SPLA-IG authorities have
made and are making attempts to improve relations between military personnel and the
civilian population, South Sudanese citizens in Yei continue to be subjected to
harassment, looting and theft by uniformed members of the security forces.
</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">In one particularly bad incident  houses around the Episcopal Church Mission,  of
which belonged to pastors, were looted by soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">The occupants — men and women,
and the pastors themselves — were badly beaten and goods and money stolen.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">There is no freedom of movement around Yei.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">This is due to checkpoints manned by
SPLA-IG forces in a cordon  Km from the town and checkpoints manned by SPLA-IO
(RM) forces further out.
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">Citizens in Yei have no faith in the civil or military authorities because they see that
SPLA-IG personnel can act with apparent impunity.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">Many are scared to report incidents
as they fear repercussions.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">Local people report that ‘Mathiang Anyoor’ militia are still
Operating in the town.
</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">It is the opinion of CTSAMM that SPLA-IG forces in Yei are in violation of those articles
of the PCTSA pertaining to protection of civilians, and both SPLA-IG and SPLA-IO (RM)
forces are in violation of those articles pertaining to the free movement of people and
goods.

VIOLATIONS IN THE YEI AREA

1.0  </a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">Introduction

1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">

</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">•</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">The last report concerning the situation in Yei was presented at the CTSAMM
meeting on 20 July 2017, where CTSAMM commented that whilst there was
an improvement in the situation as a whole, the local population continued to
be subjected to harassment, violence, theft and rape by uniformed soldiers.

</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">•</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">SPLA-IG have reportedly replaced the commander in the area, and there is
evidence that more is being done to improve the situation.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">However, local
South Sudanese citizens still suffer at the hands of SPLA-IG personnel who
appear to be able to act with impunity.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">Violence and intimidation is also
perpetrated by SPLA-IO (RM) soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">

1.2  </a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">The purpose of this report is to outline recent violations of the PCTSA in the
Yea area (particularly those concerning the protection of civilians), and attribute
responsibility where appropriate.

1.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">

</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">•</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The evidence covered in this report comes from the first part of a patrol to the
Yei area from  to  August 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">The patrol continued until 17 August, and
the finding of the second part of the patrol will be presented at the next
CTSAMM meeting.

</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">•</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">Evidence supporting the violations reported was collected from witnesses and
victims, religious and community leaders and international NGO’s.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">The MVT
also met with both the military and civil authorities.

</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">CTSAMM CONFIDENTIAL
2.0  Findings
</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">2.1  Freedom of movement:</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">

</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">•</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">There is no freedom of movement for civilians around Yei.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">SPLA-IG maintain
checkpoints in a cordon about  Km from Yei town.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">There is a significant
SPLA-IO (RM) presence further out from Yei, in some instances less than 
Km from SPLA-IG checkpoints but generally much further than this.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">The
civilian population — women in particular — are prevented by the SPLA-IG
checkpoints from moving out of the 4Km perimeter to go farming because
they accuse them of supplying food to the SPLA-IO (RM).</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">Similarly SPLA-
|O (RM) forces prevent civilians — again mainly women — from moving to Yei
to prevent them from supplying food to the SPLA-IG garrison.

</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">•</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">The result of this denial of freedom of movement by both Parties is a scarcity
of food in Yei.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Also civilians desperate to get in and out of the town do so
using the bush rather than roads, which makes them more vulnerable to
abduction and rape.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">

2.2— Protection of civilians in Yei:</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">

</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">•</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">It was reported at the last CTSAMM meeting that the situation in Yei is
improving.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">However, the population continues to be subjected to harassment
and violence by SPLA-IG military personnel.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Citizens in Yei still refer to some
of the SPLA-IG forces as “Mathiang Anyoor”’, and still perceive what they see
as an ethnic dimension to the behaviour of SPLA-IG personnel towards local
people.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">The MVT observed and were harassed at a checkpoint by very
young, badly-disciplined soldiers who spoke only Dinka who described
themselves as Mathiang Anyoor.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Apart from sexual assaults that form part
of a separate report, there was one major case of looting, violence and
intimidation investigated by the MVT and several cases of theft and
harassment.

</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">CTSAMM CONFIDENTIAL
•</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">The Governor of what is known as Yei River State told the MVT that orders
have been given to reorganise SPLA-IG units into recognised barracks in
order to limit their impact on local communities, but gave no indication of when
this might happen and where the barrack areas might be.

2.3  Theft, assault and harassment:</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">Several examples of theft and harassment by
SPLA-IG soldiers were reported to the MVT by civil society organisations and
individuals.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">

</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">•</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">On 23 July there was a minor but unpleasant incident when SPLA-IG forcibly
stole mobile telephones from young children, and a more serious incident
involving the beating of a boda-boda driver and theft of his motorcycle.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">These
cases were reported to the police;</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">the boda-boda driver was seriously hurt
and admitted to hospital.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">

</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">•</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">On 24 July armed soldiers in SPLA-IG uniforms broke into the house of a
cassava seller, beat up a girl and her father and stole about 15000 SSP.
</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">Both people required hospital treatment after the attack which was reported
to the police.

</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">•</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">On 27 July a group of armed SPLA-IG soldiers tried to forcibly enter a
property in the Jigomoni area, and having failed to open the gate they threw
a grenade into the garden which caused damage by luckily no casualties,
and on  August  armed soldiers in SPLA-IG uniform broke into a house in
Yerdan, beat the owner and stole goods and ,000 SSP.

2.4  </a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">Looting, violence and intimidation at the Episcopal Church Mission 26 July 2017:</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">On the night of 26/27 July 2017 a group of - armed men, some wearing
SPLA-IG uniforms and all clearly soldiers attacked and looted  houses by
CTSAMM CONFIDENTIAL
the Episcopal Church Mission in Yei.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">Three of the houses belonged to
pastors.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">The occupants of the houses were all severely beaten — women
as well as men, including the pastors, one of whom started praying as he
thought he was going to be shot.

</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">•</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">Belongings and money were stolen.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">In the house of one of the pastors
savings of 25,000 SSP were taken after the pastor himself was beaten
senseless and his wife eventually gave up the money.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">In the house of
another pastor the soldiers asked him for forgiveness, saying they were
obliged to steal because they had not been paid for several months.

</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">•</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">Atthe house of the first pastor they attacked, while beating him the soldiers
blamed him for encouraging people to leave Yei.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">They also said that he
should not include any political discussion in his preaching.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">

</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">

</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">3.1  Citizens in Yei continue to be harassed and abused by soldiers from the national
army whose duty it is to protect them.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">SPLA-IG soldiers appear to be able to act
with impunity.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">

</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">3.2  </a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">The assault and robbery of pastors and their families at the Episcopal Church
Mission was a particularly unpleasant incident.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">Those members involved — men
and women, most at least middle-aged —were still suffering as a result of their
injuries when interviewed by the MVT.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">They were also still in shock, and had no
faith in the will or ability of the military or civil authorities to bring the perpetrators
to justice.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">They were deeply saddened by this, and by the fact they were
threatened because of what they have allegedly been saying in their sermons.

3.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">Freedom of movement remains a significant obstacle to any return to normal
civilian life in the Yei area.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">This issue will not be resolved until there is a

CTSAMM CONFIDENTIAL
comprehensive peace process which includes all groups on a local as well as a
national level.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">As things stand CTSAMM has little liaison with SPLA-IO (RM)
forces around Yei, and needs to further develop contacts with them in order to
confront this and other issues.</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">

</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">4.0  Conclusion:</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">

4.1  It is the clear opinion of CTSAMM that the actions of SPLA-IG forces deployed
in Yei remain in violation of those articles of the COHA and PCTSA pertaining to
the protection of civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">It is of significant concern that soldiers appear to be
able to act with impunity.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">

</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">4.2  Both SPLA-IG and SPLA-IO (RM) forces are in clear violation of Article 1.0.1  of
the PCTSA:</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">“Actions that....restrict free movement of people”

5.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">

5.1  </a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">The situation in Yei might be better than it was earlier in the year, but the MVT
report a deterioration since their last visit.</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">Last week UNHCR reported that 
million South Sudanese citizens have now fled to Uganda since July 2016 — 85%
of them women and children.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">Huge numbers of civilians have fled Yei and the
surrounding areas due to the actions of SPLA-IG and SPLA-IO (RM) soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">

5.2  Citizens in Yei itself have no faith in the ability of either the civil or military
authorities to protect them from crimes committed by SPLA-IG soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">The
police force appears powerless to take any action against soldiers, and the
military appear unable or unwilling to take any disciplinary action against those
soldiers who kill, rape, steal or loot those people they have a duty to protect.

CTSAMM CONFIDENTIAL

5.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">CTSAMM calls on JMEC to raise the issue of the suffering of the people of Yei
and the indiscipline of SPLA-IG soldiers at the highest political level, and calls on
the leadership of the SPLA-IG to demonstrate its will and ability to control its
soldiers by investigating the assault on the Episcopal Church Mission and other
crimes and holding those responsible to account.</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">

5.4.</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">CTSAMM will continue to do its best to cultivate contacts with SPLA-IO (RM)
forces in the Yei area in order to be able to address issues critical to the
protection of what remains of the civilian population of the area.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">

5.5| CTSAMM recommends that the SPLA-IG remove from the Yei area those young,
badly disciplined troops known correctly or otherwise as Mathiang Anyoor
