<p><a id="18" name="18">The general security situation in Leer/Southern Liech was relatively calm
during April and May 2016, although there were several vehicle ambushes
and tensions were sometimes high.

</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">•</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">INGOs such as MEDAIR, MSF and ICRC are located by the airstrip, from

<p><a id="24" name="24">•</a></p>

<p><a id="41" name="41">

2.0  Findings of the Investigation

2.1  On 20 June 2016, the MVT paid a visit to the " Division HQ of SPLA in Bentiu.
</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">During the interview, the Deputy Commander claimed that SPLA patrol team
was attacked by IO and three soldiers were wounded.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">

2.2  </a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">On 29 June 2016 the GHANBATT Commander in the UNMISS base briefed the
MVT that the shooting was reported by an INGO operating along the airstrip
around 17:00 hrs on 19 June 2016, and Government Forces movement to the
airstrip was later observed.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">GHANBATT patrol team sent to the site was
informed by the SPLM/A-IO commander that six AK 47s customarily kept under
the tree were forcibly taken by Government Forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">There was no killing but
one SPLM/A-IO was soldier wounded.

2.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">On 29 June 2016, the MVT visited Governor’s Office in Leer.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">The acting
Governor declared that  Government Forces soldiers were attacked by
SPLM/A-IO while patrolling on airstrip and one was shot.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">However, he
commended the restraint of the SPLM/A-IO commander who did not escalate
the situation.

2.4  On 30 June 2016, in Thonyor Payam the MVT met with Leer SPLM/A-IO
Commander, and the Commissioner.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">They accused Government Forces of
entering an SPLM/A-IO controlled area with the intention of stealing the six AK
47 rifles kept under a tree.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">This resulted in a young boy being wounded.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">They
both demanded that the guns be returned, and that they would deploy SPLM/A-
lO forces back to Payak Market or even take Leer town if there were further
provocative actions by Government Forces.

2.5  On  July 2016, the MVT visited Leer airstrip and Payak village.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">The SPLM/A-
 local Commander confirmed that on 19 June 2016, Government Forces
soldiers came to the SPLM/A-IO controlled Payak Market to insult SPLM/A-IO
soldiers and take away the guns stored under the tree.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">He also admitted the
shooting erupted only when Government Forces saw a young boy running
away with his rifle and other SPLM/A-IO soldiers arrived.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">SPLM/A-IO forces
pushed the Government Forces soldiers to the middle of the airstrip where the
INGOs were located.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">The SPLM/A-IO commander then ordered all SPLM/A-IO
forces back  KM in order to reduce the risk of escalation and allow
investigation by CTSAMM.

2.6|The MVT were able to get independent civilian corroboration of the incident,
particularly that the Government Forces came into the area customarily
controlled by the SPLM/A-IO and took the six rifles.

3.0  Assessment

3.1‘It is the assessment of CTSAMM that the alleged clash between Government
Forces and the SPLM/A-IO did occur in Payak Market near Leer airstrip on 19
June 2016.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">It started at the Payak Market, continued to the airstrip and ended
with the withdrawal of SPLM/A-IO forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">

3.2| CTSAMM considers Government Forces were responsible for the incident,
because they entered an SPLM/A-IO area, took rifles and most likely started
the shooting.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">There is, however, no evidence to suggest that it was a deliberate
action sanctioned or ordered by Government Forces commanders.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">

</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">4.0  Conclusion

4.1  </a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">It is the opinion of CTSAMM that the incident happened in Payak village Leer
County Unity State on 19 June 2016 was a violation by Government Forces of
article 1.0  of the PCTSA, specifically:</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">Article 1.1  of the COHA:</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">“The Parties hereby agree to cease all military
actions aimed at each other....”

5.0  Observations and Recommendations

5.1  </a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">This incident happened a long time ago.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">However, there are lessons to be
learnt, specifically that Government Forces must impose discipline on their
troops in order to prevent this sort of incident.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">It was not a major incident, but it
could have escalated into something far more serious.

</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">5.2  </a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">It is vital that all the Government and Opposition forces be made fully aware of
the provisions of the Agreement and ordered to abide by them.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">

</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">5.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">The CTSAMM further recommends that when the situation allows, ‘buffer
zones’ be agreed between the Parties in the Leer area in order to prevent these
types of incident happening.
