EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">Lainya County has faced challenges of insecurity as a result of activities of NAS
in the area.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">Consequently, allegations of Sexual and Gender Based Violence
(SGBV)involving the Parties to the R-ARCSS and ACoH are common due to the
presence of Parties’ forces conducting operations against the NAS forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">

</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">CTSAMVM received an allegation that on the evening of 22 January 2022, at
around 2000hrs, two soldiers suspected to belong to SSPDF Kupera Barracks
entered into the 55 years old woman and started beating up her husband on the
head with a gun butt and then they kicked the victim knocking her to the ground.
</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">After the beating, the two soldiers dragged the victim into the nearby bush and
started raping her.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">Thereafter, the perpetrators robbed her a sum of SSP 50,000
(South Sudanese Pounds Fifty Thousand) and burnt her house with all her
belongings inside, after which one of the suspects moved to the next house
where he raped a 14 years minor girl at about 2200 hrs that same night.
</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">CTSAMVM established that the two rape incidents were reported to the Mundu
Boma Chief Mr Luka Lasu who in turn informed the Commander of SSPDF
Kupera Barracks about the rape cases.</a></p>

perpetrators as Cpl Dominic Ohisa Londu Chiko and L/Cpl Angilo Akuie.

SSPDF Kupera Barracks at about 0500 hrs on 23 Jan 22 after the rape
incidents, they were arrested and put into custody at SSPDF  Bde HQs in
Limbe from where they were later transferred to SSPDF  Bde HQs in Yei
where they are now being detained.

<p><a id="27" name="27">CTSAMVM has reasonable grounds to believe that SSPDF soldiers Cpl Dominic
Ohisa Londu and L/Cpl Angilo Akuie raped a 55 years old woman and a 14
