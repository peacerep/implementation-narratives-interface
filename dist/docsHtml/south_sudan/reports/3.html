Executive Summary 

</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">This Report on the status of implementation of the tasks of the Revitalised Agreement on 
the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) is prepared pursuant 
to Chapter VII, Article 7.9 of the R-ARCSS and covers the period 1st January to 31st March 
2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">This Report therefore, highlights the few accomplishments that were realised during the 
period,  particularly  relating  to  governance  issues,  while  also  stressing  the  stalled 
implementation  of  the  permanent  ceasefire  and  transitional  security  arrangements.  </a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">Much 
remains to be done by the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity (RTGoNU) 
especially  considering  that  less  than  two  years  remain  in  the  Transitional  Period  as  it  was 
previously agreed upon.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">During the reporting period, there was some progress towards the implementation of the 
provisions of Chapter I of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">President of the Republic of South Sudan H.E. Salva 
Kiir completed the appointments of all governors and deputy governors for all ten states.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">This 
was  complemented  with  the  appointments  of  the  State  Ministers,  Advisors,  Independent 
Commissioners and County Commissions.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">However, appointments of the local governments 
in the three Administrative Areas of Abyei, Ruweng and Greater Pibor remain outstanding.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">Of 
concern  is  the  failure  of  the  Parties  to  the  Agreement  to  respect  the  35  percent  women 
representation in the Executive.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">

 </a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">Since the last report, the Permanent Ceasefire has continued to hold despite the volatile 
security situation in the Upper Nile State due to attacks on the SPLA-IO Liang Cantonment 
Site in January by former SPLA-IO forces who defected to the South Sudan Peoples Defense 
Forces (SSPDF).</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">Elsewhere in the country, there have been other attacks on cantonment sites 
and in some cases by armed youth.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">Acts of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) by 
uniformed forces are still occurring, and a CTSAMVM report notes that there had been serious 
crimes committed by some SSPDF soldiers in December 2020 including murder, rape, assault 
and  theft.  </a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">The  attacks  were  conducted  as  revenge  for  the  alleged  attack  by  Thomas  Cirillo 
forces on SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">Cantonment sites and training centres continue to face significant challenges that include a 
lack of food, medicine, clean water, shelter equipment and essential personal hygiene items for 
female  personnel;</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53"> </a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">as  a  result  morale  has  deteriorated.  </a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">The  RJMEC  Interim  Chairperson 
organised  a  site  visit  for  IGAD  regional  ambassadors  and  the  Special  Envoy  to  two  such 
training  centres.  </a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">They  confirmed  the  dire  conditions  at  the  centres  and  issued  a  statement 
calling on the RTGoNU to take urgent action to remedy the situation while noting that the full 
and timely implementation of the transitional security arrangements is intended to underpin a 
stable future for the people and South Sudan, and it is a key part of avoiding repetition of past 
mistakes, and achieving a united, peaceful and prosperous society throughout the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">

</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">The level  of humanitarian need in  South  Sudan  continued to  rise  as  a  result of multiple 
shocks  key  among  which  were  widespread  sub-national  violence,  COVID-19  related 
restrictions, currency depreciation and economic challenges that contributed towards a rise in 
acute food insecurity.  </a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Almost half of the population, 5.82 million people, were projected to 
likely face a crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worsening acute food insecurity and 105,000 catastrophic 

 

  
 iii 

levels  of  acute  food  insecurity  (IPC  Phase5).  </a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">In  response  to  the  growing  needs,  the 
humanitarian  community  launched  the  South  Sudan  Humanitarian  Response  Plan  for  2021, 
targeting 6.6 million people with urgent life-saving assistance and protection by the end of the 
year.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">

</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">Concerning  the  implementation  of  tasks  related  to  resource,  economic  and  financial 
management, not much has been accomplished.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">There was, however, limited progress in some 
areas.  </a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">First,  with  regard  to  economic  and  financial  management,  the  Public  Financial 
Management  Oversight  Committee  is  building  capacity  of  the  government  to  implement  its 
reform  strategy  that  is  aligned  to  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">Second,  the  dissemination  of  the  updated 
annual petroleum reports from the Ministry of Petroleum is a step in the right direction.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">

</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">With regard to Transitional Justice, there has been some progress following the RTGoNU 
Cabinet endorsement of the Roadmap of the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs for 
its  implementation.  </a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">The  Justice  Minister  has  established  a  Taskforce  within  the  Ministry  to 
coordinate the day-to-day implementation of Chapter V, Chapter VI and on Judicial Reform, 
and is awaiting submission of the Memorandum of Understanding on the establishment of the 
Hybrid Court for South Sudan from the Africa Union.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">With respect to the Permanent Constitution-making process envisaged under Chapter VI of 
the R-ARCSS, the RJMEC has scheduled the workshop to take place towards the end of May 
2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">This was made possible following nominations by all the Parties of their representatives 
to  the  workshop.  </a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">During  the  workshop,  the  Parties  are  expected  to  agree  on  the  details  of 
conducting the permanent constitution-making process, which outcome shall form the basis of 
the legislations to be enacted.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">

</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">During the visit to Juba of the Africa Union Peace and Security Council (AUPSC), RJMEC 
outlined to the Council the slow pace of implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">RJMEC also drew 
attention  to  the  spate  of  military  defections  and  growing  inter-communal  violence,  which 
continue to negatively impact on the implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">It also requested that 
the  Council  prevails  on  the  Parties  to:</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77"> </a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">(i)  urgently  reconstitute  the  Transitional  National 
Legislative  Assembly  (TNLA)  and  Council  of  States,  and  complete  appointment  of  State 
Legislative Assembly and lower local government, and to observe the 35% quota for women’s 
representation across the board;</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">(ii) forge ahead with immediate graduation and redeployment 
of the unified forces, prioritize Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR), and 
also to expedite Phase II and the Strategic Defense and Security Review (SDSR) process.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">Further, RJMEC also urged the Council to impress on the RTGoNU to expedite the required 
economic  and  public  finance  reforms,  immediately  establish  the  Transitional  Justice 
institutions, and expedite the permanent constitution-making process.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">Consequently, RJMEC 
recommends the convening of an IGAD Summit to address the exceedingly slow pace of the 
R-ARCSS implementation and to specifically address the issue of unification of forces, among 
others.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">This as the world appeals to the RTGoNU to move the process forward.

<p><a id="85" name="85">This Report on the status of implementation of the tasks of the Revitalised Agreement 
on  the  Resolution  of  the  Conflict  in  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan  (R-ARCSS)  is  prepared 
pursuant to Chapter VII, Article 7.9 of the R-ARCSS and covers the period 1st January to 31st 
March 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">It provides an update on progress or lack thereof since the last reporting period, 
and builds on the previous quarterly reports published since the signing of the R-ARCSS on 12 
September 2018.1 

2.        </a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">Very  little  progress  was  observed  during  the  quarter  as  it  relates  to  the 
implementation of the key outstanding tasks.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">In particular, implementation of the tasks of the 
Pre-Transitional  Period  related  to  the  reconstitution  of  the  Transitional  National  Legislative 
Assembly (TNLA), and the training and redeployment of the Necessary Unified Forces (NUF) 
completely  stalled.2    Further,  outstanding  tasks  relating  to  humanitarian  affairs,  economic 
reforms,  and  transitional  justice  issues  remained  largely  untouched  by  the  Revitalised 
Transitional Government of National Unity (RTGoNU).</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">To be commended, however, is the 
naming of the government at the state and county levels after the Parties successfully resolved 
and agreed on responsibility sharing arrangements.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">Of much concern is the ongoing communal 
violence that threatens the fragile security environment, and which has the potential to derail 
any  possible  gains  from  the  hard  won  peace.  </a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">It  is  therefore  imperative  that  the  RTGoNU 
redoubles  its  efforts  at  implementation  in  order  to  make  further  gains  towards  sustainable 
peace.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">

<p><a id="93" name="93">The Report therefore highlights the few accomplishments that were realised during the 
period,  particularly  relating 
the  stalled 
implementation  of  the  permanent  ceasefire  and  transitional  security  arrangements.  </a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">Much 
remains to be done by the RTGoNU especially considering that less than two years remain in 
the Transitional Period as it was previously agreed upon.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">Also, the Report examines efforts by 
the  Reconstituted  Joint  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Commission  (RJMEC),  cognizant  of  its 
monitoring,  oversight  and  evaluation  role;</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96"> </a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">to  encourage  progress  on  implementation  by  the 
RTGoNU.  </a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">In  the  process,  the  Report  identifies  the  challenges  related  to  transitional  justice 
issues, the humanitarian situation and the economy, and offers a series of recommendations to 
help improve the pace of implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">     

</a></p>

of the R-ARCSS pertaining to  governance, security, humanitarian, the economy, transitional

<p><a id="101" name="101">Previous Quarterly Reports,  which cover progress or lack thereof in implementation of the R-ARCSS since its 
signing in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 12 September 2018, are numbers 001/19, 002/19, 003/19, 004/19, 005/19,

<p><a id="102" name="102">2 The redeployment of the Unified Forces is considered to be critical to preserving the peace in South Sudan by 
aiding the state authorities to get a handle on intercommunal violence and better deal with any security threats 
which may arise in the future.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">This task along with the Reconstitution of the TNLA remain as the two outstanding 
activities  that  were  supposed  to  be  completed  over  a  year  ago  when  the  Pre-Transitional  Period  ended.  </a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">These

<p><a id="110" name="110">At the end of the last quarter, there were a number 
of  tasks  of  Chapter  I  whose  implementation  was  unaccomplished:</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111"> </a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">the  reconstitution  of  the

RTGoNU  for  further  processing;</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115"> </a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">and,  reconstitution  of  the  existing  Commissions  and

<p><a id="117" name="117"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">6. 
 </a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">During  the  period  under  review,  however,  there  was  some  progress  towards  the 
implementation  of  the  provisions  of  Chapter  I  of  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">On  22  January  2021,  for 
instance, President Salva Kiir appointed three Deputy Governors for Warrap, Northern Bahr el 
Ghazal and Central Equatoria states, bringing to nine, the number of Governors appointed and 
a  similar  number  of  Deputy  Governors.  </a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">At  this  time,  the  deadlock  over  Lt  Gen.  Johnson 
Olony’s candidature for the gubernatorial position for Upper Nile state had not been resolved 
and hence the posts for both the Governor and Deputy Governor were vacant. 
7.  </a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">However, following internal consultations by the SPLM/A-IO, Hon. Budhok Ayang Kur 
was identified as a replacement of Lt Gen. Johnson Olony.</a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">Accordingly, on 29 January 2021 
President Salva Kiir appointed him as the Governor for Upper Nile state and Hon. James Tor 
Monybuny  as  his  deputy.  </a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">The  appointments  ended  nearly  10  months  of  deadlock  over  the 
SPLM/A-IO nominee for the governor’s position.</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">Furthermore, President Kiir replaced Gen. 
Bona Panek Biar with Lt. Gen. Aleny Ayieny Aleu as the new Governor of Warrap state.</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">The 
appointment of the Governor for Upper Nile state and the Deputy meant that all the positions 
of the Governors and their deputies for the 10 states in South Sudan have been filled.  
8.  </a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">Of concern, however, is that the gender disaggregation of the executive appointments for 
the Governors and their Deputies shows that 90% of the appointed Governors are male whereas 
10% (01) is female.</a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">With respect to the Deputy Governors, 70% (07) are males whereas 30% 
(03) are females.</a></p>
<p><a id="129" name="129">This means that the Parties, with the exception of the SPLM/A-IO, did not 
strictly observe the nomination requirements of the R-ARCSS concerning women participation 
at the executive level, which should be at a minimum participation of 35 percent (See Annex).3 
The ITGoNU with six (06) positions did not nominate any female Governor whereas SPLM/A-
IO  with  three  (03)  positions  nominated  the  only  female  Governor,  Hon.  </a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">Sarah  Cleto  Rial, 
Governor for Western Bahr el Ghazal.</a></p>

<p><a id="133" name="133">As per Article 1.4.4 of the R-ARCSS, ‘Provisions of the Transitional Constitution of the Republic of South 
Sudan and ARCSS on participation of women (35%) in the Executive shall be observed.’</a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">The nominations for

<p><a id="139" name="139">On  2  February  2021  the  Presidency  made  five  critical  decisions  regarding  the 
implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS,  including:</a></p>
<p><a id="140" name="140"> </a></p>
<p><a id="141" name="141">(a)  on  completing  the  formation  of  the  state 
governments;</a></p>
<p><a id="142" name="142">(b) on unification of the top leadership of the Army Command to pave the way 
for  the  integration  of  forces  into  a  national  single  army  under  a  unified  command,  and  that 
graduation of the first phase of the Unified Forces would be expedited without further delay;</a></p>
<p><a id="143" name="143">
</a></p>
<p><a id="144" name="144">(c) that the First Vice President accompanied by other Vice Presidents and Ministers would 
undertake  a  tour  of  the  different  areas  of  the  country  to  disseminate  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="145" name="145">The 
countrywide  tour  is  intended  to  address  some  of  the  recurring  challenges  associated  with 
freedom  of  access  to,  and  movement  within,  areas  still  under  administrative  control  of  the 
SPLM/A-IO by entrenching the reality of the unity government, with undivided jurisdiction 
over  the  entire  country;</a></p>
<p><a id="146" name="146"> </a></p>
<p><a id="147" name="147">and  (d)  that  the  Transitional  National  Legislature  would  be 
reconstituted on or before 15 February 2021. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="148" name="148">10.  </a></p>
<p><a id="149" name="149">While  the  state  executives  have  been  established  with  the  appointments  of  the  State 
Ministers, Advisors, Independent and County Commissioners, albeit at different times, the rest 
of  the  decisions  reached  by  the  Presidency  on  2  February  are  yet  to  be  implemented.  </a></p>
<p><a id="150" name="150">Also, 
appointments of the local governments in the three Administrative Areas of Abyei, Ruweng 
and Greater Pibor remain outstanding. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="151" name="151">11.  </a></p>
<p><a id="152" name="152">On 26 February 2021, the Parties to the R-ARCSS agreed on allocation of responsibility 
sharing for:</a></p>
<p><a id="153" name="153">(</a></p>
<p><a id="154" name="154">a) the Council of States;</a></p>
<p><a id="155" name="155">(b) Specialized Committees of the Council of States;</a></p>
<p><a id="156" name="156">(c) 
Standing Specialized Technical Committees of the Transitional National Legislative Assembly 
(TNLA);</a></p>
<p><a id="157" name="157">and, (d) State Legislative Assemblies pursuant to the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="158" name="158">By implication, the 
26  February  2021  responsibility-sharing  amends  the  one  of  10  August  2020  where,  for 
example, the parties revised each State Legislative Assembly to 100. 
12.  </a></p>
<p><a id="159" name="159">Furthermore, the Parties agreed that 100 responsibility sharing positions at the Council 
of States would be shared between the ITGoNU, SPLM/A-IO, SSOA, and OPP in the ratios of 
55:27:10:8  respectively.  </a></p>
<p><a id="160" name="160">The  Parties  further  agreed  to  four  (4)  </a></p>
<p><a id="161" name="161">Chairpersons  and  four  (4) 
Deputy Chairpersons of the Specialized Technical Committees of the Council of States as well 
as  26  Chairpersons  and  26  Deputy  Chairpersons  of  the  Standing  Specialized  Technical 
Committees of the TNLA.</a></p>
<p><a id="162" name="162"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="163" name="163">13.  </a></p>
<p><a id="164" name="164">However, the TNLA is yet to be reconstituted because not all Parties have fully submitted 
the  list  of  their  nominees  to  the  NCAC  to  enable  its  reconstitution  to  proceed.  </a></p>
<p><a id="165" name="165">The  NCAC 
received a full list from the Former Detainees (FDs) and a list of 124 out of 128 nominees from 
SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="166" name="166">The NCAC communicated with the SPLM/A-IO to address the gap.</a></p>
<p><a id="167" name="167">Meanwhile, 
the ITGoNU, SSOA and OPP are yet to submit their list of TNLA nominees to the NCAC.   
14.  </a></p>
<p><a id="168" name="168">On 2 March 2021, President Salva Kiir issued another Decree on “Delegation of Power 
to the Governors of ten (10) states of the Republic of South Sudan,” which clarified on some 
of the legal contestations regarding the procedure of appointments of the state governments, as 
reported in the previous week.</a></p>
<p><a id="169" name="169">The Decree indicates that the Governors of the 10 states have 
been delegated the power to swear into office the appointed state officials and that the power 
to  appoint  and  remove  the  officials,  as  provided  for  in  the  R-ARCSS,  is  vested  in  the

Presidency, the Parties and the RJMEC, and that the state authorities, pending the amendments 
of the state constitutions and the Local Government Act 2009, shall exercise their respective 
legal mandate as per the terms of the R-ARCSS. 
15.   </a></p>
<p><a id="170" name="170">On  12  March  2021,  the  Minister  for  Cabinet  Affairs  announced  that  the  RTGoNU 
resolved to establish Malakal as a County and that it would comprise Warjowk, Lilo, Ogodo 
and Wau Shilluk Payams with its headquarters at Wau Shilluk Payam.</a></p>
<p><a id="171" name="171">It was further announced 
that Malakal town comprising Malakal north, Malakal centre and Malakal south would become 
a Municipality in Upper Nile state.</a></p>
<p><a id="172" name="172">The rationale for the decision was that it is a mechanism to 
resolve  disagreements  over  how  Malakal  would  be  governed.  </a></p>
<p><a id="173" name="173">The  decisions  elicited  mixed 
reactions from the public – both in favour of and against.</a></p>
<p><a id="174" name="174">Amidst political dissent, Hon. Francis 
Nyang Awok Ajang was appointed as the Mayor of Malakal, by the Governor.

</a></p>
<p><a id="175" name="175">In  terms  of  legal  and  constitutional  reforms,  mandated  to  the  National  Constitutional 
Amendment Committee (NCAC), under Article 1.18.1 of the R-ARCSS, there has been limited 
progress  during  this  reporting  period.  </a></p>
<p><a id="176" name="176">The  twelve  months  mandate  of  the  NCAC  into  the 
Transitional Period lapsed before the Committee had completed its tasks, including the critical 
review of the NGO Act and the National Elections Act.</a></p>
<p><a id="177" name="177">As a result, the NCAC had requested 
for a minimum of six months extension of its working period to complete its pending tasks. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="178" name="178">The ITGoNU, SPLM/A-IO and SSOA have indicated their agreement to extend the mandate 
of the NCAC.</a></p>
<p><a id="179" name="179">In the meantime, however, the work of the NCAC has been halted, and funding 
may prove challenging going forward. 
17.  </a></p>
<p><a id="180" name="180">By the time the NCAC halted its work, it had completed the review and amendment of 
the Public Finance Management Act and the National Audit Chambers Act, which had both 
been finalised and validated, awaiting submission to the Minister of Justice and Constitutional 
Affairs  for  onward  transmission  to  the  Cabinet  and  TNLA.  </a></p>
<p><a id="181" name="181">They  had  also  embarked  on 
reviewing the Petroleum Act, the Petroleum Revenue Management Act, and the Bank of South 
Sudan Act.</a></p>
<p><a id="182" name="182">and are receiving submissions from relevant institutions.</a></p>

The Security Situation 

18.  </a></p>
<p><a id="185" name="185">Since the last report, the Permanent Ceasefire has continued to hold despite the volatile 
security  situation  in  the  Maban  area,  Upper  Nile  State  due  to  attacks  on  SPLA-IO  Liang 
Cantonment Site in January by former SPLA-IO forces who defected to the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="186" name="186">Sporadic 
attacks on Liang Cantonment Site continued throughout the reporting period, and in some cases 
by armed youth over the appointment of a new Country Commissioner.</a></p>
<p><a id="187" name="187">Of significance, was 
the SSPDF attack on the civilian villages of Luak Wien, Koat Ciethor, and Wunthow and the 
attack  on  an  SPLA-IO  outpost  at  Kedbeck  in  Upper  Nile  state,  which  was  triggered  by  the 
killing of an SSPDF junior officer by unknown armed youth.</a></p>
<p><a id="188" name="188"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="189" name="189">19.  </a></p>
<p><a id="190" name="190">The attack on the SPLA-IO outpost was the first direct SSPDF offensive operation on 
the  SPLA-IO  since  the  signing  of  the  Agreement  even  though  the  SPLA-IO  prevented 
escalation by withdrawing from their position before the attack.</a></p>
<p><a id="191" name="191">Of concern also in Upper Nile 
was the fighting between Dinka and Nuer armed civilians at Anyangnyang, due to cattle raiding 
that resulted in 10 deaths and 11 wounded.</a></p>
<p><a id="192" name="192">In Unity State, armed youth attacked the SSPDF’s 
Awila  Barracks  in  Abiemnom  County,  leaving  one  SSPDF  soldier  dead  and  two  others 
wounded.

20.  </a></p>
<p><a id="193" name="193">However, it is important to point out that during the armed violence in Upper Nile, the 
Joint  Defence  Board,  headed  by  the  SSPDF  Chief  of  Defence  Staff  Lt.  Gen  Johnson  Juma 
Okot, intervened twice and managed to prevent  a potential attack on Akoka by armed Nuer 
youth,  and  also  de-escalated  tension  between  SSPDF  and  SPLA-IO  forces  around  Nassir 
following  the  SSPDF  attack  on  villages,  as  well  as  on  an  SPLA-IO  outpost.  </a></p>
<p><a id="194" name="194">The  SSPDF 
commander whose unit attacked civilians and the SPLA-IO outpost was immediately removed 
from the field pending investigations.</a></p>
<p><a id="195" name="195"> 
</a></p>
<p><a id="196" name="196">21.  </a></p>
<p><a id="197" name="197">Although  fighting  between  the  Parties  to  the  R-ARCSS  (ITGoNU,  SPLM/A-IO  and 
SSOA)4  and the NAS during the period of reporting had significantly reduced since December 
2020,  fighting  was  reported  between  NAS  elements  and  an  SSPDF  unit  around  Morak  and 
Ombasi in the Yei area during March 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="198" name="198">Attacks on SPLA-IO positions by Maj Gen Gabriel 
Moses Lokujo, who defected from the SPLA-IO to the SSPDF in September 2020, significantly 
reduced during the period of reporting.5 However, several cattle keeper related violent incidents 
were  reported  in  Central  and  Eastern  Equatoria,  which  resulted  in  the  deaths  of  several 
civilians.  
22.  </a></p>
<p><a id="199" name="199">The latest unsettling development in Eastern Equatoria has been a series of retaliatory 
attacks  that  are  threatening  the  peaceful  coexistence  between  the  SPLA-IO  forces  in  the 
Lowureng Cantonment Site and local communities.</a></p>
<p><a id="200" name="200">An alleged attack by armed civilians on 
the SPLA-IO Lowureng Cantonment Site led to an SPLA-IO revenge attack on 27 March 2021 
during  which  17  civilians  were  killed  and  several  wounded.  </a></p>
<p><a id="201" name="201">In  response  to  the  escalating 
violence, the Governor of Eastern Equatoria visited the area to facilitate a peaceful dialogue, 
but on 29 March he was ambushed by the local  youth killing one bodyguard and wounding 
others.</a></p>
<p><a id="202" name="202">The situation remained tense at the time of reporting, and CTSAMVM is investigating 
the incidents.</a></p>
<p><a id="203" name="203">It is concerning that incidents of armed youth attacking forces of the Parties to 
the R-ARCSS appear to be on the increase.

</a></p>
<p><a id="206" name="206">During  the  CTSAMVM  Technical  Committee  meeting  held  on  21  January  2021,  it  was 
reported that the two policemen who raped two girls in Maridi were prosecuted and sentenced. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="207" name="207">A report on rape and killing in Lainya area, Central Equatoria, was also presented.</a></p>
<p><a id="208" name="208">In its report, 
CTSAMVM notes that there had been serious crimes committed by some SSPDF soldiers from 
Loka in Gwelinde village on the night of 3 December 2020.  
24.  </a></p>
<p><a id="209" name="209">The  crimes  included  murder,  rape,  assault  and  theft.  </a></p>
<p><a id="210" name="210">The  attacks  were  conducted  as 
revenge for the alleged attack by NAS on SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="211" name="211">The allegation of NAS involvement could 
not be confirmed.</a></p>
<p><a id="212" name="212">Three women were raped and a fourth was stripped naked.</a></p>
<p><a id="213" name="213">All victims have 
received  treatment.  </a></p>
<p><a id="214" name="214">Trend  analysis  by  CTSAMVM  indicates  that  there  were  89  women  and 
girls  involved  in  SGBV  incidents  from  October  2018  to  November  2020.  </a></p>
<p><a id="215" name="215">It  is  critical  to 
continue  to  train  and  sensitize  organised  forces  on  SGBV  issues  as  well  as  to  call  for 
investigation, arrest, prosecution and sentence of perpetrators of SGBV crimes.</a></p>

human rights violations connected to his defection followed by attacks on civilians.’  </a></p>
<p><a id="220" name="220">The EU also stressed that

Cantonment and Training Centres 
25.  </a></p>
<p><a id="222" name="222">Cantonment  Sites  and  Training  Centres  continue  to  face  significant  challenges  that 
include a lack of food, medicine, clean water, shelter equipment and essential personal hygiene 
items for female personnel;</a></p>
<p><a id="223" name="223">as a result, the morale of the forces has deteriorated.</a></p>
<p><a id="224" name="224">In Upper Nile, 
the  Liang Cantonment  Site’s security is  threatened due to  frequent  attacks by defectors  and 
armed youth.</a></p>
<p><a id="225" name="225">In Eastern Equatoria, the Lowureng Cantonment Site was recently attacked by 
unknown  armed  civilians.  </a></p>
<p><a id="226" name="226">CTSAMVM  is  investigating  the  incident.  </a></p>
<p><a id="227" name="227">The  Moroto  Training

<p><a id="228" name="228">In February 2021, the RJMEC Interim Chairperson initiated visits to the Maridi and the 
Rajaf Police Training Centres.</a></p>
<p><a id="229" name="229">Accompanying the Interim Chairperson was the IGAD Special 
Envoy for South Sudan, the African Union Representative in South Sudan and several IGAD 
ambassadors where they witnessed the dire and austere living conditions of the trainees and 
staff.</a></p>
<p><a id="230" name="230">What they witnessed, included the decreasing number of trainees in the centres due to 
large scale desertions as a result of severe hunger, was proof of the continuing dire situation in 
many cantonment sites and training centres across the country.  
27. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="231" name="231">In March, the African Union Peace and Security Council (AU PSC), during its visit to 
Juba, took the opportunity to visit the Rajaf Police Training Centre, where they witnessed first-
hand, the challenges that the trainees and instructional staff face.</a></p>
<p><a id="232" name="232">The challenges, that include 
the lack of food, medicines, accommodation, transport, and a lack of personal hygiene items 
for female personnel, have been highlighted in several RJMEC reports to the RTGoNU and the 
National Transitional Committee (NTC), and yet it appears that little to nothing has changed 
to improve the situation. 
28.  </a></p>
<p><a id="233" name="233">Added  to  the  logistical  challenges  at  Cantonment  Sites  and  Training  Centres,  the 
unification  of  forces  has  since  stalled,  with  no  progress  on  training,  graduation  and 
redeployment  of  the  Necessary  Unified  Forces  (NUF).  </a></p>
<p><a id="234" name="234">The  RTGoNU  has  committed  to 
expedite the unification of forces starting with the formation of a unified command structure, 
but  to  date,  no  apparent  progress  has  been  made  in  that  area.  </a></p>
<p><a id="235" name="235">The  Parties  struggle  to  find  a 
solution  to  the  excess  number  of  senior  officers  in  their  forces,  since  there  is  no  clear

  </a></p>
<p><a id="255" name="255">The level of humanitarian needs in South Sudan continued to rise as a result of multiple 
shocks  key  among  which  were  widespread  subnational  violence,  COVID-19  related 
restrictions, currency depreciation and economic challenges that contributed towards a rise in 
acute  food  insecurity.  </a></p>
<p><a id="256" name="256">Humanitarian  needs  were  compounded  by  violence  and  insecurity  in 
Central and Western Equatoria, Upper Nile, Jonglei and Warrap states, and in the Greater Pibor 
Administrative  Area,  which  left  thousands  displaced  and  in  dire  need  of  humanitarian

<p><a id="364" name="364">These include the following:</a></p>
<p><a id="365" name="365">(</a></p>
<p><a id="366" name="366">a) during the

<p><a id="371" name="371">(d)  there  was  lack  of  prioritization  and  sequencing  of  tasks  by  the  Parties;</a></p>
<p><a id="372" name="372"> </a></p>
<p><a id="373" name="373">(e)  trust-deficit 
between  the  political  leadership  of  some  Parties  resulted  in  deadlock,  which  delayed 
implementation of some key tasks of governance;</a></p>
<p><a id="374" name="374">and (f) incoherence within some parties to 
the  R-ARCSS  mostly  associated  with  the  complexity  of  decision-making  within  party

<p><a id="378" name="378">In particular, security arrangements, which are meant to signify  progress towards 
establishment of the NUF completely stalled.</a></p>
<p><a id="379" name="379">As a result of the lack of unified security forces 
to enforce law and order, as well as addressing intercommunal violence, the newly created state 
governments can do little at present to protect their civilians in terms of ensuring protection 
and  security.  </a></p>
<p><a id="380" name="380">However,  RJMEC  believes  that  the  operationalization  of  the  State  Security 
Committees will be instrumental in addressing these security challenges.</a></p>
<p><a id="381" name="381">In addition, the lack 
of  progress  on  the  DDR  process  will  have  a  significant  detrimental  impact  on  RTGoNU’s 
ability to deal with excess senior officers and soldiers who are not eligible to serve in the NUF. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="382" name="382">Consequently, the onus is on the RTGoNU to quickly complete the graduation of the NUF and 
proceed to redeploy the graduates.</a></p>
<p><a id="383" name="383">This can be accomplished by taking immediate action on 
completing  the  unified  command  structure  and  providing  the  necessary  resources  to  the 
security mechanisms, including for DDR, in order to enable them to complete their work.

(ii) forge ahead with immediate graduation and redeployment of the unified forces, prioritize

<p><a id="394" name="394">Beyond this appeal to the Council, the RJMEC recommends the convening of an IGAD Summit

</a></p>
<p><a id="398" name="398">It is important that the RTGoNU focuses its efforts to increase the pace of implementation 
of the R-ARCSS especially considering that there is less than two years remaining before the 
end  of  the  Transitional  Period  as  envisaged  in  the  Agreement.  </a></p>
<p><a id="399" name="399">Important  issues  related  to 
governance such as the reconstitution of the TNLA and completing the Permanent Constitution 
must  be  resolved.  </a></p>
<p><a id="400" name="400">Also,  the  security  situation  has  to  be  controlled  and  the  NUF  should  be 
trained and graduated.</a></p>
<p><a id="401" name="401">Elsewhere, economic reforms need to be undertaken in order to underpin 
dividends from the peace agreement and transitional justice and humanitarian affairs have to 
be pursued.  </a></p>
<p><a id="402" name="402">Finally, the involvement of IGAD at the highest level will go a long way in steering 
the course for continued peace in the months ahead.

<p><a id="403" name="403">RJMEC on its part shall continue to impartially monitor, evaluate and report as it carries 
out  its  oversight  responsibilities  with  regards  to  the  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS,  and 
intervene  whenever  necessary.  </a></p>
<p><a id="404" name="404">RJMEC  will  also  continue  providing  regular  reports  and 
briefings to the RTGoNU, the TNLA, the Chairperson of the IGAD Council of Ministers, the

Between  February  20,  2021  and  March  2,  2021,  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  South 
Sudan,  H.E.  Salva  Kiir  Mayardit  issued  Presidential  Decrees  appointing  State  Advisers, 
State Ministers, Members of State Independent Commissions and County Commissioners

appointed for the ten States.</a></p>

<p><a id="442" name="442">Conclusion 
In  the  current  appointment  of  State  Advisers,  State  Ministers,  Members  of  State 
Independent Commissions and County Commissioners, women representation in decision 
making positions is below 35%, except for the Adviser positions in Lakes State and Deputy 
Chairperson of Independent Commission in Central Equatoria State. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="443" name="443">The Parties to the R-ARCSS failed to adhere to the 35% quota for women participation in 
accordance with Article 1.4.4 of the Agreement and thus contravened that provision.
