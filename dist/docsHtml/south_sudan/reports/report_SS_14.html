VIOLATIONS IN NASSIR, UPPER NILE STATE
Executive Summary

</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">In the early morning of 31 July 2016 fighting broke out in Nassir.  </a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">Shelling and heavy
machine-gun fire was directed towards the Government Forces camp from SPLM/A-IO
positions south of the river.
</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">Heavy shelling continued the following morning (1 August) and then SPLM/A-IO forces
were seen advancing to the airstrip and market, which they subsequently occupied until
they withdrew on  September following sporadic and at times heavy fighting which
included the deployment of helicopter gunships by Government Forces.  </a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">Despite the
eventual withdrawal of SPLM/A-IO forces there has been further sporadic bombing and
some clashes in the area.
</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">The engagement was initiated by the SPLM/A-IO who moved in and occupied areas —
specifically the market and airstrip — which have for a long time been acknowledged as
firmly under Government Forces control.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">It is the opinion of the JTC that this attack was
a planned aggressive action by SPLM/A-IO forces, and as such it was in blatant violation
of the PCTSA.

VIOLATIONS IN NASSIR, UPPER NILE STATE
1.0  Introduction
</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">1.1     Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">
</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">••</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">On  March 2016 there was a major incident in Nassir involving aggressive
action by Government Forces, which was reported as a violation of the
PCTSA by CTSAMM.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">Since then the situation has remained tense but
relatively calm.

</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">•</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">Following the outbreak of violence in Juba in July tensions increased in the
area, until conflict one again broke out on 31 July.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">

1.2  Incident:</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">On 31 July 2016 an attack by SPLM/A-IO forces developed against the
Government Forces positions in Nassir.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">SPLM/A-IO forces subsequently took
and held the market and airstrip.</a></p>

<p><a id="30" name="30">1.3  </a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">The aim of this report is to outline the details of the incidents and
investigations for JMEC with assessments and recommendations.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">

</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">1.4  Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">

</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">The MVT based at the UNMISS camp at Nassir was able to witness what was
going on.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">The team also had access to commanders of both the Government
Forces garrison and the IO forces involved, and were able to get their comments.
</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">The MVT reported events on a daily basis.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">

2.0  FIGHTING IN NASSIR, UPPER NILE STATE

2.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">On 31 July in the early morning heavy shelling was observed directed at the
Government Forces camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">The MVT contacted the Garrison Commander who
reported that SPLM/A-lO forces were attacking Government Forces positions.
</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">One of the SPLM/A-IO commanders (Major General Peter Ruach), who the MVT
was able to contact, claimed that it was the Government Forces who had started
the fighting.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">The following day there was further shelling and heavy machine-
gun fire;</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">the MVT met with SPLM/A-IO soldiers moving past the UNMISS base
carrying ammunition forward who reported that they had taken the airport and
market.</a></p>

2.2  On  August the MVT was able to contact the SPLM/A-IO commander Major
General Thomas Tut, who told them that the SPLM/A-IO would not stop fighting
until Dr Riek Machar returned to Juba and the Government cancelled the 28
States order.

2.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">Sporadic fighting and shelling continued.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">On  August Government Forces
deployed helicopter gunships which bombed SPLM/A-lO positions in the areas
of the airstrip and market.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">Some SPLM/A-IO troops occupied defensive positions
close to the UNMISS camp in order to avoid being hit by the gunships.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">The
following day the SPLM/A-IO commander Major General Peter Ruach reportedly
ordered his troops to shoot at any aircraft coming into Nassir.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">This subsequently
caused significant resupply problems for UNMISS and the MVT.

2.4— Fighting continued sporadically throughout August.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">The SPLM/A-IO withdrew
from the airstrip and market on  September, but since then there have been
numerous clashes which continue up to this time.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">

</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">

3.1  </a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">It is the assessment of the JTC that this round of conflict in Nassir was instigated
by the SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">They advanced and took ground — specifically the airstrip
and market — that had long been understood to be under the control of
Government Forces.

3.2  </a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">The action by the SPLM/A-IO appeared to be a deliberate and coordinated
assault, with the aim of taking and holding ground vital to the Government Forces
garrison.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">As such it constituted a clear violation of the PCTSA.

</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">4.0  Conclusion

4.1  </a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">It is the opinion of CTSAMM that by attacking Government Forces in Nassir on
31 July 2016 SPLM/A-IO forces violated Article 1.0  of the PCTSA, particularly:</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">

<p><a id="63" name="63">•</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">Article 1.1  of the COHA:</a></p>

actions aimed at each other....”

5.0  Recommendations and observations:</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">

5.1  </a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">This is the second major incident at Nassir in  months.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">The town is dead;</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">all
Civilians fled at the start of the current conflict.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">Despite the peace agreement of
August 2015 the underlying issues that drive conflict in Nassir have not been
resolved.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">There is also no separation of forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">

</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">5.2  Something must be done in order to stop the ongoing clashes in Nassir and bring
peace to the area.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">CTSAMM calls upon JMEC to work at the political level to
find a solution that will be agreeable to all parties, and on JMCC to take positive
action to find local solutions to stop all fighting between the Parties in Nassir and
enable civilians to return to their homes.</a></p>
