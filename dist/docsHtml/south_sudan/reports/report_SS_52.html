CTSAMM MONITORING REPORT FEBRUARY</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">2017
Executive Summary

CTSAMM continues to monitor the parties’ compliance with the PCTSA by conducting
routine and long range patrols.
</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">This report covers the findings of patrols conducted in Western and Central Equatoria
to Kajo-Keji, Mundri, Rimenze and Ezo/Tambura.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">There are consistent and widespread

a    violations of the PCTSA committed by both parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">The impact of this insecurity falls
almost entirely on the civilian population with regular occurrences of rape, looting,
shooting and destruction of property.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">In response to the violence the civilian population
has been forced to leave villages to seek refuge in neighbouring countries, the bush
and IDP camps.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">The inability to farm and harvest crops has added to the overall level
of food insecurity.
</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">There is a grassroots desire for effective peace and reconciliation action which is more
inclusive and allows community participation.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">CTSAMM patrols are welcomed into
communities but it is apparent that relatively few stakeholders understand the role of
CTSAMM or the provisions and responsibilities of the ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">

</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">~
More effort must be made by both parties to seek local solutions to the conflict.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">Those
who perpetrate abuses upon the civilian population must be brought to account.
</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">CTSAMM will continue to conduct patrols to monitor compliance with the PCTSA and
to assess the security situation.

<p><a id="31" name="31">1.0  Introduction
1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">
</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">•</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">According to its mandate, CTSAMM is required to monitor the parties’
compliance with the PCTSA.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">At the CTSAMM meeting of 25 January 2017
JTC presented the findings of monitoring patrols carried out in the previous
month.

1.6  Patrol Methodology

•</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Planning:</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">CTSAMM identifies areas of interest for patrolling.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">All MVT Long
Range Patrols are then planned in detail well in advance of the expected
timeframe.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">The plans are notified to the appropriate bodies through the
Government and IO Liaison Officers

~         ••</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">Composition:</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">The MVT component of patrols is formed from International
Observers, SPLM/A and SPLA/A-IO liaison officers as well as locally
employed Community Liaison Officers.

</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">•</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">UNMISS</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">Involvement:</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">MVT patrols are conducted jointly with UNMISS.
</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">UNMISS provide force protection and often support the patrol with subject
matter expertise.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">

</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">•</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">Interaction with stakeholders:</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">The patrol gathers critical information by
interacting with all stakeholders.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">Formal meetings are arranged with
State/County/Town tiers of government, civil society organisations, faith
groups and security forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">There are also informal meetings with the civilian
population during foot patrols through markets and talking to road users,
schools and businesses.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">The wider the cross section of the community that

“          can be reached then the better the quality of information is collected.
</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">Unfortunately for this reporting period the patrols were unable to have
meaningful dialogue with representatives from SPLM/A-IO.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">Assessment Criteria:</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">Following patrols the teams prepare formal reports with
findings and recommendations which are submitted to CTSAMM HQ.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">The
reports are assessed and the information is used to prepare the CTSAMM
Monitoring Report.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">Only verifiable information is extracted from MVT patrol
reports, the reliability of stakeholders is considered and multiple sources are
required to substantiate allegations of violations.

2</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">. FINDINGS

2.0  Overall Security Assessment    In Western and Central Equatoria there are
frequent and persistent outbreaks of violence in breach of the ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">Both
parties commit infringements with the impact falling on civilians, especially
vulnerable groups such as women, children and the elderly.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">There is insufficient
evidence to identify trends which show whether violence is increasing, levelling
or diminishing.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">There has been extensive civilian displacement and evidence of
the dispersal of males of fighting age into the bush to join the SPLM/</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">A I-O or

-~                 Other Armed Groups (OAG).</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">What is certain is that the security situation remains
extremely tense with the remaining civilian population is living in an environment
of fear and distrust.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">

</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">2.1  Cessation of Hostilities    Violations — are    persistent,    some county
commissioners and Government Forces Commanders claim that there is no
SPLM/A-IO activity in their area and that outbreaks of violence are attributable to
OAGs and criminality.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">Consequently any Government Forces response to violent
attacks is deemed to be a legitimate action and not a violation of the ceasefire.
</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">There are other government representatives who acknowledge the presence of
SPLM/A-IO in their area and seek to conduct low level reconciliation talks.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">In
informal meetings with civilian groups the presence of the SPLM/A-IO is much

~             more readily acknowledged.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">The civilian population fears both parties with good
reason.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">The SPLM/A-IO is perceived to be a threat because they commit
violations in particular the looting of food supplies and abducting of males of
fighting age.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">The SPLA is perceived to be a threat because of the collateral
damage it causes to civilians by its heavy handed reaction to SPLM/A-IO activity.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">

2.2  Attitudes to ARCSS There is evidence that civilian officials and local SPLA
commanders have divergent views towards the ceasefire mechanism.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">Generally
civilian officials and civil societies welcome the presence of CTSAMM and
UNMISS patrols and wish to see more of them.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">On the other hand there are
instances of relatively junior SPLA commanders stating that any

CTSAMM/UNMISS presence is unnecessary and that security needs will be met
by the SPLA.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">It is unfortunate that information on ARCSS and the roles and
responsibilities of all parties has not been passed down to community groups.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">

2.3— Protection of Civilians      There is evidence of widespread abuses especially
in Rimenze and Kajo-Keje.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">During formal briefings monitors are frequently
informed by government officials and security forces that local communities are
safe and protected from harassment.</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">When monitors talk to civilians separately
a very different picture emerges.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">It is apparent that civilian communities are not
reporting abuses to local authorities.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">Monitors received multiple first-hand

a              accounts of rape, looting, abduction, destruction of homes, medical facilities and
murder.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">Where MVTs have been entering town for the first time civilians have
been very willing to talk to monitors and the accounts of multiple abuses indicate
that the situation has been serious from July 2016 until the present.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">There is little
evidence to indicate whether perpetrators of abuse are being held accountable.
</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">Both parties are accused of committing violations but monitors have been
presented with more evidence of abuses by the SPLA and allied militia.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">The most
serious allegations of SPLA abuses are:</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">

</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">•</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">The killing of  men and destruction of dwellings between - Jan in the
Rimenze area.
</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">•</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">The rape of  women in Lobo Village/Kanapo county

ae              •</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">In September 2016 the detainment and torture of youth in the Kajo-Keje

area suspected of being children of SPLA/M-IO soldiers.

2.4  </a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">Displacement of the civilian population Given the frequent outbreaks of fighting
and the level of abuses inflicted on the civilian population</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">it is hardly surprising
that many people have left their home villages to seek refuge in neighbouring
countries , in the bush or in IDP camps.</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">The visible population in some areas
comprises old people, women and small children.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">Many villages are either
sparsely populated or empty.</a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">On major routes and especially at check points
villages are becoming militarised with dense populations of soldiers and heavy
weapons (artillery and tanks) stationed amongst houses.</a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">Some villages have
been completely occupied by the military.</a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">The displacement is ongoing and
MVTs witnessed vehicles heavily loaded with civilians heading towards Uganda.

</a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">The MVTs visited IDP camps in Logo (Liwolo County) and Rimenze which had
estimated populations of 18000 and 5000 respectively.</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">Discussions with IDP
occupants clearly indicated that they felt safer in the camps and felt less
threatened by both Government and SPLA/M-IO forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">

2.5  Humanitarian Access     One of the main drivers for civilian displacement is
concern over food security.</a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">Greater Equatoria has the most fertile land in the
country and when conditions are favourable grow much of the food the local
population requires.</a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">There were many accounts from farmers that they no longer

ite              feel safe going about routine activity, they feel intimidated travelling to their fields
and then returning to heavily protected towns.</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">In extreme incidents SPLM/A-lO
have seized their crops and on returning to their villages farm workers have been
accused of providing support to the same by security forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">Traditional routes
and markets in neighbouring countries have been disrupted by insecurity
problems.</a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">Access to schools, markets and healthcare have been impeded by the
sustained harassment of civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">The insecurity is such that people are
confined to the immediate vicinity of villages for fear of being attacked and
abused.
2.6  Scope for reconciliation      Despite the dire security situation there are
encouraging signs that there is a grassroots desire to end the conflict and to

ams              begin reconciliation and peacebuilding.</a></p>
<p><a id="129" name="129">While there are isolated proponents of a
military solution there is widespread support at state and county level for peace
and reconciliation.</a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">Women’s groups in particular have had enough of the
violence and want to see an energised peace process which is inclusive of all
factions and allows full participation from the communities affected by the
violence.</a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131">

</a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">3.0  Conclusions:</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">

3.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">There is overwhelming evidence that in large parts of Western and Central
Equatoria both parties are failing to comply with the PCTSA.

3.2  Outbreaks of violence in Western and Central Equatoria continue and it is not

possible to determine whether the security situation is escalating, declining or
levelling.

3.3  </a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">The failure to adhere to the COHA and PCTSA is resulting in widespread human
rights abuses being perpetrated on civilians who are weak, vulnerable and
powerless to respond.</a></p>
<p><a id="136" name="136">Those who commit crimes appear to act with impunity and
are unlikely to be held to account.</a></p>
<p><a id="137" name="137">

</a></p>
<p><a id="138" name="138">3.4  </a></p>
<p><a id="139" name="139">The displacement of civilians from border areas and deeper into the country is

a              continuing unabated.</a></p>
<p><a id="140" name="140">The drivers are food insecurity, fear of violence and a loss
of confidence in the peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="141" name="141">

3.5  </a></p>
<p><a id="142" name="142">Despite all the privations endured by the civilian population there is compelling
evidence of a desire at grass roots and local administration level for a
reconciliation and peacebuilding process which is inclusive and community
driven.</a></p>
<p><a id="143" name="143">

</a></p>
<p><a id="144" name="144">4.0  Recommendations

4.1  </a></p>
<p><a id="145" name="145">There should be political dialogue to stop the fighting and to stop the impact upon

~           civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="146" name="146">

4.2  Local opportunities to initiate peacebuilding and reconciliation should be
identified and supported by all parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="147" name="147">

</a></p>
<p><a id="148" name="148">4.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="149" name="149">Clear channels of communication should be opened and maintained with all
factions of the SPLM/A-IO.

4.4  Commanders of both parties should demonstrate a commitment to the protection
of civilians by dealing firmly with perpetrators of abuse and holding them to

account.
4.5| CTSAMM and UNMISS should continue to be supported by parties in the conduct
of routine and long duration patrols especially by ensuring freedom of movement.
