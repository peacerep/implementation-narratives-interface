EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
INTERIM REPORT ON FORCED RECRUITMENT BY THE SSPDF
Towards the end of 2021 CTSAMVM became aware of persistent rumours and
allegations of forced recruitment by the SSPDF in the Bentiu area, specifically in and
around the IDP camp.
</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">Investigations have been hampered by the unwillingness of witnesses to give
information, because they are scared of repercussions.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">However, CTSAMVM has
gathered some witness statements from relatives and from one victim to suggest there
has been forced recruitment in the area.
</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">The SSPDF have denied any forced recruitment, but have said members of armed
groups were flown to Juba for integration into the SSPDF, and that the SSPDF had
been rounding up “deserters”.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">Last October CTSAMVM interviewed ten young men, some probably underage, who
had deserted from the SSPDF base in Nassir.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">They all claimed to have been forcibly
recruited in Lakes State in 2021.
</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">There have been allegations that the SSPDF has been training recruits at Digala, near
Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">CTSAMVM has been denied access to Digala since September 2021.
</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">Any recruitment and training since September 2018 is in clear violation of the R-
ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">Forced recruitment is in clear violation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">CTSAMVM will
continue to investigate this issue and report accordingly.
</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">INTERIM REPORT ON FORCED RECRUITMENT BY THE SSPDF
Introduction
1. Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">

a. Under article 2.1.8  of the R-ARCSS, the Parties agreed to “cease security
forces recruitment and training”.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">Any forced recruitment — IE recruiting civilians
against their will — would not only be in violation of article 2.2.8  but also those
provisions of article 2.3.10  which protect the rights of civilians.

b. Since the signing of the ACOH CTSAMVM has received many allegations of
forced recruitment by the Parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">It had proved to be a challenging issue to
investigate;</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">the Parties are unwilling to cooperate and too often witnesses
unwilling to talk to CTSAMVM for fear of reprisals.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">CTSAMVM was able to
provide a detailed report on forced recruitment by the SPLM/A-IO in Western
Equatoria State (CTSAMVM report 2022/03), however, CTSAMVM has not so
far submitted a report on forced recruitment by the SSPDF.

</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">c. During 2020 there were allegations of forced recruitment in Unity State,
specifically in the Bentiu/Rubkona areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">CTSAMVM undertook an
investigation but was unable to find any evidence it had been taking place.
</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">SSPDF commanders told CTSAMVM that “deserters” or soldiers who had left
the SSPDF to return to their villages had been brought back to their units, but
no actual new recruitment had taken place.

d. Towards the end of 2021 and into 2022 CTSAMVM became aware of more
persistent allegations of recruitment in the Bentiu/Rubkona areas, and in
particular in the IDP camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">On 25 January 2022 the Bentiu IDF Youth Forum
issued a press statement which condemned the “rampant” arrest of young
people by the armed forces.

</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">•. In September 2021 CTSAMVM received allegations from the SPLM/A-IO that
the SSPDF was training “new recruits” in Digala.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">CTSAMVM has so far been

denied access to Digala, and indeed on  February 2022 was turned back at
gunpoint whilst attempting a visit (CTSAMVM Report 2022/06)

f. On 22 September 2021  SSPDF soldiers deserted the SSPDF camp at
Nassir and were held by the SPLM/A-IO in Ulang.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">They all claimed to have
been forcibly recruited by the SSPDF in Lakes State.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">Despite appeals to
various international agencies to take them, the deserters remained in Ulang
until the end of January 2022 when there were sent back home by the SPLM/A-
 authorities.

2. Allegations:</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">The specific allegations covered in this interim report are that:</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">

a. The SSPDF forcibly recruited young men from the Bentiu/Rubkona areas
including the IDP camp and flew them to Juba for training and subsequent
deployment.

b. That the  deserters from Nassir were forcibly recruited in Lakes State, and
furthermore some were underage.

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">Aim</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">:</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">The aim of this interim report is to present initial findings of CTSAMVM
investigations into allegations of forced recruitment by the SSPDF, and to seek the
cooperation of the SSPDF for further investigations.

<p><a id="39" name="39">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">

a. Unity State:</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">CTSAMVM spoke to a range of witnesses between 14 February
and  March 2022 including:</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">

i. The Bentiu IDP Youth Group.
</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">ii.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">GOC  Division SSPDF
iii.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">IDP Camp Joint Police
iv.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">Family members of those recruited.
v. Avictim.
5.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">Upper Nile State:</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">CTSAMVM interviewed  deserters from the SSPDF garrison
in Nassir, all of whom claimed to have been forcibly recruited in Lakes State.
6.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">Limitations:</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">

a. CTSAMVM has found it difficult to find witnesses in Unity State willing to give
information about what is a sensitive issue.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">People are scared of
repercussions.

b. CTSAMVM has been denied access by the SSPDF to Digala where is has
been alleged recruits have been trained.

Findings - Unity State
7.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">The Bentiu IDP Youth Group reported to CTSAMVM that:</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">

a. In mid-January 2022 they received complaints from families of young people
being abducted by security forces at night in the IDP camp.

b. Some young people stopped using the IDP camp library and sports facilities in
the evening for fear of abduction.

</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">c. On 28 January 2022 the Youth Group held a peaceful protest and met with
security forces, who denied they had been abducting young people, but only
rounding up “deserters”.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">The Youth Group were shown no list of deserters.

d. Some business people were abducted, but were later released following the
payment of a fine.

</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">•. They had a list of 11 people allegedly recruited and the names of the family
members who had reported them missing.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">CTSAMVM was given the list.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">CTSAMVM has so far been able to speak with the family members of two
abductees and directly to one abductee:</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">

a. Awoman resident of the IDP camp reported that her 16 year-old nephew (who
has lived with her since 2016) was abducted by the SSPDF with others in
December 2021 whilst shopping in the market at Rubkona prior to returning to
school.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">He was taken to SSPDF '" Division HQ in Rubkona where he was
held overnight.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">The woman tried to visit him at the barracks but was turned
away.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">The boy was flown to Juba the next day.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Some days after that she
heard from a relative that he was in a barracks in Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">The last she heard
from him was on 15 February 2022:</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">he said he had escaped from the barracks
and did not know his exact location and was hiding for fear of arrest but said
he was in Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">He was trying to get back home.

b. A male resident of the IDP camp told a similar story about his 16 year-old
cousin who was taken by the SSPDF in Rubkona in November 2021 and then
sent to Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">The family were shocked but only reported the incident to their
block leader in the camp because they did not trust the Joint Police who they
said were involved in the abductions.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">The last time the man heard from his
cousin he said he was in an SSPDF Barracks in Juba, but he did not know
where.

</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">c. CTSAMVM was able to speak directly to an abductee, albeit by telephone.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">The
young man (age not specified) said he was “recruited” by the SSPDF in
Rubkona market in November 2021, taken to SSPDF " Division and then sent
to Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">He said that he was told by the SSPDF that he was in an SSPDF-
aligned armed group called “Tong” which was being integrated into the SSPDF.
</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">He described how he was flown to Juba with 144 others and taken to an
SSPDF barracks near Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">He was unable to say exactly where the barracks
were.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">He escaped with two others and is currently in Juba.

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">SSPDF:</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">Maj Gen John Maluit Wic Gatyang, commanding " Division SSPDF,
denied that there was any forced recruitment in the area.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">However, he said that:</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">
a. The SSPDF had been collecting deserters.

b. Members of SSPDF-aligned armed groups who had been gathered at Tong
(before it flooded) were being integrated into the SSPDF and had been sent to
Juba.

10.IDP Joint Police Commander:</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">CTSAMVM met with the commander of the Joint

Police in the IDP camp.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">He said that there was recruitment by SSPDF-aligned

armed groups based in Tong last year, and that when the police heard about this

they spoke to the commander and some of those recruited were returned.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">He
claimed that since then there has been no recruitment.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">However, in November

2021 the police received lists of deserters from SSPDF " Division and SPLM/A-

 </a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">Div 4B and accordingly they found and returned these people.

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">The Unity State General Secretary told CTSAMVM that there had been recruitment
by armed groups allied to the SSPDF in Tong before the flooding.

</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">Findings — Upper Nile State

12.In late September 2021  young soldiers deserted from the SSPDF base in

Nassir.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">They were found by armed youths and taken to Ulang where they were

questioned by the senior SPLM/A-IO CID officer.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">They told him they were forcibly

recruited in Yirol and were underage.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">Brig Gen Choul Makuach, the commander of

SPLM/A-IO  Brigade took responsibility for the deserters.

13.On  October 2021 CTSAMVM interviewed all  of the “deserters”, recorded their
names and photographed them.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">It was observed that:</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">

a. Ages and appearance:</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">One of them claimed to be 13 years old, three said they
were 14, four said they were 15 and two said they were 17.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">CTSAMVM
observed that five of the “deserters” looked very young and were probably
under 18, and the other five could have been over 18, but of course it is difficult
to tell.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">Many of them were vague when asked the year in which they were
born.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">One of them, who looked very young and frightened, burst into tears

when he was being interviewed and just said he wanted to go home.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">They were
all in civilian clothes, and claimed they were being well looked after.

b. Origin:</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">Eight of the ten said they came from came from Yirol County.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">One did
not know which county he came from and the other was from Rumbek.

c. Recruitment:</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">They all told the same story.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">The all said they had been ‘forcibly
recruited’ — some said arrested, some said captured — from either their homes
or the fields or bush.  </a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">of them said they had been taken in July 2021, two in
June, one in May and the other was not specific.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">They all said they had been
taken to Juba and kept in “jail” — one said “Jamus barracks” — in Juba until they
were sent to Nassir, where they received two weeks training and were issued
with uniforms and weapons.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">They deserted soon after their training was
complete;</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">they took their weapons but said they left the SSPDF barracks in
civilian clothes.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">None of them wanted to be in the army, and they all wanted to
go home.

14.Maj Gen Justin Nhial Batoang, the commander of the SSPDF Special Operations

Brigade in Nassir told CTSAMVM that the  deserters were indeed from the

SSPDF force under his command, and that they took weapons and sold them to

civilians who escorted them to Ulang County.</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">He went on to say that it is not the

mandate of CTSAMVM to monitor the issues of deserters soldiers who abandoned
their duties, and that this is an internal service matter.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">He said the Commander of

SPLM/A-IO  Brigade should hand them over unless they have joined his forces.

</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">15.The SPLM/A-IO commander and County Commissioner in Ulang asked several
international agencies to remove the deserters and take them back to their homes,
but this did not prove possible.</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">During a visit to Ulang on  March 2022 CTSAMVM
was informed by the County Commissioner that the deserters had been sent home
towards the end of January, but this has not been verified and it is not known how
they were returned.
</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">Interim Assessment

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">It is evident that young men have been sent from Bentiu to SSPDF barracks in the
Juba area.</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">Some of these were from SSPDF-aligned armed groups from Tong
and might have gone of their own free will, but the information gathered by
CTSAMVM so far suggests there has been forced recruitment.

17.</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">The deserters from Nassir appeared desperate to get away from the SSPDF, and
all told stories of forced recruitment and ‘imprisonment’ in Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">Even if they were
not actually forcibly as they stated, the very fact they were recruited and joined the
SSPDF after the signing of the R-ARCSS constitutes a violation of the agreement.

18.</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">It can be difficult to ascertain the exact age of children and young men, but it was
the clear opinion of the CTSAMVM team which interviewed the deserters in Ulang
that at least half of them were under 18.</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">Even if they were wrong about this, they
certainly would have been very young at the signing of the R-ARCSS  years
previously.

Observations and recommendations for further investigations

19.CTSAMVM will endeavour to get more information about forced recruitment in the
Bentiu area, especially first-hand statements from abductees and their families.

20.CTSAMVM needs to understand more about exactly who has been flown by the
SSPDF from Bentiu to Juba, especially the issue of ‘other armed groups from Tong’
being integrated into the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">CTSAMVM will investigate accordingly, and asks
for the full cooperation of the SSPDF.

21.CTSAMVM asks the SSPDF to release the records of the ten Nassir deserters, in
order that their ages and dates of their recruitment can be checked.

22.CTSAMVM has been deliberately denied access to Digala by the SSPDF since
September 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">There have been allegations that training is taking place at
Digala.</a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">CTSAMVM will continue to request support at the political level in order to
gain access to Digala.
