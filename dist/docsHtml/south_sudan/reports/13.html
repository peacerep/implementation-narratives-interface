</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">This Report on the status of implementation of the activities of the Revitalised Agreement 
on  the  Resolution  of  the  Conflict  in  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan  (R-ARCSS)  is  prepared 
pursuant to Chapter VII, Article 7.9 of the R-ARCSS and covers the period 1st October to 31st  
December  2020.  </a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">With  almost  a  year  into  the  Transitional  Period  completed,  the  Report 
highlights the decided lack of progress on the Pre-Transitional activities carried over after the 
initial formation of the Revitalised Transitional Government of National Unity (RTGoNU) on 
22  February  2020,  as  well  as  failure  to  undertake  tasks  scheduled  during  the  Transitional 
Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">During  the  reporting  period,  an  inter-party  committee  continued  with  negotiations  that 
culminated in a partial agreement on responsibility-sharing positions, initialled on 27 October 
2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">Then on 9 December 2020, the Presidency of the Republic of South Sudan, resolved that:</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">
</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">(a) the President appoints the State and Local Governments of nine states with exception of 
Upper  Nile;</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51"> </a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">(b)  the  President  proceeds  to  establish  the  Revitalized  TNLA  and  Council  of 
States;</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">(c) the RTGoNU holds a conference in Juba for the community of Upper Nile state to 
discuss  ways  and  means  of  resolving  any  tribal  or  community  differences  and  to  engender 
harmony in the State prior to a final decision on the appointment of the governor of the State;</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">
</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">and(d) the President shall issue a decree to formalize the above decisions of the Presidency.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">

 </a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">The  National  Constitutional  Amendment  Committee  (NCAC)  has  continued  to  amend 
relevant laws as provided for in the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">These included Public Financial Management 
and Accountability Act, 2011 (amendment)</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Bill 2020 and Southern Sudan Audit Chamber Act, 
2011 (amendment) Bill 2020, which were reviewed and validated.</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">The NCAC also commenced 
the review of the Petroleum Act 2012 and the Petroleum Revenue Management Act, 2013.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">The 
NCAC further reviewed and rectified the discrepancies that were detected in the Constitutional 
Amendment Bill</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">No. 2020 that incorporates the R-ARCSS into the TCRSS, 2011 (as amended) 
and resubmitted  Constitutional  Amendment Bill  No. 8 (2020) to the Minister of Justice and 
Constitutional Affairs.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">The Bill now awaits enactment into law.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">

</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">The Permanent Ceasefire has largely held during the period of the Report.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">However, several 
clashes have occurred between the SPLA-IO and forces of Maj Gen. Lokujo, who in September 
defected from the SPLA-IO to the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">As a consequence, several deaths and injuries were 
reported on both sides during the last quarter of 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">SGBV cases were also reported in some 
parts of  the  country  even  while  community-based  violence  continues  to  be  a  main  cause  of 
insecurity in many of the states.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">

</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">South Sudan continued to suffer the effects of multiple shocks that adversely affected 
the  humanitarian  situation.  </a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">Access  to  the  people  in  need  continued  to  be  hampered  by 
bureaucratic  impediments,  floods,  and  inter-communal  and  sub-national  violence.  </a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">The 
International Rescue Committee (IRC) stated that food insecurity is rising to more than 60 per 
cent amidst large scale displacement of civilians resulting from the effects of years of conflict, 
an economic crisis, recurrent flooding and the COVID-19 pandemic.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">

</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">With respect to the Permanent Constitution-making process envisaged under Chapter VI of 
the R-ARCSS, the RTGoNU has already initiated the permanent constitution making process 
as mandated by the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">According to the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, 
the RTGoNU Governance Cluster has endorsed its proposed roadmap for implementation of 

 

  
 iii 

legal, judicial, transitional justice and constitutional reforms as provided for under Chapter 1, 
Chapter V and  Chapter VI of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">

</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">As  mandated  under  Article  6.7  of  the  R-ARCSS,  the  RJMEC  Secretariat  has  made 
significant progress in preparation towards the convening of the workshop for the Parties to 
agree on the details of conducting the permanent constitution-making process.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">The outcome of 
the workshop shall form the basis of the legislations to be enacted to govern the constitution-
making process.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">

</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">During  the  period  under  review,  the  RJMEC  Leadership  met  with  IGAD  Chairman  and 
Prime Minister of Sudan Hon.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">Abdallah Hamdok in Juba.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">The RJMEC Chairman thoroughly 
briefed the Prime Minister on the status of implementation of the R-ARCSS and the lack of 
progress  in  some  key  areas.  </a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">The  RJMEC  leadership  met  repeatedly  with  H.E  Salva  Kiir, 
President,  Dr  Riek  Machar  Teny,  First  Vice  President,  and  the  four  Vice  Presidents  of  the 
Republic of South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">The RJMEC leadership also held discussions with Nhial Deng Nhial, 
Presidential Affairs Minister on the status of implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">The meetings 
discussed  on  the  need  to  complete  the  power-sharing  arrangements  at  the  state  and  county 
levels, the appointment of the Upper Nile Governor, the reconstitution of the TNLA, and urged 
for the financial support of the NUF and DDR Commission, among others.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">

</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">The  slow  pace  of  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS  is  accompanied  by  a  number  of 
attendant risks and challenges.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">These include growing defections and intercommunal violence, 
which could destabilise the permanent ceasefire;</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">insufficient resources devoted to the training 
and redeployment of the NUF, with the potential to derail unification;</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">failure to complete the 
RTGoNU at all  levels of government;</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">and a prolonged delay  in establishing the TNLA and 
Council of States, which could result in the inability to pass meaningful legislation critical to 
the success of the Agreement.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">Tasks related to Chapters III, IV and V of the R-ARCSS have hardly been addressed adding 
to the terribly slow pace of implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">In fact, with the exception of the proposed holding 
of the permanent constitution making workshop, none of the other activities in Chapter V has 
been attempted.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">Similarly, none of the transitional justice institutions has been initiated and the 
several economic reforms called for in Chapter IV remain undone.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">It is therefore imperative 
that the RTGoNU dispenses with the two Pre-Transitional tasks and commence work on the 
many outstanding Transitional Period tasks.

I. Introduction 

1.     </a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">This Report on the status of implementation of the tasks of the Revitalised Agreement 
on  the  Resolution  of  the  Conflict  in  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan  (R-ARCSS)  is  prepared 
pursuant to Chapter VII, Article 7.9 of the R-ARCSS and covers the period 1st October to 31st 
December 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">It builds on the previous quarterly reports published since the signing of the 
R-ARCSS on 12 September 2018, namely  numbers 001/19, 002/19, 003/19, 004/19, 005/19, 
006/20, 007/20 and 008/20.1 

2.        </a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">The  pace  of  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS  slowed  markedly  during  the  last 
quarter,  with  very  little  progress  made  on  the  implementation  of  the  outstanding  Pre-
Transitional period tasks, related to the reconstitution of the Transitional National Legislative 
Assembly (TNLA), and the training and redeployment of the Necessary Unified Forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">2  The 
Parties,  however,  made  some  much  needed  progress  towards  finally  resolving  the  issue  of 
responsibility sharing at the State and local government levels.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">Ten months into the proposed 
thirty-six  months  Transitional  Period,  much  remains  to  be  done  by  the  Reconstituted 
Transitional Government of National Unity (R-TGoNU) to implement the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">

3.      </a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">Highlighted in the Report therefore, are the efforts undertaken in the fourth quarter by 
the  RTGoNU to  move  the  process  of  implementation  forward.  </a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">This  include  the  tasks  which 
were implemented during the reporting period, those that are ongoing, and others which are still 
pending implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">It examines the ongoing security situation and the challenges to the 
permanent  security  arrangements,  efforts  by  the  RTGoNU to  implement  the  Agreement,  the 
monitoring  and  evaluation  role  of  the  Reconstituted  Joint  Monitoring  and  Evaluation 
Commission (RJMEC).</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">Emphasis is also placed on the continued challenges to implementation, 
particularly related to Transitional Justice issues, the humanitarian situation and the economy.    
4.       </a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">The Report also highlights several areas of concern related to the implementation of 
the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">In particular, lack of progress in completing the reunification and redeployment 
of the Necessary Unified Forces (NUF), a key requirement for the eventual success of the R-
ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">Also  included  is  the  absence  of  any  significant  movement  in  taking  forward  the 
activities in Chapters III, IV and V of the R-ARCSS.  

5.        Section II of the Report will provide greater detail on the status of implementation of 
the R-ARCSS with regards to progress or the lack thereof, and based on the various Agreement 
chapters, Section III presents RJMEC’s observations and recommendations, and concludes with 
Section IV. 

 
 
 

                                                             
</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">1 Previous Quarterly Reports,  which cover progress or lack thereof in implementation of the R-ARCSS since its 
signing in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 12 September 2018, can be accessed at http://jmecsouthsudan.org,. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">2 These two activities along with the responsibility sharing at the state and local government levels were supposed 
to have been completed during the Pre-Transitional Period of the R-ARCSS, which ended on 21 February 2020. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">The Parties to the Agreement however agreed to address them during the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">After almost an 
entire year, with the exception of responsibility sharing the other two tasks remain largely unimplemented.

6.       </a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">During the reporting period, further progress was made by the Parties to the R-ARCSS 
towards the establishment of state and local government authorities.</a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118">An inter-party committee 
continued with  negotiations that culminated  in a  partial agreement on  responsibility-sharing 
positions, initialled on 27 October 2020.</a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">The committee subsequently submitted the agreement 
to the Presidency for endorsement.3</a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">The agreement pertained to all of the ten states with the 
exception  of  the  position  of  the  governor  of  Upper  Nile,  which  remains  vacant. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">Notwithstanding the agreement on responsibility sharing at the sub-national levels, the parties 
did  not  provide  the  list  of  names  for the  various  positions  that  they  agreed  upon  during  the 
negotiation;</a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">and no appointments have as yet taken place.</a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="124" name="124">7.       Under the power sharing agreement completed by the Parties, this position is reserved 
for the SPLM/A-IO’s nominee.</a></p>
<p><a id="125" name="125">The SPLM/A-IO nominated Gen. Johnson Olony for this post 
but the President to date has not appointed the nominee.</a></p>
<p><a id="126" name="126">One of the pre-conditions laid out by 
the  President  for  appointing  General  Olony  was  the  requirement  that  he  report  to  Juba. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">However,  General  Olony  has  yet  to  come  to  Juba,  and  in  December  an  advanced  team 
representing his interests arrived in the capital to hold discussions with government and other 
officials 

8.        </a></p>
<p><a id="128" name="128">At the fourth meeting of the Presidency of the Republic of South Sudan held on 9 
December 2020, they resolved that:</a></p>
<p><a id="129" name="129">(</a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">a) the President appoints the State and Local Governments 
of  nine  states  with  exception  of  Upper  Nile;</a></p>
<p><a id="131" name="131"> </a></p>
<p><a id="132" name="132">(b)  the  President  proceeds  to  establish  the 
Revitalized TNLA and Council of States;</a></p>
<p><a id="133" name="133">(c) the RTGoNU holds a conference in Juba for the 
community of Upper Nile state to discuss ways and means of resolving any tribal or community 
differences and to engender harmony in the State prior to a final decision on the appointment 
of the governor of the State;</a></p>
<p><a id="134" name="134">and(d) the President shall issue a decree to formalize the above 
decisions of the Presidency.</a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">

9.       President  Salva  Kiir  Mayardit  therefore  appointed  six  Deputy  Governors  on  30 
December  2020  as  follows:</a></p>

regarding procedural matters.</a></p>
<p><a id="155" name="155">Some stakeholders expressed reservations and have argued that 
the appointments contradict article 164 (2) of the Transitional Constitution of the Republic of

advisors, and state ministers in consultation with the President and in accordance with the state

Special Envoy to South Sudan who engaged with the groups.</a></p>
<p><a id="201" name="201">The Sant’Egidio facilitated meetings resulted in the 
signing of the Rome Resolution on 11 February 2020 in which the parties to the talks agreed to cease hostilities

<p><a id="204" name="204">Although  minor  clashes  were  reported  between  SSPDF  and  SPLA-IO  forces  in

<p><a id="208" name="208">Of  particular  concern  in  Upper  Nile  has  been  the  establishment  of  unofficial

<p><a id="241" name="241">Significant challenges, including lack of food, shelter, medicines and safe 
water remain evident in most cantonment sites and in some areas, adverse climatic conditions, 
including severe flooding, hindered movement and access of essential life-support resupplies. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="242" name="242">Consequently,  cantonment  site  leadership  is  finding  it  increasingly  difficult  to  maintain 
effective  command  and  control  and  a  significant  number  of  Opposition  forces  have  left 
cantonments in a desperate search for food, water, medicine and shelter.</a></p>
<p><a id="243" name="243">There have also been 
recent reports of some sites being totally abandoned causing concern regarding the cantonment 
of  Opposition  forces  for  Phase  II  of  the  NUF  process.6  As  a  result,  it  has  been  difficult  to 
ascertain accurate figures of the number of ex-combatants who currently remain in the various

<p><a id="248" name="248">Some in-kind support including 
police  uniforms  and  boots  has  been  provided  by  international  partners,  including  Sudan,

Organised Forces;</a></p>
<p><a id="249" name="249">furthermore, the priority for the allocation and distribution of these resources 
remains unclear.

<p><a id="250" name="250">Disappointingly,  the  planned  graduation  and  deployment  of  NUF  from  training 
centres has not yet materialised due to a lack of funding, no clear agreement on the organization 
and command structures between the Parties, and no publication of deployment plans.</a></p>

bureaucratic impediments, floods, and inter-communal and sub-national violence.</a></p>

<p><a id="291" name="291">Floods  at  the  end  of  the  fourth  quarter  2020,  the  International  Rescue  Committee 
(IRC)  stated  that  Food  insecurity  is  rising  to  more  than  60  per  cent  amidst  large  scale 
displacement  of  civilians  resulting  from  the  effects  of  years  of  conflict,  an  economic  crisis, 
recurrent flooding and COVID-197.</a></p>
<p><a id="292" name="292">According to the IRC’s 2021 Watchlist, the risk of famine 
will  increase  even  more  in  2021.  </a></p>
<p><a id="293" name="293">The  IRC  is  calling  for  a  scale-up  in  international  financial 
support  and  improvements  in  access  for  food  assistance  for  South  Sudan  to  prevent  famine. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="294" name="294">However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  capacity  of  development  partners  for  financing 
development assistance has been negatively  impacted by the  international economic crisis  in 
the wake of the  COVID-19 Pandemic.</a></p>

than  US  $30  during  the  second  quarter  of  the  year.  </a></p>
<p><a id="297" name="297">However,  in  the  case  of  South  Sudan, 
increased oil revenues do not translate into comparable increases in financing available for new 
spending.</a></p>
<p><a id="298" name="298">This is mainly because part of the higher oil revenues are earmarked to pay back oil 
advances taken up when the oil price plunged in the first half of 2020, and to pay accumulated

the Parties to seek continuous compromise towards  the  implementation of the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="401" name="401">In 
addition,  it  leaves  a  void  at  the  highest  level  of  state  government,  which  could  encourage 
continued  insecurity  that can work against achieving  lasting peace.</a></p>
<p><a id="402" name="402">At the national  level, the  
Parties, for the most part, have failed to submit nominees to the TNLA as per Article 1.14.2 of 
the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="403" name="403">The Parties are urged to immediately complete the nomination process and allow 
for expansion and reconstitution of Parliament, without any further delay.</a></p>

<p><a id="405" name="405">With  almost  a  year  having  being  expended  during  the  Transitional  Period,  the 
RTGoNU  is  still  struggling  with  completion  of  outstanding  Pre-Transitional  tasks  and  in 
particular that of graduation and redeployment of the NUF, and reconstitution of the TNLA and 
the COS.</a></p>
<p><a id="406" name="406">What was originally  intended to be a  forty-five-day training exercise turned  into a 
more  than  14-month  ordeal  to  date  for  the  unification  of  forces.  </a></p>
<p><a id="407" name="407">Of  growing  concern  is  the 
chronic shortage of food and medicines and the increasing number of forces leaving the camps 
in search of food.</a></p>
<p><a id="408" name="408">

      </a></p>
<p><a id="409" name="409">It  is  strongly  recommended  that  the  RTGoNU  make  available  the  necessary 
resources to graduate and redeploy the forces remaining at the centers and to embark on Phase 
2 of the planned training.</a></p>
<p><a id="410" name="410">Further, coordination of the security arrangements remains  lacking 
and  it is now  imperative that DDR is given the necessary  focus and priority at the  RTGoNU 
Presidency  and  Governance  Cluster  levels  to  avoid  a  disconnect  between  Phase  I  NUF 
graduation and deployment and ensure effective management of those ex-combatants who are 
selected, or opt, for DDR.</a></p>
<p><a id="411" name="411">Failure to immediately address the situation could very well result in 
the unravelling of the Permanent Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements (PCTSA).

<p><a id="413" name="413">RJMEC is rightly concerned by the continuing denial of access of UNMISS personnel

<p><a id="414" name="414">The  Parties  to the  Agreement  must  be 
reminded  that  this  is  a  prohibitive  action  of  the  R-ARCSS  and  in  clear  violation  of  Article 
2.1.10.6 of the R-ARCSS, pertaining to their obligations.</a></p>
<p><a id="415" name="415">Parties must comply with all articles

<p><a id="420" name="420">Its important to note that episodes of SGBV violence are clear violations of the 
R-ARCSS, and those engaged in such acts will continue to be subjected to the course of justice. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="421" name="421">In that regard, efforts of the SSPDF leadership to prosecute those found committing such acts 
are commendable.</a></p>

<p><a id="423" name="423">Tasks related to Chapters III, IV and V of the R-ARCSS have hardly been addressed 
adding to the terribly slow pace of implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="424" name="424">In fact, with the exception of the proposed 
holding of the permanent constitution making workshop, none of the other activities in Chapter 
V were attempted.</a></p>
<p><a id="425" name="425">Similarly, none of the transitional justice institutions were initiated and the 
several economic reforms called for in Chapter IV remain undone.</a></p>
<p><a id="426" name="426">It is therefore imperative that 
the RTGoNU dispenses with the two Pre-Transitional tasks and commence work on the many 
outstanding Transitional Period tasks.</a></p>

<p><a id="428" name="428">Concerning  the  implementation  of  Chapter  V,  the  Ministry  of  Justice  must  be 
commended for initiating the process by seeking approval from the  Governance Cluster for the 
proposed implementation of legal, judicial, transitional justice and constitutional reforms as it 
relates to the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="429" name="429">Now what remains is for the Ministry of Justice to initiate engagement 
with  the  UN,  AU  and  African  Commission  on  Peoples  and  Human  Rights  (ACPHR)  with  a 
view to identifying areas of support and collaboration.</a></p>
<p><a id="430" name="430">In addition, RTGoNU should support 
efforts  to  fast  track  the  establishment  of  the  Hybrid  Court  of  South  Sudan  and  engage  on 
complementary transitional justice mechanisms, with concerned partners.</a></p>

<p><a id="433" name="433">Conclusion 

68.       </a></p>
<p><a id="434" name="434">Urgent attention must necessarily be paid by the RTGoNU to the overwhelmingly 
slow pace of implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="435" name="435">With almost a year of the three-year transitional 
period having expired, it is imperative to reconstitute the TNLA and complete the unification 
of  forces,  the  two  remaining  activities  meant  to  have  been  performed  during  the  Pre-
Transitional  Period.  </a></p>
<p><a id="436" name="436">Completion  of  both  tasks  will  help  lay  the  foundation  for  increased 
stability and the ultimate success of the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="437" name="437">At this juncture it is imperative to witness 
a renewal of efforts towards implementation of the Agreement, on the part of RTGoNU, the 
Parties, other stakeholders, and the regional and international communities.</a></p>
<p><a id="438" name="438">This call for urgent 
action  is  all  the  more  important  given  the  fact  that  millions  of  IDPs  and  refugees  are  still 
yearning to return to a country that is stable, and on a strong path of reforms;</a></p>
<p><a id="439" name="439">all of which are 
provided for in the R-ARCSS.  

69.  RJMEC on its part shall continue to impartially monitor, evaluate and report as it carries 
out  its  oversight  responsibilities  with  regards  to  the  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS,  and 
intervene  whenever  necessary.  </a></p>
<p><a id="440" name="440">RJMEC  will  also  continue  providing  regular  reports  and 
briefings to the RTGoNU, the TNLA, the Chairperson of the IGAD Council of Ministers, the 
Chairperson of the African Union Commission, the AU Peace and Security Council, and to the 
UN Secretary-General and the United Nations Security Council.</a></p>
