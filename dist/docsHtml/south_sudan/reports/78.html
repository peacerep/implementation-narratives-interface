1.0  Introduction

1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">The overall situation in the Bentiu area had been relatively calm since the
formation of the TGoNU, and during and after the fighting that took place in
Juba in July both sides declared their intention to maintain the peace.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">There
had, however, been continued clashes in southern Unity State which created
tension.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">It became apparent that Government authorities wanted Government
Commissioners in the counties of the newly-created Norther Liech state, and
the Commissioner appointed to Jezeera in Kaljaak County mobilised a force
of -300 youths from the Nhialdiu area as a preliminary move.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">A few days prior to the fighting in the Jezeera area a delegation from the new
First Vice President had been in the area, which culminated in a joint rally
with the Acting Governor of what is knownas Norther Liech State (John Joal)
on 19 September.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">On 21-22 September Government Forces evacuated Nhialdiu.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">No reason
was given.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">The SPLM/A-IO Commissioner, Peter Lok Tang, advised NGO’s
to leave the area as he stated he had credible information that Government
Forces were preparing to attack the Jezeera area.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">SPLM/A-lO positions
along the Pakur road to Jezeera from Rubkona including Ding Ding, Dhorbor
and Kaljaak were well-established, well-known to Government Forces and
had been generally acknowledged as being under the control of the SPLM/A-
10.

1.2.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">Incident:</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">Starting on 25 September Government-aligned youths supported by
Government Forces attacked SPLM/A-IO positions in the Jezeera area.

1.3  Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">The aim of this report is to outline the details of the incidents and
investigations for JMEC with assessments and recommendations.

1.4  Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The MVT based in Bentiu has good communications with both
sides and many sources of local information.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">They were able to monitor the
situation as it developed, and physically witness some of the movements of
Government Forces.

2.0  FIGHTING IN THE JEZEERA AREA, UNITY STATE

2.1  On 25 September fighting broke out towards Jezeera.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">Government-aligned
youths supported by Government Forces attacked well-established SPLM/A-lO
positions.

2.2  Initial reports suggested that the SPLM/A-IO has repulsed attacks against Ding
Ding, but by 27 September Government Forces were in control of Jezeera and
Kaljaak, and reports suggested they were pushing on to Buaw in Koch County
as well.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">The Acting Governor of what is known as Northern Liech State
confirmed to the MVT that after allegedly trying to persuade the SPLM/A-IO
Commissioner Peter Lok Tang to embrace peace, a decision was taken to “chase
the SPLM/A-IO from the area”.

2.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">All the evidence collected by the MVT suggests that the Government Forces
attacks against the SPLM/A-IO positions were deliberately planned.

3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">

3.1  Itis the assessment of the JTC that Government Forces prosecuted a deliberate
operation to eject SPLM/A-IO forces from the Jezeera area in Kaljaak County.

3.2  The political situation in Unity State has been made more complex following the
events of July, but this does not alter the fact that Government Forces took
deliberate aggressive actions against SPLM/A-IO forces.

4.0  Conclusion

4.1  It is the opinion of the JTC that in attacking SPLM/A-IO Forces in Kaljaak County
Government Forces were in clear violation of Article 1.0  of the PCTSA,
particularly:</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">Article 1.1  of the COHA:</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">“The Parties hereby agree to cease all military
actions aimed at each other....”

5.0  Recommendations and observations:</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">

5.1  The situation in Unity State is volatile.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">This volatility has been exacerbated by
recent political events.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">It is vital that the situation is stabilised in order for the
peace process to continue and its provisions implemented.

5.2  The JTC recommends that JMEC works with the TGONU to find some formula at
the political level which will bring down tensions in Unity State in general and the
area around Bentiu/Rubkona in particular.

5.3  The JMEC further recommends that JMCC works to freeze all forces in place
and stop any aggressive action by the Parties whatever the provocation.
