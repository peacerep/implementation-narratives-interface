Executive Summary 

</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">This  Report  which  covers  the  period  from  December  1st,  2017  to  March  31st, 
2018 highlights the status of implementation of the Agreement on the Resolution 
of Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (ARCSS) and the ongoing High Level 
Revitalization  Forum  (HLRF)  convened  by  The  Intergovernmental  Authority  and 
Development  (IGAD)  in  an  effort  to  revitalize  implementation  of  the  Peace 
Agreement.  </a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The  report  presents  observations  and  makes  recommendations 
pursuant to the current peace process in South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">

</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">The  HLRF  was  mandated  to:</a></p>

<p><a id="24" name="24">(a)  agree  on  concrete  measures  to  restore  the

</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">The  first  phase  of  the  HLRF,  which  took  place  in  Addis  Ababa,  Ethiopia  from 
December 5th – 21st, 2017 resulted in the signing of an Agreement on Cessation 
of Hostilities, Protection of Civilians and Humanitarian Access (CoHA).</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">This was 
quickly followed by a workshop aimed at clarifying responsibilities and equipping 
the  parties  with  the  requisite  tools  to  implement  critical  provisions  of  the 
Agreement.  </a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">It  also  developed  specific  modalities  that  would  enable  full

deliberations at the HLRF.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">Deliberations were also held on Chapters I and II of 
the ARCSS.</a></p>

displaced, 2.4 million of whom have taken refuge in neighbouring countries.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Food 
insecurity  is  widespread.  </a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">It  is  reported  by  the  United  Nations  Office  of  the 
Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs  (UN-OCHA)  that  5.3  million  people  are 
currently  food  insecure,  with  at  least  one  million  those  estimated  to  be  on  the 
brink of famine.</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Compounding the situation, problems continue to be faced with 
respect  to      the  protection  of  civilians  and  access  to  humanitarian  aid  and 
services  to  those  most  in  need.  </a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">On  a  positive  note,  a  cholera  outbreak,  which 
broke out in 2017 was declared over in February 2018.</a></p>

<p><a id="62" name="62">Regrettably  the  economy  continues  to  experience  a  noticeable  decline 
compounded  by  high  inflation  and  a  deteriorating  exchange  rate.  </a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">On  the  fiscal 
front  TGoNU’s  revenues  are  being  severely  affected  as  it  seeks  to  pay  down 
arrears due to the government of Sudan under the Oil Agreement, thus placing a 
tremendous  burden  on  the  government’s  ability  to  meet  its  other  spending 
obligations.  </a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">In that regard, an attempt to increase non-oil revenue through the 
establishment of a Revenue Authority is a welcome first step in  addressing the 
issue.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">Overall implementation of Chapter IV is hindered by insufficient resources, 
failure to update key legislation, and in some cases a lack of political will, which 
have served to severely constrain progress.</a></p>

</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">Serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law continued 
through 2017 and early 2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">Some of the most egregious violations reported by 
the  Commission  on  Human  Rights  for  South  Sudan  in  March  2018  include 
targeted  killings,  the  recruitment  of  children  by  armed  groups;</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69"> </a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">rape  and  gang 
rape of children, women and men, looting and destruction of property.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">The near 
total absence of accountability for these crimes has encouraged their continued 
perpetration.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">Accountability measures and mechanisms proposed in Chapter V of 
the ARCSS are yet to be established.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">Impunity has become entrenched thereby 
complicating prospects for healing and reconciliation.</a></p>

The Chairperson  of  the  JMEC  continued  his  engagement  with  the  TGoNU, 
particularly  with  H.E.  Salva  Kiir  Mayardit,  President  of  the  Republic  of  South 
Sudan and H.E. General Taban Deng Gai, the First Vice President.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">There was also 
engagement  in  further  diplomatic  missions  with  the  leadership  of  the  United 
Nations, the African Union Commission (AUC), IGAD, and the various dedicated 
Special Envoys, all with the intention of finding a path out of the current crisis.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">

</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">The success of the revitalization process is hugely dependent on the exercise of 
political will by the South Sudanese Parties and their willingness to compromise. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">IGAD must remain actively engaged during and in-between sessions of the HLRF 
at  the  highest  level.  </a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">Much  has  been  achieved  already,  and  IGAD,  AU  and  the 
United  Nations  should  work  collaboratively  with  the  parties  to  ensure  that 
momentum for dialogue is not lost.

of Heads of State and Government of  June 12th, 2017 agreed to convene 
a  High-Level  Revitalization  Forum  (HLRF)  of  the  parties  to  ARCSS, 
including  estranged  groups,  with  the  key  objectives  of:</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91"> </a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">(a)  agreeing  on

<p><a id="96" name="96">

</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">The Summit mandated the IGAD Council of Ministers to urgently convene 
and facilitate the HLRF.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">JMEC and IGAD Secretariat were tasked to provide 
the necessary secretariat and logistical support to the HLRF process.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">H.E 
Dr. Ismail Wais was also appointed the Special Envoy for South Sudan and 
mandated  by  the  IGAD  Council  of  Ministers  to  coordinate  the  process.

<p><a id="108" name="108"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">During the first phase of the Forum, deliberations focused on achieving a 
cessation of hostilities and culminated in the signing of an Agreement on 
Cessation  of  Hostilities,  Protection  of  Civilians  and  Humanitarian  Access 
(CoHA) on December 21st, 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">The signing of the CoHA was witnessed 
by  other  South  Sudanese  stakeholders,  regional  guarantors,  and  others

reduction of fighting even though violations have occurred.</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112"> 

</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">Related  to  the  implementation  of  the  CoHA,  a  follow-up  workshop 
facilitated  by  JMEC  and 
the  Ceasefire  and  Transitional  Security 
Arrangement Monitoring Mechanism (CTSAMM) was held on January 24th - 
25th,  2018,  in  Addis  Ababa,  Ethiopia  with  the  aim  of  clarifying 
responsibilities  and  equipping  the  parties  with  the  requisite  tools  to 
implement  critical  provisions  of  the  Agreement.  </a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">The  workshop  also 
developed specific modalities that would enable full implementation of the 
CoHA.</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">

</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">The second phase of the Forum, convened from February 5th – 16th, 2018, 
kicked  off  with  deliberations  on  the  Declaration  of  Principles  (DoP)  to 
guide  the  dialogue.  </a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">The  Forum  deliberated  on  governance  (Chapter  I  of 
the  ARCSS);</a></p>
<p><a id="118" name="118"> </a></p>
<p><a id="119" name="119">and  Permanent  Ceasefire  and  Transitional  Security 
Arrangements  (Chapter  II  of  the  ARCSS).  </a></p>
<p><a id="120" name="120">The  outcomes  of  the 
deliberations  included  full,  partial  and  pending  agreements  on  provisions 
of the articles of the DoP as well on chapter I and II of the ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="121" name="121">The 
parties agreed on 27 principles of the DoP but TGoNU objected to principle 
28  on  accountability  for  spoilers  and  violators  and  consequently  did  not 
sign the DoP.  

On  chapter  I,  the  Parties  deliberated  and  agreed  on  the  mandate  of  a 
restructured  TGoNU;</a></p>

<p><a id="123" name="123">the  establishment  and  expansion  of  Transitional

<p><a id="125" name="125">There was partial

National Constitutional Amendment Committee (NCAC).</a></p>

42.  </a></p>
<p><a id="317" name="317">Much  rests  on  the  successful  conclusion  of  the  HLRF  and  an  urgent 
resolution to the conflict in South Sudan, which is a necessary condition to 
consolidate economic stability and begin the huge task of creating broader 
economic  growth  and  development.  </a></p>
<p><a id="318" name="318">The  economy  of  South  Sudan  and 
ultimately  its  people  can  only  truly  begin  to  experience  meaningful 
development  in  the  absence  of  war  and  in  a  focused  effort  to  stimulate 
agriculture production, improve oil and other revenue sources, and expand 
the private sector’s role in development.

<p><a id="319" name="319">

</a></p>
<p><a id="320" name="320">Inflation,  deterioration  of  the  exchange  rate,  and  subdued  oil  revenues 
loom  as  major  threats  to  the  economic  stability  of  the  country. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="321" name="321">Consequently,  continuing  efforts  by  TGoNU  to  improve  and  streamline 
expenditure  management,  eliminate  the  fuel  subsidy,  consolidate  and 
reduce domestic arrears, establish the NRA, enact appropriate legislation, 
and limit borrowing from the Central Bank can have the impact of further 
improving economic stability and setting the stage for future growth.</a></p>

<p><a id="323" name="323">Going  forward,  successful  implementation  of  Chapter  IV  of  the  Peace

strengthen  the  economic  policy  framework,  and  aggressively  pursue  its
