CTSAMVM REPORT 2021/03
DENIAL OF ACCESS TO CTSAMVM IN WARRAP AND EASTERN EQUATORIA
STATES ON  and 11 MARCH 2021

</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">a.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">On  March 2021 CTSAMVM Sector  based in Wau made arrangements to
visit 11 Division SSPDF in Warrap on 11 March 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">The aim of the visit was
to establish the facts about this division, which according to information given
to CTSAMVM had only recently been formed.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">This task had been given to
CTSAMVM Sector III following discussions at a CTSAMVM Joint Monitoring
and Coordination Office (JMCO) meeting on  March 2021.

</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">b. CTSAMVM Sector III personnel did all the usual coordination, however when
they contacted the commander of 11 Division, Major General Zacharia Akoli,
on  March, he refused to meet them stating that he would only do so if
authorised by the SSPDF Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">This authorisation
was not forthcoming despite the efforts of the CTSAMVM SSPDF Senior
National Liaison Officer (SNLO), and CTSAMVM was therefore denied access
to 11 Division SSPDF and prevented from discharging its monitoring and
verification functions.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">

c. CTSAMVM visited Kuajok on 11 March 2021 in order to discuss the matter
with the Governor of Warrap State, but he was away from his office at the time.

2.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">Eastern Equatoria State:</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">

</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">a. The CTSAMVM MVT based in Torit undertook a Long Duration Patrol (LDP) to
Magwi and Obama Kit from  — 12 March 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">The aim of the patrol was to
investigate allegations of recruitment and training in these areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">The patrol
had been planned in February 2021 and out of courtesy the Commander of 
Division SSPDF had been informed.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">On  March 2021 the MVT met with the
commander of  Brigade SSPDF based in Magwi, Brigadier Kulang, who was

fully cooperative and suggested the MVT visit River Kimarou which was one of
the areas in Magwi where it had been alleged SSPDF recruitment and training
had been taking place.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">

</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">On 11 March 2021 the MVT was in Magwi town waiting to leave for River
Kimarou when Captain Edward Mzee from  Brigade SSPDF said that the
team needed to see “the chief” before travelling to River Kimarou.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">He escorted
the MVT to a compound on the edge of the town, and at about 10.30  Hrs
Colonel Thomas Odour, the Chief Intelligence Officer at  Div SSPDF arrived.
</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">He was very aggressive and shouted at the MVT, asking them what they were
doing.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">When they tried to explain, Colonel Odour interrupted them and told
them to go back to Torit and “follow procedures like UNMISS and JVMM do’.
</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">The CTSAMVM SSPDF National Monitor tried to explain the situation to
Colonel Odour but to no avail.

</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">Assessment

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">CTSAMVM Sector Ill followed all the usual procedures before calling Major
General Zacharia Akoli.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">CTSAMVM does not need authorisation from CDF to
visit a divisional headquarters, and indeed CTSAMVM teams visit divisional
headquarters throughout the country as a matter of routine on a regular basis.
</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">There is no reason that 11 Division SSPDF should be any different.

4.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">The commander of 11 Division SSPDF, Major General Zacharia Akoli, must have
either been ignorant of the provisions of the ACOH and R-ARCSS, or he
deliberately denied access to CTSAMVM.

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">Colonel Odour, the Chief of Military Intelligence at  Division SSPDF who denied
CTSAMVM access to River Kimarou had been a National Monitor with
CTSAMVM.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">He must, therefore, be fully conversant with all the articles of the
ACOH and R-ARCSS that guarantee CTSAMVM freedom of movement and
access, and it can therefore be concluded that this was a deliberate denial of
access.

6.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">CTSAMVM does not know why the SSPDF thought it necessary to deny access
on these two occasions, but in both instances routine CTSAMVM operations
were prevented from taking place.                                                 ,

</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">Conclusion

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">By deliberately denying CTSAMVM access to 11 Division SSPDF on  March
2021 and to River Kimarou on 11 March 2021, the SSPDF acted in clear violation
of:</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">

freedom of movement and unhindered access mean.</a></p>
