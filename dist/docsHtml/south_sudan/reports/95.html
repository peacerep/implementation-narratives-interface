<p><a id="61" name="61">11.The attack on the afternoon of 20 June 2021 was stated  by the County
Commissioner and SSNPS to have been conducted by a “White Army” group of
armed civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">This is disputed by the Deputy Commander of the SSPDF
Special Brigade (Brig Gen Salvakir Ahmed) who stated that the criminals are not
White Army, but are SPLM/A-IO and it is they who are responsible for the killings
in Nassir.
12.On the evening of 20 June 2021 witnesses heard heavy and continuous gunfire
from the direction of Kedbek.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">SSNPS then received information that there had

</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">14.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">Relations between SSPDF and SPLM/A-IO in Nassir county are not cordial.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">For
this reason, the forces are Separated with the SSPDF in Nassir town and
a
SPLM/A-IO in the suburbs, chiefly Kedbeck.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">It is recognised that each party
controls separate areas.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">The SPLM/A-IO in  Kedbeck have no permanent
barracks and few facilities The nearest cantonment site is at Torpuot which is
suffering from severe shortages of food.
</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">Assessment
15.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">The incidents which led to the deaths of an SSPDF officers and a civilian woman
on 11 May 2021 and 20 June 2021 in Nassir were because of an attack by armed
civilians referred to as “White Army”.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">The assertion by Brig Gen Salvakir Ahmed
SSPDF that the SPLM/A-IO were responsible for the attack is not sustainable.
</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">The County Commissioner, SSNPS and local leaders all attest to the existence of
the White Army who are active in Nassir County and said it was they who
perpetrated the attacks.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">They have a history of committing violent attacks and
stealing weapons.
16.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">The incident on 12 May 2021 which resulted in the death of an SSPDF officer
and a civilian was the result of an internal dispute within SSPDF.
</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">17.There was an attack on SPLM/A-IO forces and civilians at Kedbeck on the
evening of 20 June 2021.The attack was conducted by SSPDF from Nassir, most
probably as an act of revenge for the incidents perceived to have been committed
by criminals associated with the SPLM/A-IO earlier on the same day in Nassir.
</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">The attack was similar to that which took place on 15 March 2021.
</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">18.The attack on Kedbeck on 20 June 2021 resulted in the death of an innocent
civilian, destruction of property and harassment of women.
19.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">The main driver of insecurity in Nassir County is the presence of youth who are
attacking SSPDF, SPLM/A-IO, SSNPS and civilians in order to acquire weapons.
</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">Conclusion                              f
20.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">It is the conclusion of CTSAMVM that by attacking the SPLM/A-IO base and
destroying civilian dwellings in Kedbeck the SSPDF acted in clear violation of the
R-ARCSS, specifically Article 2.1.9:</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">“No revenge, vengeance or retribution and
any kind of violation of the Permanent Ceasefire is allowed under any
circumstances.”

21.The action of SSPDF caused the killing of innocent civilians on 11 May and 20
June 2021 in Nassir and Kedbeck respectively, and the destruction of civilian
dwellings.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">The SSPDF has failed to fulfil its obligations to protect civilians as
required by Articles ,  and  of the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities 24
December 2017 as incorporated into Article 2.2.10  of the R-ARCSS.

Observations and Recommendations

22.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">The incident is the second such attack conducted against SPLM/A-IO positions in
Kedbeck in 2021.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">As a result of the previous attack the JDB investigated and took
Steps to remove the commander of the SSPDF garrison in Nassir.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">It is
recommended that JDB now take further steps to resolve the tensions which
continue to cause insecurity.

23.The evident lack of discipline displayed by the SSPDF in Nassir should be
addressed in order to avoid further violence.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">It is recommended that the SSPDF
takes urgent steps to improve training, discipline, and accountability.

24.Armed civilians referred to as the ‘White Army’ pose a significant threat to
security in the area.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">This threat needs to be addressed by all parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">It is
recommended that the SPLM/A-IO takes all possible steps to control these
elements in the areas under their control.

</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">25.The SSPDF should ensure that all the issues concerning the killing of the two
civilians are addressed in the proper way.</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">Justice must be seen to be done.

26.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">Stakeholders in Nassir are working together to ensure security, but the
successful measures undertaken, such as the establishment of weapon control

    
check points, have been undermined by poor discipline.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">The cooperative
approach to providing security should be improved and sustained.
