Executive Summary 

This Report of the Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (RJMEC) 
on  the  status  of  implementation  of  the  Revitalized  Agreement  on  the  Resolution  of  the 
Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) covers the period from 1st July to 30th 
September 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">It highlights the prevailing political, security, humanitarian, and economic 
situation in the country and outlines the progress or lack thereof being made by the Parties 
and the Agreement institutions and mechanisms as they seek to implement their mandate 
during the extended Pre-Transitional Period ending on 12th November.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">In addition, it details 
the engagement of the RJMEC leadership with the Parties, stakeholders and adherents, and 
guarantors of the R-ARCSS, the international community, and other actors.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">Finally, it makes 
some key observations and offers recommendations for remedial action to ensure effective 
implementation of the Agreement. 

The highlight of political developments during the quarter was the meeting in Juba between 
President Salva Kiir and Dr. Riek Machar the Chairman of the Sudan People’s Liberation 
Movement/Army - In Opposition (SPLM/A-IO).</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">At the same time, the security situation in 
the Republic of South Sudan continues to be stable as the Permanent Ceasefire continue to 
hold.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">Isolated incidents of clashes were attributed to troops loyal to a non-signatory to the 
Agreement General Thomas Cirillo and government and SPLM/A-IO forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">Importantly, 
during the three-month reporting period, there were no new reports of Sexual and Gender 
Based Violence (SGBV).  

</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">Aid agencies were able to successfully provide humanitarian assistance without hindrances. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">The number of displaced persons in camps within South Sudan and those in neighbouring 
countries  of  Sudan,  Kenya,  Ethiopia,  Uganda  and  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo 
reduced to 3.8 million.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The decline comes as more than half a million refugees and IDPs are 
estimated to have returned to their homes since the signing of the RARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">The increasing 
pace of voluntary returns is attributable to the generally improved security situation.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">During  the  reporting  period,  the  Disarmament  Demobilization  and  Reintegration  (DDR) 
Commission  was  finally  reconstituted.  </a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">Also,  twenty-three  out  of  twenty-five  cantonment 
sites of the Opposition were opened along with three barracks occupied by the SSPDF and 
had  begun  registration.  </a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">However,  other  key  tasks  remained  uncompleted  including 
determining the number of states of South Sudan, their boundaries, and the restructuring of 
the Council of States, training and deployment of the Necessary Unified Forces, others being 
the enactment of the Constitutional Amendment Bill and the other laws previously reviewed 
by  the  NCAC.  </a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">These  are  all  considered  very  critical  to  laying  the  foundation  for  the 
formation of the RTGoNU on 12th November 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">Overall, of the 63 activities expected to 
be  carried  out  during  the  Pre-Transitional  Period,  31  had  been  completed  while  22  were 
considered ongoing and 10 yet to commence.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">

In view of the unfinished Pre-Transitional tasks, the Parties at the invitation of the IGAD 
Council of Ministers held a meeting in Addis in an attempt at resolving these issues.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The 
Council urged the Parties to continue to dialogue and consult on the number and boundaries 
of  states  with  a  view  to  finding  a  common  solution,  and  to  report  the  same  to  the  next 
Ordinary Summit of the IGAD Heads of  State and  Government.  </a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">It  also  resolved that the 
IGAD  Heads  of  State  and  government  should  convene  face-to-face  meetings  of  the  top 
leadership of the Parties to discuss and resolve outstanding issues, prevail on President Salva 
Kiir  to  disburse  the  outstanding  balance  of  the  US  $100  million  committed  by  the 

 

  
 ii 

government, and canton and barrack at least 50 percent of the Necessary Unified Forces by 
end-September 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">However, the Parties failed to meet to September 30th deadline and 
are yet to discuss the issue of the states.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">No further resources were reportedly made available 
to the security mechanisms from the US $100 million.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">

Concerning  the  security  mechanisms,  during  the  period  under  review,  the  Joint  Military 
Ceasefire Commission (JMCC) verified the 25 cantonment sites for the opposition forces 
and  the  10  barracks  for  the  SSPDF  and  started  registration.  </a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">At  the  same  time,  the  Joint 
Transitional  Security  Committee  (JTSC)  assessed  18  centres  for  the  training  of  the 
Necessary Unified Forces and finalised the syllabus to be used for the training component. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">For  its  part,  the  Strategic  Defence  and  Security  Review  Board  (SDSRB)  successfully 
completed  engagement  with  refugees  in  the  neighbouring  countries  and  held  a  focused 
group discussion with the senior leadership of the various security sector institutions.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The 
meetings were aimed at soliciting their views on the security sector challenges and a possible 
way forward.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">Finally, in July the Ceasefire Transitional Security Arrangement Monitoring and 
Verification Mechanism (CTSAMVM) witnessed the release of 32 child soldiers aged between 
13 and 17 who had served with the SPLM/A-IO from 2016.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">CTSAMVM also assisted the 
JMCC in verifying the various cantonment sites.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">During the period under review, the RJMEC continued to effectively engage the parties and 
stakeholders on the slow pace of implementation of the Pre-transitional tasks  and urging 
them  to  expedite  and  complete  all  the  pending  tasks.  </a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">The  RJMEC  leadership  held  three 
rounds of monthly consultations with the Parties to the Agreement, the Stakeholders and the 
Regional guarantors and diplomatic community.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">RJMEC also continued its contribution to 
the  wide  dissemination  of  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">A  variety  of  communications  products  were 
released  during  the  latest  reporting  period,  namely:</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42"> printed  summaries  of  the  Peace 
Agreement in Dinka, Nuer, Bari, Zande and Collo (Shilluk).</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">Using the logistics of UNMISS 
and CTSAMVM, tens of thousands of copies of the summaries of the Peace Agreements 
have been transported to different parts of South Sudan.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">With  very  little  time  remaining  to  the  expected  formation  of  the  RTGoNU  by  12th 
November,  the  slow  pace  of  screening  and  training  the  Necessary  Unified  Forces  is  of 
uttermost concern.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">Another setback has been the inability of the Parties to resolve the issue 
of the number of States and boundaries.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">Without the resolution of all the outstanding issues, 
and completion of the critical pending tasks, the formation of the RTGoNU will be difficult, 
and may negatively affect the implementation of the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">The full implementation 
of  the  Pre-Transitional  tasks  was  intended  to  lay  a  firm  foundation  for  the  effective 
implementation of the Agreement and for the Parties to demonstrate their commitment to 
implement  the Agreement  in  letter and spirit.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">The tasks were  also  informed by the bitter 
experiences of forming a government without the legal and security foundation during the 
2015 peace Agreement and the desire to avoid a repeat of the violence that erupted in July 
2016.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">

The work of the DDR Commission will be critical to the success of the overall cantonment 
process since it can offer meaningful alternatives to the former combatants.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">In order to move 
forward with the nearly stalled cantonment process, additional resources must be availed to 
the  security  mechanisms  including  the  provision  of  adequate  food,  water  and  medical 
supplies  for  the  cantonment  sites.  </a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Ultimately  the  Parties  to  the  Agreement  will  need  to 
collectively  decide  on  the  best  course  of  action  in  order  to  consolidate  the  gains  already 
made and to set the country on an irreversible path to sustainable peace.

I. Introduction 

1.  </a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">This Report is prepared pursuant to Chapter VII, Article 7.9 of the Revitalised Agreement 
on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) and covers 
the period 1st July to 30th September 2019.  </a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">During the third quarter of 2019, the Parties to 
the Agreement met in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and agreed to focus on resolving the issue of 
the number of states and their boundaries;</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">and to speed up the cantonment and training of 
the  Necessary  Unified  Forces.  </a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">These  two  crucial  activities  were  viewed  as  essential  in 
paving the way for the successful formation of the Revitalised Transitional Government of 
National Unity (RTGoNU). 

2.  </a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">Notwithstanding the commitment of the Parties to resolve the issue of the number of states 
of South Sudan, their boundaries, and the restructuring of the Council of States;</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">the third 
quarter ended without any resolution.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">In addition, the critical tasks of the screening, training 
and  redeployment  of  Necessary  Unified  Forces  (NUFs)  has  not  started.  </a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">Although 
constrained by a continued lack of resources, the security mechanisms were able to begin 
the registration within the cantonments, which offered hope for the screening and eventual 
training and redeployment of the Necessary Unified Forces (NUFs);</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">a key requirement in 
the lead up to the formation of the RTGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">In addition, the Disarmament Demobilization 
and Reintegration (DDR) Commission was finally reconstituted.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">The above tasks formed 
part  of  the  sixty-three  (63)  activities  outlined  in  the  R-ARCSS,  which  were  to  be 
implemented during the Pre-Transitional Period, and in the lead up to the formation of the 
RTGoNU on 12th November 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Of the 63 activities, 31 are considered completed, 22 are 
ongoing and 10 are still pending. 

3.  </a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">During the reporting period, the general political and security situation remained relatively 
stable  and  the  Permanent  Ceasefire  continued  to  hold  throughout  South  Sudan.  </a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">This  is  a 
situation  that  has  been  maintained  since  the  signing  of  the  R-ARCSS  on  12th  September 
2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">However, in a few areas of the country namely the Yei River area there were reported 
clashes  between  a  non-signatory  group  allied  to  General  Thomas  Cirillo  of  the  National 
Salvation Front (NAS) and those of the South Sudan Peoples’ Defence Forces (SSPDF) and 
the Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army - In Opposition (SPLA-IO).</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">Incidents of cattle rustling, 
which occurred consistently during the previous quarter have noticeably subsided.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">   

4.  </a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">The improved security situation in  the country has contributed to  the voluntary  return  of 
over 530,000 of the estimated 4.1 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and refugees 
to their homes, since the signing of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">At the same time, there has been a general 
improvement  in  the  humanitarian  situation  including  unhindered  access  by  various  aid 
agencies.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">At the same time, the continuing improvement in the security situation and the 
respecting of the  Permanent  Ceasefire has resulted in  increased  food production in  some 
regions of the country impacted by the returnees.

<p><a id="72" name="72">Section  II  of  the  Report  which  follows  highlights  the  prevailing  political,  security, 
humanitarian and economic situation in the Republic of South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">Section III focuses on 
the status of implementation of the Pre-Transitional tasks while Section IV offers updates 
on the activities of the Agreement institutions and implementation mechanisms, and Section 
V highlights RJMEC’s engagements in enhancing its mandate of monitoring and evaluation.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74"> 
Finally, Section VI presents observations and recommendations, all of which are augmented 
by a detailed list and update of the activities pursued since the signing of the R-ARCSS, in

6.  </a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">The long-anticipated visit of the leader of the SPLM/A-IO Dr Riek Machar to Juba to meet 
with  President Salva Kiir highlighted political  developments  during the  reporting period. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">The  two  leaders  met  on  the  invitation  of  the  President  on  9th  and  11th  September  and 
discussed ways in which to advance implementation of the Pre-Transitional activities.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">The 
discussions  were  generally  held  in  a  cordial  atmosphere  and  signalled  a  positive 
development in the relationship between the two leaders as well as between the two largest 
Parties within the Agreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">Although there were no major breakthroughs, particularly on 
the issue of the determination of the number of states, the visit was generally well received 
by the public and provided an added impetus to the implementation of the Peace Agreement.  

7.  </a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">The  Security  Situation  in  the  country  is  highlighted  by  the  continued  sustaining  of  the 
Permanent Ceasefire.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">The trend observed in previous periods with all the Parties respecting 
the  signed  agreement  continued  throughout  this  quarter.  </a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">Notwithstanding  this  positive 
development there were sporadic clashes, mainly in July and confined to the Yei River area, 
between forces loyal to General Thomas Cirillo of the National Salvation Front (NAS) and 
those  of  the  South  Sudanese  Peoples’  Defence  Forces  (SSPDF)  and  the  Sudan  Peoples' 
Liberation  Army  -  In  Opposition  (SPLA-IO).  </a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">The  clashes  contributed  to  some  civilian 
displacements.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">More importantly, the continuing stability has been attributed as the main 
reason  for  the  increasing  numbers  of  voluntary  returns  of  the  IDPs  and  refugees  to  their 
homes.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">

8.  </a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">With regards to the Humanitarian Situation data from the Integrated Food Security Phase 
Classification  (IPC)1  released  during  September  and  reported  by  the  UN  Office  for  the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) 2 estimates that 6.35 million people in South 
Sudan “do not know where their next meal will come from.”</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">This represents more than half 
of  the  population  who  are  considered  seriously  food  insecure,  which  is  a  modest

Commission, OXFAM, Save the Children, SICA, UNICEF, and WFP.</a></p>

improvement over the previous quarter3.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">Residents of the Greater Upper Nile region are the 
most  food  insecure,  followed  by  the  Greater  Bahr  el  Ghazal  region,  while  those  in 
catastrophe are in Yirol East of the former Lakes state.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">The humanitarian agencies estimate 
that they will require urgent attention in order to remedy the situation.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">The OCHA report 
also points to the fact that the situation is slowly improving on account of the peace that has 
returned to the country since the signing of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">This has enabled the voluntary 
return of farmers, increased supplies of food in the market and improved livelihoods.</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">

9.  </a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">With respect to the number of displaced persons, data from (OCHA) showed that there were 
approximately four million people or roughly the same level with that cited at the end of the 
second quarter of 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">However, new research showed that the number of IDPs dropped 
to 1.5 million from the estimated 1.9 million at the end of June 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">At the same time, there 
was  an  estimated  2.33  million  refugees  living  in  the  neighbouring  countries  of  Kenya, 
Uganda, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">Chapter  III  of  the  R-ARCSS  in  Article  3.1.1.2  reiterates  “The  right  of  Refugees  and 
Internally Displaced Persons to return in safety and dignity and to be afforded physical, 
legal and psychological protection.”  The return of the IDP’s has been largely voluntary 
with UNMISS assisting in some instances with transportation.</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">However, the United Nations 
High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has indicated that the current conditions, while 
improving, were not yet conducive for large scale, durable, safe and dignified returns of the 
IDPs.</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">Concerning  the  Economy,  the  continuing  improvement  in  the  security  situation  and  the 
respecting of the  Permanent  Ceasefire has resulted in  increased  food production in  some 
regions of the country as farmers return to their land.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">While this is still on a relatively small 
scale a continuation of this trend can ultimately have some impact on reducing food prices. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">During the period under review, world oil prices remained relatively stable, although at a 
lower level to the previous quarter, and oil production increased to an average of 170 000 
barrels/day.  </a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">This would have positively impacted the government’s oil revenues.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">However, 
the country continues to feel the impact of earlier disruptions in the economy.</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">For the most 
part, the government still accrue public service payment arrears, inflation remains elevated, 
and the exchange rate continues to come under pressure.

<p><a id="109" name="109">Status of Implementation of the R-ARCSS Pre-Transitional Activities 

12.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">The end of the quarter under review marked a remaining period of just six weeks to the end 
of  the  extended  six  months  Pre-Transitional  Period.  </a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">Of  the  63  activities  expected  to  be 
carried  out  during  the  Pre-Transitional  Period,  31  had  been  completed  while  22  were 
considered  ongoing  and  10  yet  to  commence.  </a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">A  detailed  analysis  of  all  the  activities  is 
provided in  Annex A of this Report.</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">Of the pending tasks, RJMEC assesses that the key 
ones,  which  if  not  implemented,  could  adversely  impact  the  formation  of  the  RTGoNU

meeting of the Parties on 21st August under the Chairmanship of H.E Gedu Andargachew 
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Ethiopia and its Chairperson.5 The meeting 
focused  on  addressing  the  issue  of  the  determination  of  the  number  of  states  and  other 
pertinent  issues  related  to  the  status  of  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS,  with  a  view  to 
resolving this issue.</a></p>
<p><a id="127" name="127">Consequently, at the Addis meeting, the IGAD Council of Ministers6 
urged  the  Parties  to  continue  dialoguing  and  consulting  on  the  issue  of  the  number  and 
boundaries of states with a view to finding a common solution and to report the same to the 
next Ordinary Summit of the IGAD Heads of Government.

<p><a id="136" name="136">The  meetings 
provided an opportunity for the two leaders to discuss the outstanding issues related to the 
implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="137" name="137">Although no formal statement was issued following their 
discussions,  it  was  generally  agreed  that  the  meeting  was  cordial  and  provided  a  much-
needed boost to the peace process.</a></p>
<p><a id="138" name="138">However, the Parties failed to meet to discuss the issue 
of the states, notwithstanding that at the face-to-face meeting the two leaders agreed to set 
up a committee to urgently address the outstanding issue.</a></p>

<p><a id="142" name="142">During that time twenty-three out of 
twenty-five of the Opposition sites were opened along with three barracks occupied by the SSPDF,

provided  tents,  medical  supplies  and  uniforms,  while  the  AU  provided  tents  and  other  supplies. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="144" name="144">However, the process was hampered by insufficient funding, and lack of water, food and medicines 
at  the  sites.  </a></p>

VI.   </a></p>
<p><a id="237" name="237">Observations and Recommendations  

28.</a></p>
<p><a id="238" name="238">With very little time remaining to the intended date for the formation of the RTGoNU, the 
slow pace of screening and training of the NUF is of serious concern.</a></p>
<p><a id="239" name="239">Another setback has 
been the inability of the Parties to discuss and resolve, as previously agreed, the issue of the 
number of States and their boundaries, and on the composition of the Council of States.</a></p>
<p><a id="240" name="240">It’s 
important to note that the full implementation of the Pre-Transitional tasks was intended to 
lay a firm foundation for the effective implementation of the Agreement and for the Parties 
to demonstrate their commitment to implement the Agreement in letter and spirit.</a></p>
<p><a id="241" name="241">The tasks 
were also informed by the bitter experiences of forming a government without the requisite 
legal and security foundation during the 2015 peace Agreement and the desire to avoid a 
repeat of the kind of violence that erupted in July 2016.</a></p>
<p><a id="242" name="242">

29.</a></p>
<p><a id="243" name="243">While  some  progress  was  made  on  vacating  civilian  centres,  the  fact  that  37  are  still 
occupied  is  a  cause  of  concern.  </a></p>
<p><a id="244" name="244">Reasonable  progress  has  been  made  with  respect  to  the 
decline in reported incidents of SGBV, with no new reports attributed to the armed forces. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="245" name="245">The  Parties  have  exerted  efforts  to  combat  SGBV  and  in  some  cases  arrests  of  the 
perpetrators have been made.</a></p>
<p><a id="246" name="246">Also of note is the marked decline of impediment access to 
the humanitarian actors.</a></p>
<p><a id="247" name="247">In fact, no such incidents were reported during the quarter and they 
have  been  able  to  operate  throughout  the  country  with  the  delivery  of  humanitarian 
assistance.</a></p>
<p><a id="248" name="248">Ultimately, the improved security environment has led to increased confidence 
among  the  civilian  population,  which  has  translated  into  greater  numbers  of  voluntary 
returns to their homes, particularly from among the IDPs. 

 

 

  
 </a></p>
<p><a id="249" name="249">10 

30.</a></p>
<p><a id="250" name="250">The  reconstitution  of  the  DDR  Commission  completed  the  setting  up  of  all  the  security 
mechanisms  under  the  R-ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="251" name="251">Its  work  will  be  critical  to  the  success  of  the  overall 
cantonment  process  since  it  can  offer  meaningful  alternatives  to  the  former  combatants. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="252" name="252">Although  its  establishment  was  long  overdue,  it  still  has  the  opportunity  to  favourably 
impact  the  cantonment  process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="253" name="253">The  release  of  child  soldiers  by  the  SPLA-IO  was  also 
welcome news, as the former warring Parties attempt to distance themselves from the past 
conflict and set their sights on a lasting peace.  

31.</a></p>
<p><a id="254" name="254">In order to move forward with the nearly stalled cantonment process, additional resources 
must  be  availed  to  the  security  mechanisms.  </a></p>
<p><a id="255" name="255">In  the  past,  where  the  mechanisms  have 
received funding they demonstrated their ability to utilise it in moving the process forward. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="256" name="256">This  was  true  for  the  first  phase  of  the  cantonment  process  where  the  mechanisms  after 
receiving US $6.5 million were able to initiate the process.</a></p>
<p><a id="257" name="257">By the same token without the 
requisite resources to forge ahead with the screening and training of the NUFs the entire 
process could unravel.</a></p>
<p><a id="258" name="258">This will necessarily involve the provision of adequate food, water 
and medical supplies for the cantonment sites.   

32.</a></p>
<p><a id="259" name="259">When IGAD reverted to the Parties to find a solution in resolving the issue of the number 
of states and their boundaries, as well as the determination of the Council of States, it was 
because  it  was  felt  that  going  the  way  of  a  referendum  would  be  too  costly  and  a  near 
impossible  undertaking  at  this  time.  </a></p>
<p><a id="260" name="260">Failure  to  agree  on  the  number  of  states  could  also 
adversely impact on the formation of the RTGoNU in view of Article 1.16.2 which provides 
that  “At  the  beginning  of  the  Transitional  Period  state  and  local  government  shall  be 
reconstituted”.</a></p>
<p><a id="261" name="261">This provision will be difficult to implement if there is no agreement on the 
number of states.</a></p>
<p><a id="262" name="262">Consequently, the leaderships of the Parties are urged to vigorously pursue 
a political solution during the remainder of the Pre-Transitional Period.  

33.</a></p>
<p><a id="263" name="263">RJMEC  reiterates  its  recommendation  that  political  leaders  need  to  adopt  a  unified  and 
coordinated awareness campaign with respect to the promotion and dissemination of the R-
ARCSS throughout the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="264" name="264">This will undoubtedly send a very strong message to the 
people of South Sudan that the Parties are indeed united in their joint pursuit of lasting peace 
in the country.</a></p>
<p><a id="265" name="265">In addition, there needs to be continued dialogue among the Parties in order 
to build on the twelve months of solid progress that has been witnessed. 

                                                   VII.</a></p>
<p><a id="266" name="266">Conclusion 

34.</a></p>
<p><a id="267" name="267">The critical issues of a determination on the number of states and requirement to train and 
redeploy the NUFs continue to  be major concerns as the 12th November deadline for the 
formation of the R-TGoNU approaches.  </a></p>
<p><a id="268" name="268">Given the time remaining, it is  unlikely that the 
stated  number  of  83,000  NUFs  will  be  trained  and  redeployed.  </a></p>
<p><a id="269" name="269">This  calls  for  continued 
political will and the availing of resources to address the two critical issues.</a></p>
<p><a id="270" name="270">It also calls for 
the Agreement Parties to meet at the highest political level in order to carefully discuss the 
best  course  of  action  going  forward.  </a></p>
<p><a id="271" name="271">Whatever  options  are  agreed  to  by  the  Parties,  the 
RJMEC insists that there must be a firm foundation upon which the RTGoNU be formed 

 

  
 11 

and that mistakes made in the past, especially the existence of parallel forces under different 
commands, should never be repeated. 

35.</a></p>
<p><a id="272" name="272">After a year of implementing the R-ARCSS, the Parties have shown a willingness to give 
peace a chance in South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="273" name="273">They have worked admirably together in all the security 
implementation  mechanisms,  which  has  offered  real  hope  to  the  citizens.  </a></p>
<p><a id="274" name="274">This  is  clearly 
evidenced by the maintaining of the Permanent Ceasefire and the increasing willingness of 
the IDPs to return to their homes.</a></p>
<p><a id="275" name="275">Notwithstanding a lack of adequate resources, the Parties 
have  worked  hard  to  make  progress  in  several  key  areas  with  the  completion  of  31  Pre-
Transitional activities.</a></p>
<p><a id="276" name="276">In addition, the work of the NCAC in revising old laws and drafting 
new ones has been commendable.  </a></p>
<p><a id="277" name="277">No doubt, these gains should be consolidated, and all 
efforts should encourage the Parties to complete all critical pending tasks and to lay a firm 
foundation in the pursuit of lasting peace, which can hopefully be irreversible. 

36.</a></p>
<p><a id="278" name="278">RJMEC on its part shall continue to impartially monitor, evaluate and report as it vigorously 
carries  out  its  oversight  responsibilities  with  regards  to  the  R-ARCSS,  and  make 
interventions when necessary.</a></p>
<p><a id="279" name="279">It will also continue providing regular reports and briefings 
to the incumbent TGoNU, the TNLA, the Chairperson of the IGAD Council of Ministers, 
the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, the Peace and Security Council of the 
AU, and to the Secretary-General and the United Nations Security Council.</a></p>

From the Implementation Matrix as provided by the R-ARCSS, a series of important tasks 
were required to be implemented during the Pre-Transitional Period which has since been 
extended from 8 to 14 months.  </a></p>
<p><a id="521" name="521">The above table summarises RJMEC’s assessment of sixty-
three  (63)  key  Pre-Transitional  activities  which  are  required  to  be  implemented.  </a></p>
<p><a id="522" name="522">For  the 
purpose of RJMECs assessment, the Pre-Transitional tasks were categorised into three broad 
categories and assessed to determine their current status of implementation i.e. complete, 
pending or ongoing.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="523" name="523">  Complete  tasks  refer  to  the  tasks  accomplished  as  per  the  Agreement  or  continuing 

obligations which have been complied with to date;</a></p>
<p><a id="524" name="524"> 

  Pending tasks refer to tasks which remain outstanding or where no significant action has 

been taken towards its implementation;</a></p>
<p><a id="525" name="525">and  

 

  
 21 

  Ongoing tasks refer to tasks where there have been some significant progress/steps taken 
towards  its  implementation,  but  which  either  remains  incomplete  or  partially 
implemented.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="526" name="526">Results:</a></p>
<p><a id="527" name="527">From the above table:</a></p>
<p><a id="528" name="528">

  31  out  of  63  tasks  have been  completed  with  various  degree  of  success  or  continuing 

obligations which have been complied with to date;</a></p>
<p><a id="529" name="529"> 

  10  tasks  are  still  pending.  </a></p>
<p><a id="530" name="530">These  are  tasks  which  are  yet  to  be  implemented  and  no 

significant steps have as yet been taken in this regard;</a></p>
<p><a id="531" name="531">and   

  22 tasks are ongoing.</a></p>
<p><a id="532" name="532">These are tasks where some positive steps have been taken towards 

implementation but still far from completion or achieving required targets.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="533" name="533">Observations:</a></p>
<p><a id="534" name="534">

The  tasks  highlighted  above  vary  in  their  importance  in  determining  real  progress  in  the 
peace process and their implementation or lack thereof have different implications when it 
comes  to  the  formation  of  the  RTGoNU,  and  for  the  effective  implementation  of  the 
Agreement during the Transitional Period.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="535" name="535">Majority of the Pre-Transitional tasks were under Chapter 1 (Governance) and Chapter 2 
(Security Arrangements).</a></p>
<p><a id="536" name="536">There were some tasks under Chapter 3 on humanitarian affairs, 
a  few  tasks  under  Chapter  7  relating  to  RJMEC  and  one  task  under  Chapter  8  on  the 
ratification of the Agreement by the Parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="537" name="537">

Of  all  the  Pre-Transitional  tasks,  the  most  consequential  ones  are  the  tasks  relating  to 
governance  and  security  arrangements  which  are  core  to  the  Agreement  implementation, 
and some are prerequisite to the formation of the RTGoNU.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="538" name="538">Within the Governance Chapter, the key Pre-Transitional tasks were as follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="539" name="539">

  the need for wide dissemination of the Agreement;</a></p>
<p><a id="540" name="540">  

  establishment  of  new  institutions  and  mechanisms  created  by  the  Agreement  and 

reconstitution of old ones;</a></p>
<p><a id="541" name="541">

  resolution of the issues of number and boundaries of states/composition and restructuring 

of the council of states;</a></p>
<p><a id="542" name="542"> 

  incorporation of the Agreement into the TCRSS;</a></p>
<p><a id="543" name="543"> 

  review and amendment of relevant laws;</a></p>
<p><a id="544" name="544"> 

  agreement on the allocation of ministerial portfolios;</a></p>
<p><a id="545" name="545">and  

  nomination of parties’ representatives to the TNLA.  

 

  
 22 

Out of the above key governance tasks, only tasks associated with the establishment of new 
agreement  institutions  and  reconstitution  of  existing  ones  have  been  completed.  </a></p>
<p><a id="546" name="546">The 
dissemination of the Agreement is ongoing and can continue into the Transitional Period.</a></p>
<p><a id="547" name="547">

However, consequential tasks such the resolution of the issue of number and boundaries of 
states  and  the  council  of  states,  incorporation  of  Agreement  into  TCRSS,  amendment  of 
relevant laws, allocation of ministerial portfolios and nomination of representatives to the 
TNLA  still  remains  outstanding.  </a></p>
<p><a id="548" name="548">These  tasks  are  very  critical  for  the  timely  and  smooth 
formation of the RTGoNU. 

Within the Security Chapter, the key pre-transitional tasks were as follows:</a></p>
<p><a id="549" name="549">

  observation of the Permanent Ceasefire throughout the country;</a></p>
<p><a id="550" name="550">

  dissemination of provisions of the Permanent Ceasefire to all allied forces;</a></p>
<p><a id="551" name="551">

 establishment or reconstitution of relevant security mechanisms like JDB, JMCC, JTSC, 

SDSR, and CTSAMVM;</a></p>
<p><a id="552" name="552">

  disengagement of forces/withdrawals from theatre of operations;</a></p>
<p><a id="553" name="553">

  release of prisoners of wars and political detainees;</a></p>
<p><a id="554" name="554">

  withdrawal of authorised foreign forces;</a></p>
<p><a id="555" name="555">

  stopping the recruitment of child soldiers;</a></p>
<p><a id="556" name="556">

  Opening of humanitarian corridors and access;</a></p>
<p><a id="557" name="557">

  refraining from acts of sexual and gender-based violence;</a></p>
<p><a id="558" name="558">

  refraining from use of child soldiers;</a></p>
<p><a id="559" name="559">

  refraining from offensive/provocative actions;</a></p>
<p><a id="560" name="560">

  ceasing all hostilities and adhering to the CoHA 

  demilitarisation of civilian centres;</a></p>
<p><a id="561" name="561">

  guaranteeing free movement of civilians and goods;</a></p>
<p><a id="562" name="562">

  cantonment of forces;</a></p>
<p><a id="563" name="563">

  training and deployment of necessary unified forces;</a></p>
<p><a id="564" name="564">

  reconstitution of the DDR Commission;</a></p>
<p><a id="565" name="565">and 

  completion of SDSR work on framework for security sector reforms.</a></p>
<p><a id="566" name="566">

Some of the above tasks are ongoing obligations which span into the Transitional Period 
while  others  are  also  pre-requisites  for  the  formation  of  the  RTGoNU.  </a></p>
<p><a id="567" name="567">In  the  former 
category, the key ongoing obligations which have been implemented and continues include;</a></p>
<p><a id="568" name="568">

 

  
 23 

the observance of the Permanent Ceasefire by the parties, dissemination of its provisions to 
allied forces;</a></p>
<p><a id="569" name="569">disengagement of forces, refraining from acts of SGBV/use of child soldiers 
or provocative actions, unification of all forces and security sector reforms.</a></p>
<p><a id="570" name="570">In this regard, 
the  ongoing  observance  by  parties  of  the  Permanent  Ceasefire  is  a  very  significant 
achievement and must be consolidated upon.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="571" name="571">In the latter category, the critical security arrangements necessary for the smooth formation 
of the RTGoNU and effectively implementation of the Agreement includes the cantonment 
of  all  forces,  training,  and  deployment  of  necessary  unified  forces,  release  of 
prisoners/detainees, demilitarisation of civilian centres, reconstitution of DDR Commission, 
opening humanitarian corridors and guaranteeing free movement of civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="572" name="572">In this regard, 
some progress has been made in cantonment of forces, demilitarisation of civilian centres, 
release  of  prisoners/detainees,  refraining  from  recruitment/use  of  child  soldiers  and 
reconstitution of DDR Commission.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="573" name="573">However,  the  major  outstanding  critical  security  arrangements  tasks  include;</a></p>
<p><a id="574" name="574"> completing 
cantonment  of  all  forces,  training  and  deployment  of  necessary  unified  forces  and 
demilitarisation of civilian centres.</a></p>
<p><a id="575" name="575">These are pre-requisite to the formation of the RTGoNU. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="576" name="576">An effective transitional security arrangement is the bedrock upon which implementation of 
the Agreement will succeed.</a></p>
<p><a id="577" name="577">This is important to avoid past mistakes and the Parties at the 
HLRF were mindful of past mistakes and insisted that the RTGoNU should not be formed 
until the deployment of the necessary unified forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="578" name="578">

Challenges  

The major constraints to the implementation of the Agreement by the parties, so far appear 
to be an acute lack of funding/resources.</a></p>
<p><a id="579" name="579">The recent progress made in the cantonment of 
forces was made possible with the funding and in-kind support provided by some partners. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="580" name="580">The government should explain why it has not been able to provide all the pledged funds 
and when its disbursement will be completed.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="581" name="581">Other  challenges  include  trust  deficits,  lack  of  effective  leadership,  lack  of  proper 
coordination and capacity gaps, and fall outs within some of the Parties to the Agreement 
like SSOA, which accounts for the delays in the implementation of critical pending tasks. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="582" name="582">The Parties should be tasked to demonstrate their full commitment to the implementation of 
the  Agreement  and  show  cause  why  delays  and  timelines  continue  to  be  missed  with 
concrete proposals on how to address them.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="583" name="583">There are also some challenges which are contextual and outside the Agreement but directly 
impact  its  implementation.  </a></p>
<p><a id="584" name="584">These  include  the  activities  of  the  holdout  groups/non-
signatories  and  the  delayed  determination  of  the  final  status  of  the  Dr.  Riek  Machar  by 
IGAD summit.   </a></p>
<p><a id="585" name="585">IGAD should take steps to urgently address the above issues and ensure 
uninterrupted implementation of the Agreement.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="586" name="586">The above challenges, if not urgently and comprehensively addressed, risk delaying further 
the formation of the RTGoNU or even reversing some of the progress that has already been 
made.

Conclusion  

In conclusion, therefore, significant progress has been made in the implementation of the R-
ARCSS over the last thirteen months and every effort must be made to consolidate them. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="588" name="588">The  overall  security  situation  and  humanitarian  access  have  improved  greatly  across  the 
country because of the Permanent Ceasefire.</a></p>
<p><a id="589" name="589">The South Sudanese citizens are very grateful 
for this progress and they are showing a growing sign of confidence in the peace process. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="590" name="590">Last week, the UNMISS reported that over 600,000 IDPs had left PoCs and returned home 
voluntarily.</a></p>
<p><a id="591" name="591">This is commendable indeed.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="592" name="592">However,  even  though  numerically,  the  number  of  pending  tasks  is  fewer  than  the 
completed or ongoing tasks, they are very critical and consequential for the formation of the 
RTGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="593" name="593">The pending security and governance tasks especially were contentious from the 
beginning, including at the negotiations.</a></p>
<p><a id="594" name="594">Their full implementation or politically acceptable 
alternative arrangements amongst the Parties is therefore critical in demonstrating political 
will of the Parties and their commitment to the full implementation of the Agreement.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="595" name="595">In RJMEC’s opinion, the following pending tasks are critical and should be completed to 
aid  the  smooth  formation  of  the  RTGoNU  and  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the 
Transitional Period, namely:</a></p>
<p><a id="596" name="596"> 

 enactment  of the amended Constitution incorporating provisions of the  R-ARCSS and 

relevant laws to give a firm legal basis for the formation of the RTGoNU;</a></p>
<p><a id="597" name="597">

 cantonment of all forces;</a></p>
<p><a id="598" name="598">

 training and deployment of the agreed minimum number of the NUFs;</a></p>
<p><a id="599" name="599">

 agreement on the number of states and boundaries and the composition and structure of 

the council of states for the transitional period;</a></p>
<p><a id="600" name="600">

  agreement on the allocation of the various ministerial portfolios;</a></p>
<p><a id="601" name="601">and 

  submission by Parties of a list of the TNLA nominees to the NCAC.
