Commander of the " Division and a former commander of the South Sudan Liberation
Army (SSLA) currently being integrated into Government Forces in Unity State).
</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">Further investigations indicate that although the underage soldiers are assigned
operational military duties, they are not fully integrated into Government Forces and
therefore are not on the payroll.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">Instead, they only receive food as repayment for
services.

recruiting and assigning child soldiers to military duties in Bentiu and Mayom.
</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">5.0  Conclusion

JTC that Government Forces are violating the following articles of the Cessation of Hostilities
Agreement (23 January 2014), in Bentiu and Mayom (Unity State):
- 3.0  The parties shall cease all acts of violence including summary executions,
displacement of populations, all forms of torture, destruction of property, attacking
civilian aircrafts, vehicles or riverboats, recruitment of child soldiers or any other
acts as prohibited by applicable national, continental and international instruments.
</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">5.0      It is therefore recommended that the IGAD Special Envoys take the appropriate action
against GRSS in response to the violations of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement and
encourage Government Forces to immediately cease the recruitment of child soldiers, and
demobilize all underage soldiers in their units.
