EXECTIVE SUMMARY
On 16 January 2022 the “SPLM-IG” (as it is described in the agreements) signed two
agreements:</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">one was an agreement on Status of Forces with the whole SPLM/A-IO
Kit-Gwang movement, and the other was a specific agreement to integrate the
Agwelek forces into the SSPDF.
</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">Following disagreements between SPLM/A-IO Kit-Gwang forces loyal to General
Simon Gatwech and Agwelek forces loyal to General Johnson Olony, fighting between
the two factions broke out and the SPLM/A-IO Kit-Gwang was pushed out of Tonga.
</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">The conflict spread, and local armed groups referred to as the “White Army” became
involved.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">The status of the SPLM/A-IO Kit Gwang and Agwelek forces was never
clarified by the ITGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">On 15 August Agwelek forces in Tonga were attacked:</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">
witnesses gave confused accounts of who the attackers were but all said the “White
Army” was involved.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">The attack was repulsed.
</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">On or about 18-19 August 2022 Agwelek forces in  or  barges passed through
Malakal and attacked SPLM/A-IO positions in Diel and New Fangak.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">The Commander
of SSPDF  Division in Malakal confirmed that he had been ordered to facilitate the
movement of the Agwelek forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">Following these attacks and in reprisal the “White
Army” together with some SPLM/A-IO advanced towards and attacked Tonga.
</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">It is the assessment of CTSAMVM that there is a clear relationship between the
SSPDF and Agwelek forces, and that in facilitating the movement of these forces
before they attacked SPLM/A-IO positions, the SSPDF acted in clear violation of the
R-ARCSS.

VIOLENCE IN UPPER NILE STATE AND NORTHERN JONGLEI STATE
FROM JULY 2022
|             Introduction
1. Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">

a. On 16 January 2022 an agreement on Status of Forces was signed in
Khartoum between the “SPLM-IG’ (as it is described in the agreement) and the
SPLM/A-IO Kit-Gwang.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">Both Generals Simon Gatwech and Johnson Olony
signed on behalf of the Kit-Gwang.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">On the same day a separate agreement
was signed between the “SPLM-IG” and the Agwelek Forces, which specifically
states that the “Agwelek forces will promptly integrate into the SSPDF”.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">On 17
January 2022 the Commander in Chief of the SPLM/A-IO, First Vice President
Dr Riek Machar, issued an order to all SPLM/A-IO units that as a result of these
agreements, Kit-Gwang forces are now part of the SSPDF, and as such
SPLM/A-IO forces should observe the ceasefire in place.

b. At the CTSAMVM Technical Committee (CTC) meeting on 23 February 2022
the Acting Senior Representative of the ITGoNU/SSPDF stated that “Kit
Gwang, we signed an agreement with them and we are not denying this.........
That is why even the Chairman of the SPLM/A-IO wrote a very good message
to everyone.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">Although we have not yet fully integrated them but the process is
ongoing.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">They are here in Juba;</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">they are not here idle;</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">they are discussing how
to be integrated”.

</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">c. In July 2022 reported disagreements between forces loyal to Gen Simon
Gatwech (SPLM/A-IO Kit-Gwang) and forces loyal to Gen Johnson Olony
(Agwelek) led to violent clashes and displacement of civilians in Upper Nile
State to the west of Malakal.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">The clashes spread from Upper Nile State into
northern Jonglei State.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">The consequences of the fighting have been severe for
civilians;</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">large numbers have been displaced, humanitarian supp  rt has been
disrupted and freedom of movement obstructed.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">The so-called hae Army”

and other local armed civilian groups became involved, and allegations were
made that Parties to the R-ARCSS were also involved in the fighting.

d.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">At the CTC meeting on 31 October the ITGoNU/SSPDF representatives were
asked to clarify the status of the Agwelek and SPLM/A-IO Kit-Gwang forces.
</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">Despite this request, which was also repeated at the CTC meeting of 
December 2022 and became a resolution of the 34” and 35 CTSAMVM
Board meetings, CTSAMVM has yet to receive any information from ITGoNU
or the SSPDF about the status of the Agwelek Forces and the SPLM/A-IO Kit-
Gwang.

2. Allegations and Incidents:</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">Specific allegations and incidents covered in this report
are:</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">

a. Fighting in Tonga on 15 August 2022.

b. Attacks by Agwelek forces against SPLM/A-IO positions in Diel, Dor and New
Fangak on 18-20 August 2022, and subsequent reprisal attacks by “White
Army” forces against Tonga.

</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">c. Facilitation of the movement of Agwelek forces by the SSPDF prior to the
attacks of 18-20 August 2022.

<p><a id="39" name="39">Aim</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">:</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">The aim of this report is to present the findings of CTSAMVM investigations

<p><a id="42" name="42">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">

a. July to December 2022:</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">CTSAMVM was initially limited in the scope of
investigations because of lack of helicopter support.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">However, between July
and December 2022 CTSAMVM monitored the situation closely, maintained
contact with key stakeholders and met witnesses when they could in the
Malakal area.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">During this period CTSAMVM interacted with a wide range of
stakeholders including Upper Nile State administrators, the Acting Governor of
Upper Nile State, Fashoda and Panyikang County Commissioners, IDPs from
Tonga and Adidiang, the commander of  Division SSPDF, the commander of
SPLM/A-IO forces in Diel, civilians wounded at Tonga and victims of attacks at
Adidiang and Yuom, International NGO’s and UNMISS.

b. Long Duration Patrol 15-17 December 2022:</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">CTSAMVM undertook a Long
Duration Patrol (LDP) between 15-17 December 2022 visiting Old Fangak,
New Fangak and Diel.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">During the LDP CTSAMVM met and interviewed over
25 witnesses including public officials, RRC, IDP’s, local and International
NGO's, Fangak County Commissioner, women’s group and child protection
representatives, traditional leaders, police and the Commander and senior
officers of SPLM/A-IO  Division.

</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">c. National Monitor participation:</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">National Monitors were involved throughout,
and were present at all interviews.

d. Standard of Proof:</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">The standard of proof used by CTSAMVM to determine
whether there is sufficient evidence to verify that a Party is not in compliance
with the provisions of the Agreements is “reasonable grounds to believe that
the incident that is the subject of the investigation occurred.”</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">This is in
accordance with accepted practice for monitoring mechanisms and human-
rights- and humanitarian- entities and signifies that sufficient facts and
evidence have been collected to conclude that a DEN mnt Ras occurred.

<p><a id="58" name="58">Scope:</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">The situation in Upper Nile State and northern Jonglei State is complex.
</a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">The relationship between Party Signatories and local armed groups is obscure,
|                    and the line between political and tribal issues is often blurred.</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">This report focuses
on those events which CTSAMVM can confirm through corroboration by multiple
sources, and seen through the lens of the R-ARCSS.
</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">Findings
7.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Disagreements between SPLM/A-IO Kit-Gwang and Agwelek forces on or about
 July 2022 led to the conflict which has been taking place in Upper Nile and
northern Jonglei States since that time.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">The fighting started in Tonga in July 2022
when SPLM/A-IO Kit-Gwang forces were displaced from Tonga by Agwelek forces.
</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">The conflict then spread.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">There was considerable civilian displacement.
8.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">On 15 August 2022 Agwelek forces in Tonga were attacked.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">The composition of
the attacking forces is not clear:</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">witnesses gave contradictory information.
</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">However, all witnesses agreed that armed groups described as “White Army” were
involved.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">This attack was repulsed after heavy fighting.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">The attack resulted in an
unspecified number of casualties and considerable civilian displacement.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">On 
October 2022 CTSAMVM interviewed survivors of the attack who had taken refuge
in the Malakal POC site, who gave contradictory and confusing statements about
the composition of the attacking forces, but confirmed the scale and results of the
fighting.
9.</a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">On 18, 19 & 20 August 2022 Agwelek forces, reportedly under the command of
“Maj Gen Paroma Angui’, attacked SPLM/A-IO areas in Diel, Dor, New Fangak
and Joukom.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">The force was reportedly in  or  barges.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">Buildings were burnt, and
a number of civilians killed, including  fishermen at Joukom.
</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">10.On 22 September 2022 CTSAMVM met with the commander of  Division SSPDF,
Maj Gen Moses Makuol Ajang.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">He stated that on or about 19 August 2022 he
received orders from Juba to facilitate the movement of  barges carrying Agwelek
|                forces from Renk to Atar.</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">He did as he was ordered, and escorted the barges to

                                                   KX
their destination.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">He also said that SSPDF was given an order “not to be involved
in the fight between the  Kit-Gwang factions, but only defend themselves when
attacked”.
</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">|
11.The attacks by Agwelek forces on SPLM/A-IO areas elicited a reaction from local
armed groups, referred to as “White Army”.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">Following the attacks of 18 - 20 August
“White Army” groups attacked Agwelek forces in the Tonga area, which led to
sporadic fighting for several weeks and the displacement of the Agwelek forces.
             </a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">12.When interviewed on 16 December 2022 the Fangak County Commissioner
specifically told CTSAMVM that SPLM/A-IO forces were involved “together with
their youths (“White Army’)” in the attacks against Agwelek forces in Tonga
following the Agwelek attacks of 18-20 August 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">Maj Gen Samuel Jok, the
deputy commander of  Division SPLM/A-IO was with County Commissioner at the
time and agreed with all he said.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">On 17 December 2022 CTSAMVM met the
leadership of  Division SPLM/A-IO in Diel.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">The main interlocutor was Maj Gen
Stephen Gawar, the deputy in charge of administration and finance, but the
commander, Maj Gen Simon Diang Duoth, and other senior officers were also
present.</a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">At this meeting the SPLM/A-IO said that they “only fought in self-defence”.
</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">13.</a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">Civilians displaced by the fighting in Tonga on 15 August 2022 fled to New Fangak
and Adidiang.</a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">According to witnesses interviewed by CTSAMVM, Adidiang was
reportedly attacked by “Nuer White Army from Diel” on 18 August 2022 and again
on  September 2022.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">Civilians — mainly Shilluk - caught in the attacks at Adidiang
were forced to take shelter in the POC site at Malakal.
</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">|
14.CTSAMVM received reports of further attacks by Agwelek forces based in Atar
against Tonga on  September 2022 and subsequently against Diel, Dor and new
|                   Fangak. SPLM/A-IO  Division claimed they had been shelled by alleged Agwelek
forces at Diel on 17 October 2022.

<p><a id="95" name="95">ITGoNU has stated that efforts are being
                     made to address the root causes of the conflict.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">In a briefing on 30 December 2022

of high-level political leaders to those areas to dialogue on the root causes of the
|                    conflict and secure the peace and stability.”</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">He went on to state that:</a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">“...the conflict
in Upper Nile was an internal dispute between the SPLM-IO Kit-Gwang faction of
General Simon Gatwech and the Agwelek forces of General Johnson Olony.”
Assessment
16.It is CTSAMVMs assessment that the Khartoum agreements of 16 January 2022
established a relationship between ITGoNU/SSPDF and the SPLM/IO Kit-Gwang
and Agwelek forces.
</a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">17.CTSAMVM has been concerned about the status of the command of forces
included in the Khartoum agreements since the CTC meeting of 31 October 2022.
</a></p>
<p><a id="102" name="102">CTSAMVM has received no clarification from SSPDF or ITGoNU about the status
of Agwelek and SPLM/A-IO Kit-Gwang forces, but it is the assessment of
CTSAMVM that the facilitation of the movement of Agwelek forces by the SSPDF
during or prior to the attacks against SPLM/A-IO positions on 18-20 August 2022
demonstrates a clear relationship, and also confirms an affiliation/alliance and
                    therefore the responsibility of the SSPDF for the actions of the Agwelek forces.
</a></p>
<p><a id="103" name="103">18.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">The attacks by Agwelek forces against SPLM/A-IO positions on 18-20 August 2022
demonstrated that the conflict was not confined to an “internal dispute between the
SPLM-IO Kit-Gwang faction of General Simon Gatwech and the Agwelek forces of
|                   General Johnson Olony’” as claimed by ITGoNU in the briefing given by the Deputy
Minister of Foreign Affairs on 30 December 2022.
19.It is the assessment of CTSAMVM that no regular SSPDF forces have been
involved in any of the fighting in Upper Nile State and northern Jonglei State.
</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">|             20.It is the assessment of CTSAMVM that SPLM/A-IO forces were involved in

<p><a id="109" name="109">At time of writing CTSAMVM has not

SPLM/A-IO Kit-Gwang.

Conclusion
22.By</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">facilitating the movement of Agwelek forces prior to their attacks against
SPLM/A-IO areas on 18-20 August 2022 the SSPDF acted in clear violation of the
R-ARCSS, specifically articles 2.1.10.0  and 2.0.10.0.2.
</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">23.Under article 2.0.4  of the R-ARCSS:</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">“The Permanent Ceasefire shall apply to all
|                    forces of the warring parties and all other forces or militias allied to either Party...”
the SSPDF clearly have a relationship with the Agwelek forces and as a result are
responsible for their actions, and therefore in violation of articles 2.1.10.0, 2.0.10.0 
         and 2.0.10.0.2  of the R-ARCSS for the 18-20 August 2022 attacks by Agwelek
forces.
