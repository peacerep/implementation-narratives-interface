<p><a id="6" name="6">It was
decided that in this instance no further action was required, as the issues involved
were for local civil and military authorities to address.</a></p>

CTSAMM REPORT NUMBER 028
ALLEGED VIOLATIONS IN DIGALA BOMA

1.      </a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">Allegations and investigations

1.1  In line with the Peace Agreement that Juba should be demilitarized and SPLA
units relocated 25 km away from the city, 700 soldiers of the  Division were
redeployed to Digala Boma, Rajaf County in Central Equatoria without
informing and consulting the community elders and chiefs in advance.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">This took
place in March 2016.

1.2  The local people accused the SPLA soldiers of taking their land, looting crops
and materials, harassment and displacement of local villagers.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">In particular,
there were credible reports of the attempted rape of two women.

1.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">General concerns over the behaviour of SPLA soldiers were raised by the Chief
of Digala Boma, who sent complaint letters to JMEC, and by the County
Commissioner who sent his personal report to the State Governor.</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">The police
also submitted a security investigation report.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">These concerns were
communicated to CTSAMM and the JUBA MVT were instructed to conduct an
investigation.

1.4  Aninterim report was presented to the CTSAMM meeting on  June 2016.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">The
question was asked whether this was an issue for CTSAMM under the PCTSA:</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">
at the time representatives from the SPLM/A-IO asked that the investigation
should be continued and a report completed.

1.5  The Juba MVT had undertaken extensive investigations and spoken to all
stakeholders involved, but further work on this issue was interrupted by the

events of July 2016, after which the troops concerned moved from the
redeployment site.

2.       </a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">Assessment and conclusion

2.0  There is no doubt that the lives of civilians living in Digala were significantly
affected by the presence of the SPLA soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">There is also no doubt that the
discipline of these soldiers was bad.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">They were also not well administered,
which led to their stealing food from the local people and harassing women.
</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The MVT concluded that the alleged attempted rape did take place, but that it
was not possible to identify the perpetrators.

2.1| CTSAMM concluded that the issues between the civil population in Digala and
the SPLA garrison should be dealt with by local civil and military authorities
rather than under the PCTSA.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">With people in other parts of the country
suffering so much it would not have been right to continue with the
investigation.

3.    </a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">Recommendations

3.0.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">Planned cantonment sites remain an option for the future implementation of the
PCTSA.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">When such sites are established, it is important that they are kept
away from civilian settlements, and that every effort is made to ensure the
troops remain disciplined and good relations are maintained with local
communities.
