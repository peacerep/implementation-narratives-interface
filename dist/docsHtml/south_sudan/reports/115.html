Your Excellencies,
Prior to the signing of the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities, Protection of Civilians
and Humanitarian Access (21 December 2017), CTSAMM prepared this report on
Child Soldiers following a long investigation and with the cooperation of a wide range
of stakeholders.
</a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">We are publishing the report now in order to highlight the continuing and very important
issue of Child Soldiers as the ACOH is being implemented.

CTSAMM REPORT 2018/02
CHILD SOLDIERS
Executive Summary
The employment and use of Child Soldiers is proscribed by the old ARCSS, the IHL
and reiterated in the new ACOH Article 3.2.f.</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">CTSAMM has been monitoring reports
of Child Soldiers in a number of locations in South Sudan for some months.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">The
presence of Child Soldiers has been verified in Western Bahr el Ghazal, Jonglei and
Central Equatoria States.
</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">There is evidence that in some cases the parties are making efforts to return Child
Soldiers to their families, however the presence of Child Soldiers and frequent reports
of recruitment provide sufficient grounds to find that Parties to the conflict remain in
violation of all agreements in this respect.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">The signing of and implementation of the ACOH provides an opportunity to emphasise
this issue, and call on the Parties to take positive steps to stop all employment and
recruitment of Child Soldiers.

1.0  Introduction

1.1.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">
•</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">The presence of Child Soldiers in South Sudan is a long running problem.

</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">In 2012 a joint SPLA / UN action plan for halting the use of children by the
SPLA was launched.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">In the course of their routine monitoring activities;</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">CTSAMM MVTs come
across anecdotal evidence that parties have been recruiting and making use
of Child Soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">These reports have been followed up by targeted patrols
and investigations to establish the facts.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">As a result MVTs Yei, Pibor and
Wau have primary evidence of the presence of Child Soldiers in three
states, and other MVTs have come across enough anecdotal evidence to
Suggest the recruitment and employment of Child Soldiers goes on
throughout the country.

1.2  Aim:</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">The aim of this short report is to highlight the continued use of child
soldiers by the Parties in South Sudan, and to ask all parties what measures
they are taking to combat and eradicate this practice.

1.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">Methodology:</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">Reports of the use of Child Soldiers have been received from Community
Liaison Officers and a wide range of other sources within MVT areas of
operation.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">HQ CTSAMM tasked all MVTs to conduct follow up investigations
in order to gain primary evidence.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">CTSAMM staff experienced in child soldier issues liaised closely with
relevant international organisations.

2.0  Findings

2.1  Pibor:</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">In July 2017 CTSAMM received reports of Child Soldiers within the
ranks of SPLA-IO (TD) forces in the area of Pibor.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">On 11  July 2017
International Observers from MVT Pibor met an  SPLA-IO (TD) senior

2)
commander who had been authorised by his chain of command to discuss the
issue and to compile lists of Child Soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">He informed the MVT of the
presence of 300 Child Soldiers in SPLA-IO (TD) forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">The Child Soldiers
were reported to come from Gumuluk, Pibor Town.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">It is reported that the Child
Soldiers were enticed into the SPLA-IO (RM) with promises of food for their
families following the fighting following on from the start of the conflict in
December 2013.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">The faction of the SPLA-IO (RM) involved in the control and
administration of the Child Soldiers changed allegiance to SPLA-IO (TD) in
April 2017.

2.2  Following disclosure of the presence of Child Soldiers UNMISS agencies
have been verifying the numbers and names of Child Soldiers and MVT Pibor
has witnessed these events.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">The MVT received a list of 480 Child Soldiers
amounting on 11 July 2017 and received  more lists in August 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">The
total number declared in the Pibor area stands at 590.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">A verification
exercise to match names to the lists is ongoing.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">UNMISS Child protection
agencies and the SPLA are working to finalise the verification.

2.3.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">Masna.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">On 30 Sep MVT Wau received an allegation that there were Child
Soldiers amongst the SPLA-IO (TD) forces assembling at Masna following
their change of allegiance from SPLA-IO (RM).</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">MVT Wau made multiple
requests to visit the site through SPLA-IO (TD) liaison officers but it was not
until 23 Nov 2017 that a patrol was conducted.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">The patrol met with senior
commanders at the site who confirmed that there were Child Soldiers within
their ranks.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">The Child Soldiers were referred to as the “Red Army” and were
reported to be based at WADEHELO.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">The patrol met some soldiers at Masna
who appeared to be children but have not yet visited Wadehelo.

2.4  Yei Area.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">From -17 August MVT Yei conducted a patrol to Yei, Goli, Kaya
and Lasu.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">On 15 August while en route to Lasu the MVT and UNMISS convoy
was stopped at a checkpoint at Kergulu village  km from Yei.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">The
checkpoint was manned by poorly disciplined and poorly trained Mathiang
Anoor personnel.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">Following conversations with the checkpoint personnel it
was confirmed by International Observers that the soldiers were from Twic,

Aweil and Warrap and amongst those manning the checkpoint there were
children as young as 13 years old.

2.5  Unconfirmed Reports.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">In addition to the verified cases above there continue
to be widespread reports of ongoing recruitment of Child Soldiers in Western
Equatoria, Unity and Upper Nile states.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">UNMISS is conducting verification
exercises the results of which should be available in January 2018.

3.0  Assessment:</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">

3.1  Itis assessed that SPLA, SPLA-IO (TD) and SPLA-IO (RM) have recruited and
used Child Soldiers in the current conflict.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">In Masna and Pibor the presence
of Child Soldiers was admitted by SPLA-IO (TD) and it is likely that their
recruitment was conducted by SPLA-IO (RM).</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">In the Yei area the deployment
of the Mathiang Anoor with Child Soldiers is the responsibility of the SPLA and
has been verified by International Observers.

3.2  It is assessed that the recruitment and use of Child Soldiers in South Sudan is
underreported.

3.3  Inrecruiting and employing Child Soldiers the SPLA, SPLA-IO (TD) and SPLA-
 (RM) are in clear violation of international and  national law and all
agreements pertaining to the current conflict.

4.0  Observations and Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">

4.1  It is recognized that in the case of the Child Soldiers in Pibor the SPLA-IO (TD)
are co-operating with international organizations working on Child Protection in
South Sudan to return the children to families and to remove them from the
military forces.

4.2_ Itis very disappointing that parties continue to commit such violations especially
since SPLA and SPLA-IO recommitted to the Joint SPLA/UN action plan
following the outbreak of hostilities in December 2013.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">On 24 June 2014 the
SPLA reaffirmed their commitment to the action plan and on 27 Dec 2015 the
SPLA-IO followed on and also reaffirmed their commitment.

4.3  Itis recommended that:</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">

•</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">With the signing and implementation of the ACOH all Parties reaffirm their
commitment to eradicate the recruitment and employment of Child Soldiers,
and inform CTSAMM of this and their plans for dealing with the issue.

•</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">All parties identify and declare Child Soldiers in the ranks of their military
forces so the appropriate actions can be taken to demobilise and return
them to their families.
