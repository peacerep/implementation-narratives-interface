Barracks followed up the National Minister for Mining and intercepted him at

the scene of the event before they drove off with him to Loa Barracks under

Incident

4.</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">On 15 April 2022 at about 1500hrs, the Honourable Minister for Mining Maj Gen
Martin Gama Abucha left Juba in a convoy of three (3) vehicles travelling to
Uganda to attend the funeral of a relative.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">At around 1800 hrs, the Minister called
the Ashwa Cantonment Site Commander, Brig Gen George Okeny informing him
that he was going to spend the night at the Cantonment.

5.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">The Cantonment Site Commander told CTSAMVM that he received information
saying that a land cruiser had been dispatched from Tiger Joint Operations Loa
Barracks with soldiers and had driven to Ashwa junction and parked there for
about 15 minutes.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">The land cruiser left back to Loa Barracks leaving behind the
soldiers at the junction.</a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">When the Hon minister arrived at the junction and
passed, the soldiers were still there.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">The soldiers did not do anything as the
Minister passed them.</a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">The Minister arrived at the Cantonment Site at around
1900 hrs and spent the night there.

6.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">The Minister's convoy left the Cantonment Site the following morning on 16 April
at around 0645hrs.

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">The Minister and his entourage arrived at Numule at 0730hrs and went to the
house of his uncle Honourable Jerema Gama Suru to greet him and take tea with
him.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">After about 15 minutes, an SSPDF armed convoy of about four vehicles came to
the house of Hon Jerema.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">On arrival, the occupants asked the driver of the
Minister (who was parked outside) to tell them who he was driving.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">The driver
informed them that he was with the Minister of Mining Hon Martin Gama Abucha,
traveling to Uganda.

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">They asked for travel authorization document which the driver showed them.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">The
SSPDF soldiers told the driver that they had no information about his travel and
therefore the Minister should be taken back to Loa Barracks.

10.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">When the driver informed the Minister of the need to go back to Loa Barracks, the
Minister called the convoy leader and asked him his names and rank.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">The convoy
leader replied that there was no need for him to tell the Minister his names.

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">When the Minister asked him what was happening, the convoy leader replied that
they had received information from Military intelligence in Juba that a Minister
was traveling to Uganda and that they had been instructed not to let the Minister
pass.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">The leader of the convoy insisted that they should go back to Loa Barracks.

12.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">The Minister introduced himself to the convoy leader as the Government Minister
of Mining and that his travel was legal and if there was anything to sort out they
sort it at Nimule instead of going back to Loa Barracks.

13.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">The convoy leader got angry and called in his soldiers.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">According to the eye
witness, the soldiers came in the house with their guns, grabbed the Minister by
the neck and both hands and slapped him twice.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">They attempted to bundle him
into a pick-up vehicle but his bodyguards and driver insisted that the Minister will
not enter the pick-up rather he follows them in his official vehicle.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">At this point, the
Minister together with the five (5) other people who included his security guard
and driver were taken by the SSPDF soldiers to Loa Barracks.

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">During the scuffle, the mobile phones of the Minister's Body guard were broken.
</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">Arriving at Loa, the Minister was separated from his Body guard and driver and
collected their mobile phones, which were returned after about 15 minutes.

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">While at Loa Barracks, the Minister requested to speak with the Commander who
took responsibility of his arrest, he was informed that he had left.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">It was later
established that Lt Col Atem Mading was in charge at the time because the
Commander was not present.

</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">Assessment

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">It is not clear whether the Minister was stopped at Loa Junction by Joint
Operations Forces and refused to stop as claimed by the SSPDF Deputy Joint
Operations Commander.

17.</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70">Even though Maj Santino and his Joint Operations Tiger Forces may not have
been aware of the identity of the people in the Minister's convoy when it arrived at
the Loa check point on 15 April, it is apparently clear that they became fully
aware that it was the Hon Minister's convoy when it turned at the Ashwa Junction
and went into Ashwa Cantonment Site.

18.</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">When Maj Santino ordered his forces to pursue the Minister's convoy on the
morning of 16 April, he was aware that the convoy belonged to the Minister and
specifically tasked them to look for the Minister, arrest him and bring him back to
Loa Barracks.

19.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">The arrest of the Minister was conducted  in a violent manner that was
disrespectful to the person of the Minister.

20.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">The operation to arrest the Minister was coordinated from a higher office in Juba
because both the convoy Commander who arrested the Minister from Nimule and
the Deputy Commander of the Loa Joint Operations along Juba — Nimule road
and Maj William Santino,  during their engagements with CTSAMVM  kept
referring to orders from Juba.  </a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">Maj William Santino initially stated that, “I am not
willing to speak to CTSAMVM team until | receive  instructions from my
headquarters in Juba’.

21.</a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">There could have been a deliberate intention to humiliate the Hon Minister in front
of his own people.

22.</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">The arrest, detention and assaulting the Minister was a serious provocation that
could lead to a fire-fight.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">The Ashwa Cantonment Site Commander, Brig Gen

Okeny told CTSAMVM categorically that “had the Hon Minister been detained for
more than six (6) hours then | would have launched a major attack on the Loa
Barracks and the situation could have deteriorated severely”.

Conclusions

23.</a></p>
<p><a id="78" name="78">CTSAMVM concludes that the SSPDF violated the following provisions of the R-
ARCSS:</a></p>
<p><a id="79" name="79">Articles 2.1.10.0, 2.0.10.0  and Article 2.0.10.0.

24.</a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">CTSAMVM concludes that the SSPDF violated the following provisions of the
ACOH:</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">Articles (i), 3. (3).

Recommendations

25.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">It is recommended that SSPDF takes urgent action to ensure free and safe
movement of all citizens irrespective of their social status.

26.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">CTSAMVM recommends that RUMEC and JDB establish “from Juba” who issued
the order to arrest the Minister so that necessary action is taken to avoid such
incidents from repeating.

27.</a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">It is recommended that the SSPDF holds Major William Santino and Lt Col Atem
Mading accountable for their actions on 16 April subject them to pertinent judicial
and/or administrative  disciplinary processes, as  required pursuant to ACoH
Articles 3.0(“The Parties shall prevent, and ensure accountability for breaches of
this Agreement.”) and 13 (“Parties shall  prevent, investigate and ensure
accountability for breaches of this Agreement.”) AND as required by R-ARCSS
Article 2.0.10.0.3(Party-signatories are reminded they are obligated for “ensuring
accountability for breaches of this Agreement.”).

28.</a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">It is recommended that the Government/SSPDF operationalise its obligation
under Article 2.0  of the ACOH (ensuring all forces “at all times observe the
Agreement) AND under Article 2.1.3  of the R-ARCSS (ensuring compliance with

the provisions of the Agreement by all of its forces) by establishing training
Programmes on the provisions of the ACOH and R-ARCSS for its forces.

29.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">If is further recommended that all Parties to the Agreements, make use of any
available support to ensure all their personnel receive sufficient training in this
respect.
