INTERIM REPORT ON TENSION AND FIGHTING IN CENTRAL EQUATORIA

STATE FOLLOWING THE CHANGE OF ALLEGIANCE OF MAJOR GENERAL

MOSES LOKOJU

</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">Introduction

1.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">Following the change of allegiance of Maj Gen Moses Lokoju Gabriel (the former
commander of SPLMA-IO Division 2B) to the SSPDF the situation in the Moroto,
Ajio and Kirwa areas has become tense and violent, with at least two clashes at
Moroto Training Centre and allegations by the SPLM/A-IO that the SSPDF have
been involved in supporting the SSPDF-affiliated forces of Maj Gen Lokoju.

2.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">Following an initial attack against Moroto Training Centre on 29 September 2020
steps were taken by|JDB to stop the situation escalating, and various measures
suggested.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">However, none of these measures were implemented and tensions
continued until further fighting broke out in the area of Moroto Training Centre on
26 November 2020.

3.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The issues behind the tensions and violence have not yet been resolved, and at
time of writing CTSAMVM is continuing to receive reports of fighting.

Lokoju had “defedted” to the SSPDF.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">He had reportedly been recalled to Juba
previously by the SPLM/A-IO to answer disciplinary charges.</a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">CTSAMVM later
received a copy of Maj Gen Lokoju’s resignation letter dated 21 September
2020.</a></p>

<p><a id="30" name="30">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">The CTSAMVM MVT in Yei received unsubstantiated information that Maj Gen
Moses Lokoju had returned to the Kajo-Keji area, and was allegedly recruiting
SPLM/A-IO soldiers from the Kuku tribe to change allegiance to the SSPDF.</a></p>

6.</a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">23 September 2020;</a></p>

case of attack, that Maj Gen Lokoju was recruiting members of the Kuku tribe for
the SSPDF and that/he was planning an attack on the Training Centre.

trainees (all of whom are from the SPLM/A-IO) had not been armed.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">However, he
said the security situation was not good since the arrival in the area of Maj Gen
Lokoju who he clai      had been flown to Kajo-Keji in an SSPDF helicopter.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">He
also claimed that Maj Gen Lokujo had been supplied with  armed Land Cruisers
and escorted to Kirwa, which is not far from Moroto.  of Maj Gen Lokoju’s
soldiers had been reportedly captured whilst setting ambushes near the Training
Centre.

8.</a></p>

Brigade Commander (Brig Gen Lual Deng) had given Maj Gen Lokoju a

<p><a id="128" name="128">There
were no signs of fighting at the camp itself, although it was obvious from empty

on 26 November, both directed at the protection force camp.</a></p>

Training Centre itself.</a></p>
<p><a id="139" name="139">The guard force, trainees and instructors all withdrew to
Ajio The Training Site Commander, Brig Gen Peter Wal Choul made it clear
that he would not reoccupy the Training Site until a joint SSPDF/SPLM/A-lO
forces had taken responsibility for security in the area, and SSPDF-affiliated
Maj Gen Lokoju and his forces had been moved from his present location.</a></p>
<p><a id="140" name="140">

•. On 27 November 2020 CTSAMVM received unverified allegations for the
SPLM/A-IO  Brigade commander in Panyume that Maj Gen Lokoju had
attacked Ajio and would probably go on to attack Moroto again.</a></p>
<p><a id="141" name="141">

</a></p>

SPLM/A-IO Senior National Liaison officer that the SSPDF-affiliated forces of
Maj Gen Lokoju had attacked their positions at Ajio.</a></p>

reports from the SPLM/A-IO of further fighting on  December 2020 although
when contacted Maj Gen Lokoju denied this was the case.</a></p>
<p><a id="144" name="144">

</a></p>

<p><a id="146" name="146">Bde Land
Forces in Yei, Brig Gen John Lual, who said he had made arrangements with
the Deputy Commander of the SSPDF Ground Force in Kajo-Keji, Col John
Kamilo, to deploy SSPDF soldiers in Kirwa, Ajio and Mangaltori, so the forces
of Maj Gen Moses Lokujo could be moved elsewhere away from the SPLM/A-
10.</a></p>

Morobo and Panyume.</a></p>
<p><a id="150" name="150">The plan was to proceed to from Panyume to Ajio and
Moroto, but whilst at Panyume information was received from the commander
of Moroto Training Centre (who was in Ajio) that the security situation was not
good there, and so the team postponed the visit and returned to Yei.

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="151" name="151">Observations and Recommendations

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="152" name="152">The change of allegiance of Maj Gen Lokoju has not only created tension in the
Moroto-Ajio-Kirwa area;</a></p>
<p><a id="153" name="153">it has also led to violence and the closure of Moroto
Training Centre.

</a></p>
<p><a id="154" name="154">17.The SSPDF are responsible for the actions of Maj Gen Lokoju, but do not appear
to have exercised any control over his forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="155" name="155">

18.</a></p>
<p><a id="156" name="156">The statement by the commander of SSPDF  Brigade in Yei that he has made
arrangements to deploy forces in Kirwa, Ajio and Magalatore requires urgent
clarification with JDB.</a></p>
<p><a id="157" name="157">Any movement of forces must be coordinated by JDB and
CTSAMVM informed.

19.</a></p>
<p><a id="158" name="158">JDB failed to act in a timely manner after the 29 September attack against Moroto
Training Centre.</a></p>
<p><a id="159" name="159">None of the measures described by the Minister of Defence were
implemented.

20.</a></p>
<p><a id="160" name="160">Recommendations:</a></p>
<p><a id="161" name="161">
</a></p>
<p><a id="162" name="162">a. That JDB takes action to reduce tensions in the area, and confidence-building
measures are implemented as a matter of urgency.
</a></p>
<p><a id="163" name="163">b.</a></p>
<p><a id="164" name="164">That JDB gives clear directions about the deployment and future of the SSPDF-
affiliated forces under control of Maj Gen Lokujo.
