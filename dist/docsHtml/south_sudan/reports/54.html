Executive Summary 

This  Report  which  covers  the  period  from  December  1st,  2017  to  March  31st, 
2018 highlights the status of implementation of the Agreement on the Resolution 
of Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (ARCSS) and the ongoing High Level 
Revitalization  Forum  (HLRF)  convened  by  The  Intergovernmental  Authority  and 
Development  (IGAD)  in  an  effort  to  revitalize  implementation  of  the  Peace 
Agreement.  </a></p>
<p><a id="6" name="6">The  report  presents  observations  and  makes  recommendations 
pursuant to the current peace process in South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="7" name="7">

The  HLRF  was  mandated  to:</a></p>
<p><a id="8" name="8"> (a)  agree  on  concrete  measures  to  restore  the 
permanent ceasefire;</a></p>
<p><a id="9" name="9">(b) return to full implementation of the Peace Agreement;</a></p>
<p><a id="10" name="10">
and  (c)  develop  a  revised  and  realistic  timeline  and  implementation  schedule 
towards democratic elections at the end of the transitional period.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">

The  first  phase  of  the  HLRF,  which  took  place  in  Addis  Ababa,  Ethiopia  from 
December 5th – 21st, 2017 resulted in the signing of an Agreement on Cessation 
of Hostilities, Protection of Civilians and Humanitarian Access (CoHA).</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">This was 
quickly followed by a workshop aimed at clarifying responsibilities and equipping 
the  parties  with  the  requisite  tools  to  implement  critical  provisions  of  the 
Agreement.  </a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">It  also  developed  specific  modalities  that  would  enable  full 
implementation of the CoHA, and was facilitated by JMEC and the Ceasefire and 
Transitional Security Arrangement Monitoring Mechanism (CTSAMM). 

The  second  phase  of  the  HLRF  was  convened  from  February  5th  to  16th,  2018, 
with  delegates  agreeing  on  a  set  of  principles  designed  to  guide  their 
deliberations at the HLRF.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">Deliberations were also held on Chapters I and II of 
the ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">Agreement was reached on several articles in Chapter 1 including on 
the  mandate  of  a  restructured  TGoNU;</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16"> the  establishment  and  expansion  of 
Transitional  Institutions  and  Mechanisms;</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17"> and  National  Elections.  </a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">Other  issues 
such as reforms of the Judiciary and a time frame for the pre-Transitional Period, 
and on the expansion of membership of the National Constitutional Amendment 
Committee (NCAC) were only partially agreed.</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">

With  regard  to  Chapter  II,  deliberations  were  held  on  the  provisions  of  the 
permanent  ceasefire;</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">
separation,  assembly  and  cantonment;</a></p>

<p><a id="23" name="23">Whereas agreement was reached on some issues, there remain 
some outstanding issues on which discussion will resume in the next session of 

v 

the  Forum.    </a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">It  is  expected  that  the  parties  will  engage  in  discussions  on  the 
outstanding  issues  and  reach  compromise  to  advance  progress  during  the  next 
phase of the forum.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">Other substantive issues to be discussed in the forthcoming session of the HLRF 
set for April 26 - 30 2018, once Chapter I and II are concluded, will include the 
incorporation  of  consequential  amendments,  development  of  a  revised  and 
realistic  implementation  schedule  of  all  chapters  of  the  ARCSS  and  a  schedule 
towards  a  democratic  election  in  South  Sudan  at  the  end  of  the  transitional 
period;</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">implementation and oversight mechanism for the revitalized ARCSS and 
resource mobilization mechanism for implementation. 

The humanitarian situation remains dire with approximately 4.25 million people 
displaced, 2.4 million of whom have taken refuge in neighbouring countries.</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">Food 
insecurity  is  widespread.  </a></p>
<p><a id="28" name="28">It  is  reported  by  the  United  Nations  Office  of  the 
Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs  (UN-OCHA)  that  5.3  million  people  are 
currently  food  insecure,  with  at  least  one  million  those  estimated  to  be  on  the 
brink of famine.</a></p>
<p><a id="29" name="29">Compounding the situation, problems continue to be faced with 
respect  to      the  protection  of  civilians  and  access  to  humanitarian  aid  and 
services  to  those  most  in  need.  </a></p>
<p><a id="30" name="30">On  a  positive  note,  a  cholera  outbreak,  which 
broke out in 2017 was declared over in February 2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="31" name="31">

Regrettably  the  economy  continues  to  experience  a  noticeable  decline 
compounded  by  high  inflation  and  a  deteriorating  exchange  rate.  </a></p>
<p><a id="32" name="32">On  the  fiscal 
front  TGoNU’s  revenues  are  being  severely  affected  as  it  seeks  to  pay  down 
arrears due to the government of Sudan under the Oil Agreement, thus placing a 
tremendous  burden  on  the  government’s  ability  to  meet  its  other  spending 
obligations.  </a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">In that regard, an attempt to increase non-oil revenue through the 
establishment of a Revenue Authority is a welcome first step in  addressing the 
issue.</a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">Overall implementation of Chapter IV is hindered by insufficient resources, 
failure to update key legislation, and in some cases a lack of political will, which 
have served to severely constrain progress.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">Serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law continued 
through 2017 and early 2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">Some of the most egregious violations reported by 
the  Commission  on  Human  Rights  for  South  Sudan  in  March  2018  include 
targeted  killings,  the  recruitment  of  children  by  armed  groups;</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37"> rape  and  gang 
rape of children, women and men, looting and destruction of property.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">The near 
total absence of accountability for these crimes has encouraged their continued 
perpetration.</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">Accountability measures and mechanisms proposed in Chapter V of 
the ARCSS are yet to be established.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">Impunity has become entrenched thereby 
complicating prospects for healing and reconciliation.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">

The Chairperson  of  the  JMEC  continued  his  engagement  with  the  TGoNU, 
particularly  with  H.E.  Salva  Kiir  Mayardit,  President  of  the  Republic  of  South 
Sudan and H.E. General Taban Deng Gai, the First Vice President.</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">There was also 
engagement  in  further  diplomatic  missions  with  the  leadership  of  the  United 
Nations, the African Union Commission (AUC), IGAD, and the various dedicated 
Special Envoys, all with the intention of finding a path out of the current crisis.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">

The success of the revitalization process is hugely dependent on the exercise of 
political will by the South Sudanese Parties and their willingness to compromise. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">IGAD must remain actively engaged during and in-between sessions of the HLRF 
at  the  highest  level.  </a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">Much  has  been  achieved  already,  and  IGAD,  AU  and  the 
United  Nations  should  work  collaboratively  with  the  parties  to  ensure  that 
momentum for dialogue is not lost.</a></p>

The Intergovernmental Authority and Development Extra-Ordinary Summit 
of Heads of State and Government of  June 12th, 2017 agreed to convene 
a  High-Level  Revitalization  Forum  (HLRF)  of  the  parties  to  ARCSS, 
including  estranged  groups,  with  the  key  objectives  of:</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52"> (a)  agreeing  on 
concrete  measures  to  restore  the  permanent  ceasefire;</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53"> (b)  returning  to 
full implementation of the Peace Agreement;</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">and (c) developing a revised 
and  realistic  timeline  and  implementation  schedule  towards  democratic 
elections at the end of the transitional period. 

The Summit mandated the IGAD Council of Ministers to urgently convene 
and facilitate the HLRF.</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">JMEC and IGAD Secretariat were tasked to provide 
the necessary secretariat and logistical support to the HLRF process.</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">H.E 
Dr. Ismail Wais was also appointed the Special Envoy for South Sudan and 
mandated  by  the  IGAD  Council  of  Ministers  to  coordinate  the  process. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Four JMEC advisors (Governance, Security, Legal and Transitional Justice) 
and  JMEC’s  staff  have  been  dedicated  to  the  Special  Envoy’s  office  to 
provide technical and  logistical support as required.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">During the reporting 
period,  the  IGAD  Council  of  Ministers  with  support  of  the  IGAD  Special 
Envoy  and  the  HLRF  Taskforce  has  convened  two  sessions  of  the  HLRF.  
These  sessions  were  held  in  December  2017  and  February  2018 
respectively, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. 

5. 

In preparation of the launch of the HLRF, IGAD appointed three high-level 
facilitators for the Forum;</a></p>
<p><a id="59" name="59">H.E. Ramtane Lamamra, High Representative of 
the Chairperson of AU Commission for Silencing the Guns in Africa, former 
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Algeria, and former Commissioner for Peace

<p><a id="60" name="60"> H.E  Hanna  Serwaah  Tetteh,  former 
Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  of  Ghana,  and  H.E  Georges  Rebello  Chikoti, 
former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Angola.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">During the first phase of the Forum, deliberations focused on achieving a 
cessation of hostilities and culminated in the signing of an Agreement on 
Cessation  of  Hostilities,  Protection  of  Civilians  and  Humanitarian  Access 
(CoHA) on December 21st, 2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">The signing of the CoHA was witnessed 
by  other  South  Sudanese  stakeholders,  regional  guarantors,  and  others 
including  international  partners.  </a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">The  COHA  has  contributed  to  the 
reduction of fighting even though violations have occurred.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">Related  to  the  implementation  of  the  CoHA,  a  follow-up  workshop 
facilitated  by  JMEC  and 
the  Ceasefire  and  Transitional  Security 
Arrangement Monitoring Mechanism (CTSAMM) was held on January 24th - 
25th,  2018,  in  Addis  Ababa,  Ethiopia  with  the  aim  of  clarifying 
responsibilities  and  equipping  the  parties  with  the  requisite  tools  to 
implement  critical  provisions  of  the  Agreement.  </a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">The  workshop  also 
developed specific modalities that would enable full implementation of the 
CoHA. 

The second phase of the Forum, convened from February 5th – 16th, 2018, 
kicked  off  with  deliberations  on  the  Declaration  of  Principles  (DoP)  to 
guide  the  dialogue.  </a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">The  Forum  deliberated  on  governance  (Chapter  I  of 
the  ARCSS);</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67"> and  Permanent  Ceasefire  and  Transitional  Security 
Arrangements  (Chapter  II  of  the  ARCSS).  </a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">The  outcomes  of  the 
deliberations  included  full,  partial  and  pending  agreements  on  provisions 
of the articles of the DoP as well on chapter I and II of the ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">The 
parties agreed on 27 principles of the DoP but TGoNU objected to principle 
28  on  accountability  for  spoilers  and  violators  and  consequently  did  not 
sign the DoP.  

On  chapter  I,  the  Parties  deliberated  and  agreed  on  the  mandate  of  a 
restructured  TGoNU;</a></p>
<p><a id="70" name="70"> the  establishment  and  expansion  of  Transitional 
Institutions and Mechanisms;</a></p>
<p><a id="71" name="71">and on National Elections.</a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">There was partial 
agreement on provisions on the reform of the Judiciary and a time frame 
for the pre-transitional period and on the mandate and composition of the 
National Constitutional Amendment Committee (NCAC).</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">There were widely 
divergent views and disagreement on provisions relating to responsibility 
sharing, the structure of the state and government, and on the size and 
composition of the Legislature.

<p><a id="74" name="74">With  regard  to  Chapter  II  of  the  ARCSS,  a  technical  sub-committee  on

<p><a id="84" name="84">Ambassador Anas Eltayeb Elgailani 
Mustafa  was  appointed  as  the  Deputy  Chairperson  of  the  NCAC  by  the 
Sudan  Government  replacing  Ambassador  Hassan  Ali  Hassan  who  has 
been appointed as Sudan’s Ambassador to The Netherlands.  

13. 

The  NCAC  has  made  commendable  progress  in  the  review  and 
amendment of key National Security related legislation as required by the 
Peace  Agreement.  </a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">During  the  month  of  December  2017,  the  Committee 
continued with the review and finalization of the Amendment Bills to the 
five (5) Security Laws.</a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">These were handed over to the Minister of Justice 
and Constitutional Affairs on January 25th, 2018 in accordance with Article 
13.1.2  of  the  ARCSS.  </a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">The  submitted  Bills  include:</a></p>

In  January  2018,  NCAC  provided  a  detailed  report  to  JMEC  on  the 
approach,  methodology  and  process  of  carrying  out  the  amendments  to 
the Security Laws.  </a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">This methodology included consultations with experts 
and all stakeholders.</a></p>

<p><a id="92" name="92">In January 2018, the Committee met with and received joint submissions 
on  proposed  amendments  to  the  Political  Parties  Act,  2012  and  the 
National  Elections  Act,  2012,  from  representatives  of  12  of  the  14 
registered political parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">The NCAC has since completed an initial review 
of these two laws incorporating the submissions received from the parties 
and  stakeholders.  </a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">A  stakeholders  meeting  has  subsequently  been 
scheduled for May to validate the proposed amendments.

<p><a id="95" name="95">During  this  reporting  period,  JMEC  supported  a  workshop  by  the  South 
Sudan Chamber of Commerce for the NCAC to share information with the 
business community on their work.</a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">This interaction was especially useful

Still pending however is the ratification of  bills including the Constitution 
Amendment Bill (2018) and the Security Bills by the Transitional National 
Legislature  (TNLA).  </a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">Also  pending  is  the  reconstitution  of  several 
transitional  institutions  and  mechanisms,  including  the  Political  Parties 
Council  and  National  Elections  Commission,  which  are  critical  for  paving 
way  for  the  registration  of  political  parties,  and  the  preparation  and 
conduct  of  elections  at  the  end  of  the  Transitional  Period.  </a></p>
<p><a id="100" name="100">These  are  all 
tasks that will require a considerable amount of time and resources to be

Fighting  between  government  and  opposition  forces  has  continued 
sporadically  in  different  parts  of  the  country.  </a></p>
<p><a id="101" name="101">The  main  highways  and 
commercial  transit  arteries  especially  South  Sudan-Uganda  and  South 
Sudan-  Kenya  remain  dangerous  due  to  the  large  number  of  robberies, 
ambushes and physical assaults including killings.</a></p>

Cessation  of  Hostilities,  Protection  of  Civilians  and  Humanitarian  Access 
Agreement in order to end the fighting in South Sudan.</a></p>
<p><a id="104" name="104">Despite significant

<p><a id="188" name="188">Much  rests  on  the  successful  conclusion  of  the  HLRF  and  an  urgent

economic  growth  and  development.  </a></p>
<p><a id="189" name="189">The  economy  of  South  Sudan  and 
ultimately  its  people  can  only  truly  begin  to  experience  meaningful 
development  in  the  absence  of  war  and  in  a  focused  effort  to  stimulate 
agriculture production, improve oil and other revenue sources, and expand 
the private sector’s role in development.

loom  as  major  threats  to  the  economic  stability  of  the  country.

<p><a id="191" name="191">Consequently,  continuing  efforts  by  TGoNU  to  improve  and  streamline 
expenditure  management,  eliminate  the  fuel  subsidy,  consolidate  and 
reduce domestic arrears, establish the NRA, enact appropriate legislation, 
and limit borrowing from the Central Bank can have the impact of further 
improving economic stability and setting the stage for future growth.</a></p>

The  last  JMEC  Plenary  was  held  on  November  20th,  2017.  </a></p>
<p><a id="222" name="222">During  this 
plenary, the Chairperson of JMEC, in consultation with members agreed to 
postpone  the  December  plenary  to  enable  JMEC  to  dedicate  its  energies 
and resources in support of the IGAD Special Envoy and to focus on the 
convening of the revitalization forum.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="223" name="223">The next JMEC plenary was initially scheduled for end of February 2018. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="224" name="224">However,  following  the  signing  of  the  COHA,  which  called  for  the 
restructuring  and  reconstitution  of  all  Agreement 
institutions  and 
mechanisms,  and  the  subsequent  adjournment  of  Phase  II  of  the  HLRF 
without  full  revitalisation,  the  JMEC  Chairperson  again  postponed  the 
JMEC Plenary, to consult with the IGAD Chairperson and key stakeholders 
in the South Sudan peace process.

<p><a id="225" name="225">The  JMEC  Secretariat  and  the  Chairperson  continues  to  engage  with  all

providing expertise and logistical support to the HLRF process and to the 
Office  of  the  IGAD  Special  Envoy  for  South  Sudan  as  part  of  the  HLRF 
Taskforce, JMEC continues to work with CTSAMM, NCAC, JMCC, SDSR and

submitting  relevant  reports  and  making  recommendations  for  remedial

</a></p>
<p><a id="228" name="228">JMEC has also embarked on aggressive outreach campaign to sensitize the 
population  of  South  Sudan  and  engaging  key  stakeholders  on  the  peace 
process to create awareness, enhance participation and local ownership of 
the  peace  process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="229" name="229">JMEC  Secretariat  has  compiled,  printed  and 
disseminated  over  1000  copies  of  the  new  Agreement  on  Cessation  of

December  21,  2017.</a></p>
<p><a id="230" name="230"> </a></p>
<p><a id="231" name="231">JMEC  Secretariat  has  also  organized  a  series  of

</a></p>
<p><a id="232" name="232">Observations and Recommendations 

Alleged  violations  of  the  December  2017  CoHA  were  investigated  by 
CTSAMM  which  found  that  flagrant  violations  of  the  COHA  had  been 
committed  by  both  the  SPLA-IG  and  SPLM-IO  respectively  over  the 
reporting  period.    </a></p>
<p><a id="233" name="233">CTSAMM  reports  were  submitted  to  IGAD  Council  of 
Ministers and to JMEC.  

</a></p>
<p><a id="234" name="234">The IGAD Council has since decided vide its Communiqué dated March 26, 
2018,  to  impose  targeted  sanctions  against  individual  violators  and  has 
subsequently referred the matter to the AU Peace and Security Council for 
appropriate  punitive  measures.  </a></p>
<p><a id="235" name="235">It  is  up  to  IGAD  and  AU-PSC  to  act  with 
alacrity  to  implement  this  decision  as  a  means  of  stemming  more 
violations that regrettably have continue to be reported since this decision 
was made.   

61.  </a></p>
<p><a id="236" name="236">On deliberations during phase two of the HLRF, a notable lack of trust and 
confidence  between  the  TGoNU  and  the  opposition  groups  presented  an 
obstacle to the parties’ ability to make compromises on important  issues 
on  governance  and  security.    </a></p>
<p><a id="237" name="237">The  issues  on  which  there  are  widely 
divergent  views  can  only  be  resolved  politically,  and  by  the  parties 
recommitting  themselves  to  the  agenda  for  the  revitalization  of  the 
ARCSS. 

62. 

The success of the revitalization process is dependent on the exercise of 
political  will  by  the  South  Sudanese  Parties  and  their  willingness  to 
compromise.</a></p>
<p><a id="238" name="238">IGAD must remain actively engaged during and in-between 
sessions  of  the  HLRF  at  the  highest  level.  </a></p>

already, and IGAD, AU and the United Nations should work collaboratively 
with the parties to ensure that momentum for dialogue is not lost.</a></p>
<p><a id="243" name="243">

In  the  period  between  sessions,  IGAD  should  consider  engaging  the 
antagonistic parties to the HLRF on the issues that have the potential to 
derail the Forum.</a></p>
<p><a id="244" name="244">These issues include but are not limited to;</a></p>
<p><a id="245" name="245">the type of 
security guarantees that could be offered to returning opposition figures;</a></p>

practical measures on how to resolve the question of responsibility sharing 
in government;</a></p>
<p><a id="247" name="247">state structure, and transitional security arrangements. 

The government faces a dire economic crisis, which if left unchecked could 
lead  to  a  further  deterioration,  and  possibly  heightened  social  unrest, 
which  could  negatively  impact  the  Peace  Process.  </a></p>
<p><a id="248" name="248">Indeed,  unless  the 
government  succeeds in  mobilizing  financial  assistance,  we  can  expect  a 
deepening  crisis.    </a></p>
<p><a id="249" name="249">It  will  be  forced  to  monetize  the  deficit  resulting  in 
higher inflation and a greatly depreciated exchange rate, and all gains on 
the  stabilization  front  achieved  over  the  last  year  will  evaporate.  </a></p>
<p><a id="250" name="250">Real 
incomes will continue to drop and the hope for stability and recovery will 
be pushed further into the future.</a></p>
<p><a id="251" name="251">

After  so  many  years  of  protracted  conflict  there  is  weariness  among  the 
general population and a heightened desire for peace.</a></p>
<p><a id="252" name="252">The country can ill 
afford  to  continue  the  current  path.  </a></p>
<p><a id="253" name="253">Much  rests  on  the  successful 
conclusion of the HLRF and a renewed commitment from all stakeholders 
to adhere to the CoHA and to fully implementing the revised ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="254" name="254">My 
hope  is  that  the  HLRF  process  will  result  in  all  the  parties  agreeing  to 
resolve  disagreements  over  the  remaining  substantive  issues,  which 
appear to divide them.

In the meantime, alongside providing active support to the IGAD Special

continue its oversight and monitoring responsibilities, receive reports from 
all  ARCSS  institutions  and  mechanisms,  as  well  as  report  regularly  in
