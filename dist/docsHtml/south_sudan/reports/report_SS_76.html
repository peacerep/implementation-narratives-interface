Executive Summary 

1.  </a></p>
<p><a id="33" name="33">This first Report of the Reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (RJMEC) 
on the status of implementation of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict 
in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) covers the period from 1st October to 31st December 
2018.  </a></p>
<p><a id="34" name="34">It  highlights  activities  around  the  establishment  or  reconstitution  of  all  but  two  of  the 
Agreement institutions and mechanisms, as well as confidence building measures that has taken 
place since the signing.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">In addition, it focuses on incidents of compliance or lack thereof with 
the terms of the agreement, report violations of the provisions of the R-ARCSS, and underscores 
the engagement of the RJMEC leadership with the parties, regional guarantors and stakeholders 
of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">2.  </a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">The general political and security atmosphere has been conducive for implementation of the R-
ARCSS with a commendable show of commitment and cooperation exhibited by all the Parties, 
even  though  economic  hardship  and  logistical  constraints  persists.  </a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">Overall,  there  has  been 
significant  progress  made in  the establishment and reconstitution of the  requisite Agreement 
institutions  and  implementation  mechanisms  for  the  Pre-Transitional  Period.  </a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">Only  the 
Independent  Boundaries  Commission  (IBC)  and  the  Disarmament  Demobilization  and 
Reintegration (DDR) Commission  remain outstanding.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">All  the others have commenced their 
work and are making progress.  
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">3.  </a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">The Report notes that since October 2018, the implementation of the Permanent Ceasefire has 
improved  as  demonstrated  by  the  gradual  decrease  in  fighting  among  the  warring  Parties  as 
reported  by  the  CTSAMVM.  </a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">This  is  mainly  attributed  to  the  confidence  building  measures 
initiated by the IGAD Mediation in early October, and the Party leaders' demonstrable political 
will  to  work  together.  </a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">These  measures  included  several  visits  to  Wau  and  Leer  by  senior 
Government and military leaders, following fighting between SSPDF and SPLA-IO forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">This 
reportedly ended the skirmishes in mid-November. 
 

4.  </a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">There is a great deal of work that still needs to be done by the security mechanisms in a very 
short time frame.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">There are also very obvious areas of contention and disagreement.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">Moreover, 
little has been done to prepare the population in general and the armed forces in particular for 
cantonment, DDR and unification of forces, which are critical before the Transitional Period 
commences. 
 

5.  </a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">On the humanitarian front, the Report notes that at least 4.4 million people were severely food 
insecure during the reporting period and this number is expected to increase to over 5 million 
by early 2019.</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">Moreover, aid workers reportedly experienced denial of access to certain areas 
and the killing of two aid workers in October, brought the total killed in 2018 to 14.  </a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">On the 
economy  the  exchange  rate  remained  relatively  stable  and  inflation  dropped  appreciably. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">However, at the same time world oil prices began a marked decline during October and persisted 
throughout the period adversely impacting government’s revenue.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">6.  </a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">The  report  concludes  that  while  it  is  commendable  that  all  members  of  the  Agreement 
institutions and mechanisms already established and reconstituted are now working from Juba, 
much work remains to be done.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">Funding and technical expert support are major challenges in 
the implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="58" name="58">Moreover, the presence of non-signatory armed groups in 
the field is a matter of serious concern that requires sustained diplomatic and political actions 
by the IGAD and the international community.</a></p>

I. Introduction 

1.  </a></p>
<p><a id="60" name="60">This Report is submitted pursuant to Chapter VII, Article 9 of the Revitalised Agreement on the 
Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) and covers the period 1st 
October to 31st December 2018.  </a></p>
<p><a id="61" name="61">For the period under review most of the activities revolved 
around continuation of confidence building measures and the establishment and reconstitution 
of  the  various  Agreement  institutions  and  implementation  mechanisms.  </a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">The  confidence 
building measures included meetings of the incumbent TGoNU leadership with that of the other 
Parties  to  the  R-ARCSS  and  other  stakeholders,  a  peace  celebration  in  Juba,  the  release  of 
several detainees and prisoners of war by both the incumbent TGoNU and other Parties, and the 
return to Juba by several high-ranking opposition members to participate in the various meetings 
of the Agreement institutions and implementation mechanisms. 
 

2.  </a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">Unfortunately, the period was also marred by some incidents of violations including sporadic 
fighting  in  a  few  areas  of  the  country,  a  report  of  mass  rape  in  Bentiu,  and  the  obstruction, 
detention and abuse of members of a CTSAMVM team by the national security apparatus.</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">With 
regards  to  these  incidents  the  Reconstituted  Joint  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Commission 
(RJMEC) immediately wrote to the TGoNU requesting investigations and a subsequent report 
to RJMEC’s leadership on any action taken.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">It also duly notified the IGAD Council of Ministers 
on the developments.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">

 

3.  </a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">The  Report  therefore  focuses  on  the  activities  of  the  newly  established  or  reconstituted 
Agreement Institutions and Mechanisms and the prevailing political, security, humanitarian and 
economic  situation  in  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan.  </a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">It  also  highlights  the  activities  of  the 
RJMEC, and progress made since the signing of the R-ARCSS on 12th September 2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">Finally, 
it  proposes  a  series  of  observations  and  recommendations  aimed  at  setting  the  stage  for 
successful monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>

Overview 

4.   </a></p>
<p><a id="72" name="72">During  the  period  under  review  the  main  activities  focused  on  either  the  establishment  or 
reconstitution  of  the  various  Agreement  institutions  and  implementation  mechanisms  by  the 
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), all of which are mandated under the 
R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="73" name="73">These are the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC), National Pre-
Transitional  Committee  (NPTC),  Joint  Defense  Board  (JDB),  Joint  Military  Ceasefire 
Commission  (JMCC),  </a></p>
<p><a id="74" name="74">Disarmament  Demobilization  and  Reintegration  (DDR)  </a></p>
<p><a id="75" name="75">Commission, 
Joint Transitional Security Committee (JTSC), National Constitutional Amendment Committee 
(NCAC),  Technical  Boundaries  Committee  (TBC),  International  Boundaries  Commission 
(IBC), and the Strategic Defense and Security Review Board (SDSRB).</a></p>
<p><a id="76" name="76">With the exception of 
the TBC, IBC and DDR Commission, all the other mechanisms and institutions were duly set 
up during the reporting  period.</a></p>
<p><a id="77" name="77">The reconstitution of the Ceasefire  and Transitional Security 
Arrangements Monitoring and Verification Mechanisms (CTSAMVM) took place in September 
2018.</a></p>

Agreement Institutions and Implementation Mechanisms 

5.  </a></p>
<p><a id="80" name="80">The  NPTC  was  established  in  October  2018  in  Khartoum  where  it  adopted  its  Terms  of 
Reference and rules governing the management of the NPTC Fund.</a></p>
<p><a id="81" name="81">Subsequent meetings of the 
Committee have been held in Juba with the participation of all ten members.</a></p>
<p><a id="82" name="82">It has established 
a  Secretariat  and  constituted  different  committees  responsible  for  the  various  tasks  to  be 
undertaken by the mechanism.</a></p>
<p><a id="83" name="83">Under the terms of the R-ARCSS the NPTC has the function of 
oversight and coordination of the implementation of the activities of the Pre-Transitional Period. 
 

6.  </a></p>
<p><a id="84" name="84">Following  the  reconstitution  of  the  NCAC  on  22nd  October  2018  in  Khartoum  members 
reconvened in Juba where at least three weeks were spent incorporating the R-ARCSS into the 
Transitional  Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan  (TCRSS)  2011.  </a></p>
<p><a id="85" name="85">However,  the 
Committee did not reach an agreement on one provision relating to the description of the system 
of  government  during  the  Pre-Transitional  and  Transitional  Periods.  </a></p>
<p><a id="86" name="86">This  issue  was 
subsequently  forwarded  to  the  RJMEC  for  its  consideration  and  intervention.  </a></p>
<p><a id="87" name="87">RJMEC 
accordingly  set  up  a  Committee  comprised  of  senior  leadership  of  the  Parties  to  resolve  the 
matter.</a></p>
<p><a id="88" name="88">The NCAC has since embarked on making amendments to the national security laws.  

 

7.  </a></p>
<p><a id="89" name="89">The reconstitution meeting of JMEC took place on 19th November 2018 in Addis Ababa with 
the  participation  of  all  its  43  members  where  new  Rules  of  Procedure  were  adopted.  </a></p>
<p><a id="90" name="90">A 
subsequent meeting was held in Juba on 12th December.</a></p>
<p><a id="91" name="91">Reports were received from the  NPTC, 
UNMISS, NCAC, CTSAMVM, and the SDSR Board.</a></p>
<p><a id="92" name="92">The interim Chairperson urged all parties 
and stakeholders to observe the permanent ceasefire provisions and ensure its observation in all 
parts  of  the  country.  </a></p>
<p><a id="93" name="93">He  further  appealed  to  the  IGAD  Special  Envoy  for  South  Sudan  to 
pursuade all groups who are non-signatory to the R-ARCSS to join in its implementation.</a></p>
<p><a id="94" name="94">

</a></p>
<p><a id="95" name="95">Security Mechanisms 

8.  </a></p>
<p><a id="96" name="96">On  22nd  October  2018  the  IGAD  Chiefs  of  Defence  Staff/Forces  and  the  Chief  of  Defence 
Forces  of  Rwanda  met  in  Khartoum  and  discussed  the  way  forward  regarding  the  Regional 
Protection Force (RPF).</a></p>
<p><a id="97" name="97">Subsequently, an assessment team was sent to South Sudan to report 
on  the  political  and  security  situation  on  the  ground.  </a></p>
<p><a id="98" name="98">The  assessment  team  then  submitted  a 
report to the IGAD and Rwanda Chiefs of Defence.</a></p>
<p><a id="99" name="99">The Chief of Defence /Staff Forces after 
receiving the assessment team’s report deliberated and agreed as follows:</a></p>

<p><a id="116" name="116">From  25th  to  29th  November,  the  IGAD  Special  Envoy  for  South  Sudan  reconstituted  and 
established the following key security implementation mechanisms:</a></p>

<p><a id="121" name="121">and  the  JMCC.  </a></p>
<p><a id="122" name="122">All  the  four  mechanisms  held  their  initial  meetings  in  Khartoum  and 
worked on and produced their rules of procedure, terms of reference, and made decisions on 
critical  issues  they  needed  to  take  action  on  in  their  future  meetings.  </a></p>
<p><a id="123" name="123">These  mechanisms 
subsequently met in Juba in December 2018 with the exception of the JTSC.

<p><a id="128" name="128">The SDSR Board

women from Civil Society Organizations (CSO) and the SPLM/A-IO.</a></p>
<p><a id="130" name="130">A follow up meeting was 
held in Juba from 21st  to 22nd  December 2018.</a></p>

<p><a id="134" name="134">In general, the political situation in South Sudan during the reporting period has been calm and 
stable.  </a></p>
<p><a id="135" name="135">The  confidence  building  measures  highlighted  earlier  contributed  to  an  improved 
relationship between the leadership of the various Parties to R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="136" name="136">That notwithstanding, 
the  period  also  witnessed  internal  leadership  wrangles  within  the  South  Sudan  Opposition

<p><a id="139" name="139">Since  October  2018,  the  implementation  of  the  Permanent  Ceasefire  has  improved  as 
demonstrated  by  the  gradual  decrease  in  fighting  among  the  warring  Parties  reported  by  the 
CTSAMVM.</a></p>
<p><a id="140" name="140">This is mainly due to confidence building measures that were first initiated by the 
IGAD  Mediation  in  early  October,  and  by  the  Parties  through  their  political  leaders' 
demonstrable political will.</a></p>
<p><a id="141" name="141">In particular, the National Peace Day that was celebrated in Juba on 
31 October 2018, and attended by thousands of South Sudanese, political leaders from all the 
Parties to the R-ARCSS, as well as IGAD Heads of State and government and the international 
community representatives in Juba, all contributed.</a></p>

<p><a id="147" name="147">By  the  end  of  December  2018,  the  situation  between 
SSPDF and SPLA-IO Forces improved from a tense standoff to relative stability in most parts 
of the country as field commanders from all sides convened occasional meetings to build trust 
and confidence.</a></p>

<p><a id="149" name="149">14.</a></p>
<p><a id="150" name="150">The Parties' efforts to fully implement the Permanent Ceasefire notwithstanding, CTSAMVM's 
new concept of operations helped to improve the situation on the ground.</a></p>
<p><a id="151" name="151">Its operations were 
decentralized through the introduction of a sector system of Monitoring and Verification Teams' 
deployment.  </a></p>
<p><a id="152" name="152">This  concept  coupled  with  the  addition  of  two  more  helicopters,  afforded 
CTSAMVM quick response capability to incidents and flexibility, which was lacking during 
the implementation of the ARCSS from 2015 to mid-2018.</a></p>
<p><a id="153" name="153">In addition, CTSAMVM proactively 
initiated  confidence  building  measures  such  as  regular  meetings  and  information  sharing 
between and among field commanders of the warring Parties, thereby preventing clashes, rather 
than reacting to incidents.  
 

</a></p>
<p><a id="154" name="154">15.</a></p>
<p><a id="155" name="155">Examples of the above-mentioned confidence building measures are:</a></p>
<p><a id="156" name="156">several visits to Wau and 
Leer by senior government and military leaders, following fighting between SSPDF and SPLA- 
IO forces, which arguably influenced the ending  of the skirmishes in mid-November.</a></p>
<p><a id="157" name="157">At the 
time of this Report Wau was calm and the surrounding region quiet.</a></p>
<p><a id="158" name="158">Government and military 
leaders continued to make frequent visits.</a></p>
<p><a id="159" name="159">

 

16.  </a></p>
<p><a id="160" name="160">CTSAMVM  continued  to  report  the  Parties'  compliance  with  several  provisions  of  the 
Permanent  Ceasefire  in  many  parts  of  the  war  affected  areas.  </a></p>
<p><a id="161" name="161">This  includes  the  freezing  of 
forces, access to CTSAMVM MVTs to verify forces, notification of movement of forces and 
efforts to disseminate Chapter II provisions of the R-ARCSS to all forces.</a></p>
<p><a id="162" name="162">Despite these positive 
reports  and  efforts  by  the  signatories  to  pursue  implementation,  there  has  nevertheless  been 
some disturbing incidents of violations.</a></p>

<p><a id="165" name="165">In December, CTSAMVM reported significant skirmishes between the SPLA-IO and SSPDF 
in  former  Unity  State  and  small-scale  clashes  that  continued  until  December  2018  between 
armed  groups  and  the  SSPDF.  </a></p>
<p><a id="166" name="166">The  situation  was  further  complicated  by  a  rising  number  of 
inter-communal clashes in the State, much as a result of cattle rustling.</a></p>
<p><a id="167" name="167">The Parties to the R-
ARCSS are very concerned about the threat to the Peace Process these clashes present and the 
incumbent TGoNU has placed a high priority on re-establishing the rule of law in the region.

<p><a id="196" name="196">Conflict in hot spots and other violations during the reporting period are generally the result of

<p><a id="197" name="197">However, the key 
factor that has been affecting the full implementation of Chapter II activities has been the delay

<p><a id="352" name="352">RJMEC welcomes the nomination of experts by IGAD and TROIKA to the TBC but again calls 
on the AU C5 countries to make available the remaining members of the IBC so that it too can 
begin  its  work.  </a></p>
<p><a id="353" name="353">The  work,  conclusions,  recommendations  and  their  timing  by  the  IBC  has 
obvious implications for the length of the Pre-Transitional period and the putting in place of the 
R-TGoNU.</a></p>
<p><a id="354" name="354"> 
  

55.</a></p>
<p><a id="355" name="355">The  Parties  to  the  R-ARCSS  are  demonstrating  commitment  to  the  Permanent  Ceasefire  as 
exemplified by the number of confidence building activities that have been executed at all levels 
of command, the political will expressed and demonstrated by the coming to Juba by members 
of  the  opposition  despite  their  initial  security  concerns,  the  TGoNU's  commitment  to  fund 
activities  by  all  security  mechanisms  despite  the  meagre  resources,  and  the  consequential 
gradual reduction in armed violence and humanitarian violations by the Parties.</a></p>
<p><a id="356" name="356"> 

 

</a></p>
<p><a id="357" name="357">56.</a></p>
<p><a id="358" name="358">The  fighting  in  former  Unity  State,  the  reported  serial  SGBV  attacks  around  Bentiu  and  the 
arrest, detention and abuse of the CTSAMVM MVT has undermined the confidence building 

 

15 

measures undertaken by SSPDF, SPLA-IO and SSOA field commanders, but has not derailed 
the implementation of the PCTSA.</a></p>
<p><a id="359" name="359">The presence of non-signatory armed groups in the field is 
a matter of serious concern that requires sustained diplomatic and political actions by the IGAD 
and the international community. 
 

57.</a></p>
<p><a id="360" name="360">While it is commendable that all members of the security committees are now working from 
Juba, it is important to note that real work has not yet started, and hence they are encouraged to 
start rolling out their workplans with specific activities, timeframes and budgets.</a></p>
<p><a id="361" name="361">Funding and 
technical expert support are going to be some of the major challenges in the implementation of 
Chapter  II  activities.  </a></p>
<p><a id="362" name="362">Therefore,  the  Parties  should  be  more  realistic  in  designing  their 
workplans.  </a></p>
<p><a id="363" name="363">However,  even  if  all  boards  and  committees  start  work,  their  efforts  will  be 
undermined by the absence of the DDR Commission.</a></p>
<p><a id="364" name="364"> 

 

58.</a></p>
<p><a id="365" name="365">To this end the IGAD Special Envoy and the NPTC should urgently meet and address all the 
issues regarding the reconstitution of the DDR Commission.</a></p>
<p><a id="366" name="366">The JDB and the JMCC should 
also  work closely and  agree on a  feasible  cantonment approach that  takes into account  local 
realities,  scarcity  of  resources  and  the  spirit  of  the  Agreement  that  aims  at  the  total  and 
permanent termination of war.</a></p>

the detention and abuse of the CTSAMVM monitors.</a></p>
<p><a id="370" name="370">These actions can potentially undermine 
the conducive political security environment created for the implementation of the R-ARCSS. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="371" name="371">In that regard RJMEC renews its call to the incumbent TGoNU to conduct a speedy, transparent 
and timely investigation into the attacks, apprehend the perpetrators and hold them to account. 
</a></p>
<p><a id="372" name="372">Also  the  proposed  joint  investigation  team  into  the  violence  perpetrated  on  the  CTSAMVM 
MVT must be constituted and deployed so as to expedite issues of accountability.</a></p>
<p><a id="373" name="373">

 

60.</a></p>
<p><a id="374" name="374">Further,  RJMEC  calls  on  all  Parties  to  facilitate  alleviation  of  the  humanitarian  crisis  by 
ensuring  full  and  unconditional  humanitarian  access  to  all  areas  with  populations  in  need  as 
prescribed  in  the  R-ARCSS  and  the  2017  CoHA.  </a></p>
<p><a id="375" name="375">This  includes  upholding  international 
humanitarian law, and an end to the killing and detainment of aid workers.

<p><a id="376" name="376">The  decline  in  world  oil  prices  has  created  further  strains  on  the  economy  and  threatens 
economic stability just at the time when it was appearing to turn around.</a></p>
<p><a id="377" name="377">Should the oil price 
remain  low,  the  value  of  the  in-kind  deliveries  to  Sudan  will  not  be  sufficient  to  pay  down 
arrears owed to Sudan and could lead to further complications in budget execution.</a></p>

<p><a id="379" name="379">Conclusion 

62.</a></p>
<p><a id="380" name="380">After  three  months  of  implementation  of  the  R-ARCSS  which  saw  the  establishment  and 
reconstitution of all except two of the Agreement institutions and mechanisms much remains to 
be done if the Pre-Transitional period is to go in accordance with the agreement timelines.</a></p>
<p><a id="381" name="381">It’s 
becoming  quite  clear  that  the  delay  in  the  work  needed  to  be  pursued  by  the  security 

 

16 

mechanisms, and in particular the cantonment of forces and the building of the national army 
may delay the start of the Transitional period.    
 

63.</a></p>
<p><a id="382" name="382">The NCAC will continue to pursue its review of the security laws with a view to creating a solid 
basis  for  a  secure  and  stable  security  environment  in  which  peace  can  prevail.  </a></p>
<p><a id="383" name="383">CTASMVM 
despite the recent incident will continue with its monitoring, verification and reporting activities 
in  a  timely  fashion  to  RJMEC  and  IGAD  in  order  that  the  necessary  action  be  taken  when 
required.</a></p>
<p><a id="384" name="384">   

 

64.</a></p>
<p><a id="385" name="385">RJMEC on its part shall continue to impartially monitor, evaluate and report as it vigorously 
carries out its oversight responsibilities with regards to the R-ARCSS, and make interventions 
when necessary.</a></p>
<p><a id="386" name="386">It will also continue regular reporting in writing to the incumbent TGoNU, the 
TNLA,  the  Chairperson  of  the  IGAD  Council  of  Ministers,  the  Chairperson  of  the  African 
Union Commission, the Peace and Security Council of the AU, and to the Secretary General
