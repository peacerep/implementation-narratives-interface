<p><a id="43" name="43">The standard of proof used by CTSAMVM to determine whether there is sufficient

monitoring mechanisms and human-rights- and humanitarian- entities and
signifies that sufficient facts and evidence have been collected to conclude that

Yei and a criminal case file was opened.

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">On the same day 16 December 2022 the commander of the SSPDF Air Defence
Component heard of the rape and immediately contacted the Chairman of the

violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically articles 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0, 2.0.10.0.4,
2.0.10.0.5  and the ACOH articles  (1), (a),  (b) and (g).

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

13.In</a></p>
<p><a id="62" name="62">March 2019 the SSPDF launched an Action Plan to address conflict-related
sexual violence.</a></p>
<p><a id="63" name="63">The first pillar of this Action Plan is Prevention, and the plan
itself goes into detail about what needs to be done to prevent acts of sexual
violence;</a></p>
<p><a id="64" name="64">specific measures include training, sensitisation and orders.</a></p>
<p><a id="65" name="65">CTSAMVM
recommends that the SSPDF revisits this Action Plan and increases efforts to
prevent these incidents happening.

14.</a></p>
<p><a id="66" name="66">The second pillar of the Action Plan is Accountability.</a></p>
<p><a id="67" name="67">CTSAMVM commends the
SSPDF for taking immediate action to identify the perpetrators and hold them to
account.

15.</a></p>
<p><a id="68" name="68">CTSAMVM notes that in this case all the correct actions were taken.</a></p>
<p><a id="69" name="69">There have
in the past been delays in criminal proceedings by the Police in Yei caused by the
failure of the victim/survivors to return ‘Police Criminal Form ’, which has to be
signed by a doctor.
