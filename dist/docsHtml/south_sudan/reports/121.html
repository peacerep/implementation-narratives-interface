EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
On  September 2021 the body of a man — reportedly killed by an elephant - was
found at Robijo, which is about  Km from Loa in Eastern Equatoria State.</a></p>
<p><a id="11" name="11">The Boma
Chief at Loa was informed, and he went to visit the site together with another civilian
and Col Julius Ojja Erneo Ali SPLM/A-IO (known as Col Ojja) who was with the Boma
Chief at the time.</a></p>
<p><a id="12" name="12">Col Ojja was based at Ashwa Cantonment Site.
</a></p>
<p><a id="13" name="13">When Col Ojja, the Boma Chief and the other civilian arrived at the scene they found
a Joint Patrol Team (JPT) at the site.</a></p>
<p><a id="14" name="14">JPTs are composed of SSPDF, NSS and SSNPS
and have the task of protecting civilians using the highway.</a></p>
<p><a id="15" name="15">There was also a CID
officer from Nimule in attendance, who had been called to the scene by the JPT.</a></p>
<p><a id="16" name="16">The
JPT personnel suggested that Col Ojja and his companions should report the incident
to the Wildlife Office in Nimule, and to that end, they offered them a lift to their base at
Gelle.</a></p>
<p><a id="17" name="17">However, on arrival at Gelle Col Ojja and the two civilians were arrested.</a></p>
<p><a id="18" name="18">The
two civilians later reported they were accused of being “rebels”, beaten and detained;</a></p>
<p><a id="19" name="19">
they also said Col Ojja attempted to escape but was shot and wounded.</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">The two
civilians were released on 11 September 2021, but Col Ojja remained in custody and
has not been seen nor heard from since.
</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">The commander of the JPT, Lt Col Atem Mading, SSPDF, has denied any knowledge
of the incident and the whereabouts of Col Ojja.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">However, CTSAMVM has evidence
that Col Ojja and his two civilian companions were taken by the JPT to Gelle on 
September 2021, and that Col Ojja was not released with the two civilians on 114
September 2021.
</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">By beating Col Ojja and the two civilians and then failing to release Col Ojja, the JPT
under the command of Lt Col Atem Mading acted in violation of the R-ARCSS

Assessment

16.CTSAMVM has confirmed that on  September 2021, the JPT based at Gelle was
under the command of Lt Col Atim Mading SSPDF.

17.On  September Col Julius Ojja Erneo Ali SPLM/A-IO, Chief Taban James Vuga,
and Mr Acika Joseph were taken to the JPT base at Gelle, where they were beaten.
</a></p>
<p><a id="105" name="105">According to Chief Taban James Vuga and Mr Acika Joseph, Col Ojja was shot
and wounded whilst trying to escape.</a></p>
<p><a id="106" name="106">He was not released with his two civilian
companions on 11 September 2021, and there is no information about his
whereabouts.

18.</a></p>
<p><a id="107" name="107">The SSNPS in Nimule had no knowledge of the arrest.

19.</a></p>
<p><a id="108" name="108">Lt Col Atim Mading’s statement that he was unaware of the arrest and detention
of the three men is not credible.</a></p>
<p><a id="109" name="109">His team called the CID to the site of the dead
body, and the CID officer and other witnesses saw them getting into the JPT
vehicle.</a></p>
<p><a id="110" name="110">Neither of the arrested civilians identified Lt Col Atim Mading when they
described their beating and detention at Gelle, however Lt Col Atim Mading clearly
told the commander of Ashwa Cantonment Site that Col Ojja and the two civilians
were in his custody when called on  September 2021.

20.By arresting, detaining and mistreating Col Julius Ojja Erneo Ali SPLM/A-IO and
the two civilians, Lt Col Atim Mading SSPDF and the other members of the JPT
acted in clear violation of the R-ARCSS.

21.</a></p>
<p><a id="111" name="111">There a number of other allegations being investigated by CTSAMVM involving the
detention and mistreatment of SPLM/A-IO officers and soldiers in Eastern and
Central Equatoria.                                                        

</a></p>
<p><a id="112" name="112">Conclusions
22.CTSAMVM concludes that:</a></p>
<p><a id="113" name="113">

a. By arresting, detaining and mistreating Col Julius Ojja Erneo Ali SPLM/A-IO
the SSPDF has acted in violation of Article 2.0.9  of the R-ARCSS of 12
September 2018 and has engaged in acts prohibited by Article Six of the
Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities of 21 December 2017 (ACOH) as
incorporated into Article 2.1.10  of the R-ARCSS.

b. By arresting, detaining and mistreating Chief Taban James Vuga and Mr Acika
Joseph the SSPDF has failed to fulfil its obligations to protect civilians as
required by Articles  and  of the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities of 21
December 2017, as incorporated into Article 2.2.10.0  of the R-ARCSS.</a></p>
<p><a id="114" name="114">and
Article 2.0.10.0.4  of the R-ARCSS.

</a></p>
<p><a id="115" name="115">c. The incident indicates that SSPDF failed to exercise command and control by
properly training soldiers to refrain from acts of hostility, violence against
civilians and failure to adhere to the protection of human rights of civilians at
all times to ensure safety and dignity of individuals and communities in violation
of Article 2.0.10.0.4.

Observations and Recommendations
23.</a></p>
<p><a id="116" name="116">It is recommended that:</a></p>
<p><a id="117" name="117">

a. The Government clarifies the location and status of Col Julius Ojja Erneo Ali.

b. JDB takes the appropriate action to improve relations between the SPLM/A-IO
and SSPDF in the Juba-Nimule road area.

•- Any arrests and detentions carried out by security forces be conducted in
accordance with the Transitional Constitution of South Sudan and the Penal
Code Act 2008.
d. Parties are reminded that any arrest or detention of officers from another Party
should be communicated to that Party and the reasons provided.
