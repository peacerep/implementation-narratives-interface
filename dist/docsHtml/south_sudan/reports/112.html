Introduction
, Background:</a></p>
<p><a id="20" name="20">

a. There have for a long time been tensions between the SSPDF garrison in
Nassir and the surrounding population.</a></p>
<p><a id="21" name="21">There is an SPLI/A-IO garrison at
Ketbeck which is only about  Km from the SSPDF garrison.

b. The last incidents reported in the Nassir area were on  August and 
September 2020, when some local youths allegedly killed an SSPDF soldier,
and this led to a revenge attack in which some youths were killed.</a></p>
<p><a id="22" name="22">However,
following a CTSAMVM Joint Field Visit on  October 2020 a Peace and
Reconciliation Conference was convened between the Parties in Mandeng on
20 October 2020 and since then until 14 March 2021 the area has been calm.

2. Incidents and allegations

a. On 15 March 2021 CTSAMVM received information from the commander of
the SSPDF Special Operations Brigade in Nassir, Maj Gen Gordon Banak
Thoan, that on 14 March 2021 an SSPDF Officer had been attacked and killed
on the riverbank by the “White Army”, and that SSPDF troops had pursued the
alleged perpetrators to villages near Kedbeck.

b. Later on 15 March 2021 CTSAMVM received an allegation from SPLM/A-lO
Sector  Commander Lt. Gen Peter Thok Chol Luak in Mandeng, that on 14
March 2021 the SSPDF attacked and burnt down the villages of Luak Wien,
Koat, Cie-thor and Wunthow in revenge for the killing of the SSPDF officer by
“unknown armed civilians”.</a></p>
<p><a id="23" name="23">Lt</a></p>
<p><a id="24" name="24">. Gen Peter Thok Chol Luak went on to allege
that on 15 March 2021 the SSPDF launched an “aggressive attack” against the
SPLM/A-IO barracks in Kedbek and burnt it down.</a></p>
<p><a id="25" name="25">There were no reports of
casualties.

3. Methodoloay:</a></p>
<p><a id="26" name="26">
a. CTSAMVM visited Nassir and Mandeng on 17 March 2021,

Gen Salva Kiir Amet, was also present,

ii, At Mandeng CTSAMVM met the SPLM/SA-IO Sector  Commander Lt

b. The standard of proof used by CTSAMVM to determine whether there is
Sufficient evidence to verify that a Party is not in compliance with the provisions
of the Agreements is “reasonable grounds to believe that the incident that is
the subject of the investigation occurred.”</a></p>
<p><a id="27" name="27">This is in accordance with accepted
practice for monitoring mechanisms and humanitarian entities and signifies
that sufficient facts and evidence have been collected to conclude that an event
has occurred.

returned to normal since the events of 14 and 15 March 2021.

down his weapon and escaped.

7.</a></p>
<p><a id="35" name="35">On 15 March at 6.0  the SSPDF left their barracks and advanced to and
threatened the SPLM/A-|O garrison at Kedbeck.</a></p>
<p><a id="36" name="36">However, the SPLM/A-IO had
been ordered to withdraw and only a small guard force was left.</a></p>
<p><a id="37" name="37">The garrison was
burnt as were several surrounding villages.</a></p>
<p><a id="38" name="38">According the SSPDF the fires were
started by tracer bullets;</a></p>
<p><a id="39" name="39">according to the SPLM/A-IO they were started
deliberately.

8.</a></p>
<p><a id="40" name="40">Lt Gen Peter Thok Chuol Luak said that when they saw the garrison and villages
being burnt SPLM/A-IO forces started to mobilise, but he stopped them and instead
called the SSPDF commander Maj Gen Gordon Barak and asked him to pull his
forces back,

9.</a></p>
<p><a id="41" name="41">Both the SSPDF commander and the SPLM/A-IO commander agreed the incident
could — and should — have been resolved amicably.

</a></p>
<p><a id="42" name="42">Joint Defence Board (JDB) visit 19 March 2021

,On 19 March 2021 the JDB visited the SSPDF garrison in Nassir and the SPLM/A-
 Garrison in Ketbeck in order to defuse tensions following the incident, The JDB
party included Gen Johnson Juma Akot, SSPDF CDF and JDB Co-Chair, Lt Gen
Gabriel Duop Lam, SPLM/A-IO Deputy Chief of Staff and JDB Co-Chair, Lt Gen
Julius Tabuley Daniel SSOA JDB Co-Chair and senior representatives from JTSC
and JMCC.

11.</a></p>
<p><a id="43" name="43">During the visit the senior JDB members all emphasised the importance of peaceful
coexistence.</a></p>
<p><a id="44" name="44">Gen Johnson Juma Akot stated that Maj Gen Gordon Banak Thoan
had been recalled to Juba to be investigated as a result of what happened.

Assessment

12.</a></p>
<p><a id="45" name="45">lt was agreed and understood by both the SSPDF and the SPLM/A-IO that the
killing of the SSPDF officer was by armed civilians.</a></p>
<p><a id="46" name="46">Each Party had a different
version of exactly what happened.

13.0 n 14 March 2021 the SSPDF left their barracks, moved to and searched civilian
houses following the killing of the officer.</a></p>
<p><a id="47" name="47">The SSPDF did not, at this stage, contact
the SPLM/A-IO to discuss the incident and what should be done as a result.

14.On the morning of 15 March 2021 the SSPDE left their barracks and advanced to
and threatened the SPLM/A-IO barracks at Ketbeck, The garrison and some of
the surrounding villages — where soldiers lived — were burnt.</a></p>
<p><a id="48" name="48">By leaving their
barracks and advancing to the SPLM/A-IO barracks the SSPDF in Nassir acted in
clear violation of the R-ARCSS.

15.A potential clash between the SSPDF and the SPLM/A-|O was avoided by the
actions of SPLM/A-1O Sector  Commander Lt Gen Peter Thok Chuol, who ordered
his soldiers to withdraw from Ketbeck and not to engage the SSPDF.

16.</a></p>
<p><a id="49" name="49">The recall and replacement of the SSPDF commander in Nassir, Maj Ben Gordon
Banak Thoan, and the subsequent visit by the JDB did much to reduce tensions in
the area,

Conclusion

17.</a></p>
<p><a id="50" name="50">Itis the conclusion of CTSAMVM that by leaving barracks on 15 March 2021 and
advancing to and burning the SPLM/A-IO barracks in Ketbeck the SSPDE acted in
clear violation of the R-ARCSS, specifically article 2.0.9:</a></p>
<p><a id="51" name="51">“No revenge, vengeance

or retribution and any kind of violation of the Permanent Ceasefire is allowed under
any circumstances.”
Observations and Recommendations
18.</a></p>
<p><a id="52" name="52">The killing of the SSPDF officer on 14 March 2021 was a tragic incident which
resulted from some sort of altercation with armed civilians,  Following the Peace
and Reconciliation Conference in Mandeng on 20 October 2020 the mechanisms
have been in place to manage these sorts of incidents.</a></p>
<p><a id="53" name="53">It was unfortunate the
SSPDF commander decided to take direct action rather than contact the SPLM/A-
 commander and resolve it amicably.
19.</a></p>
<p><a id="54" name="54">The SPLM/A-IO acted commendably during the incident, and the SSPDF and JDB
must also be commended for their actions taken after the incident:</a></p>
<p><a id="55" name="55">
a. The SPLM/A-IO refrained from reacting to the SSPDF advance to their
barracks at Ketbeck.
</a></p>
<p><a id="56" name="56">b. The SSPDF took quick remedial action by replacing the SSPDF commander
in Nassir.
</a></p>
<p><a id="57" name="57">c, JDB acted swiftly to defuse tensions in the area
</a></p>
